<h3>Finding a dream-like duplex in the Upper East Side</h3>
<p>It takes just a word to sum up this family’s home-finding experience: miraculous. In the cosmopolitan stretches of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where even the parks are tiny and concrete-dipped, Jenn and Jon, six-year-old Elliott, two-year-old Abigail, and their Cockapoo, Zucca, found a place that can only have dropped out of a dream. The 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Yorkville, a tony area near the East River’s edge, was in a 1910 building a stone’s throw from Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor’s residence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43295 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43298" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg" alt="Duplex floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The story was that decades back, a former owner of the five-floor, then ten-unit building had combined three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. “W<span class="s1">e fell in love with the unbelievable backyard garden</span>,” said Jenn, the executive director of a family foundation, not to mention the amazing location. The problem was—and every Manhattan miracle has one—that the duplex needed renovation work.</p>
<p>From what Jenn and her partner, Jon, a lawyer at a bank, could see, little had been touched since the 1970s. The floors throughout were in poor condition. The white laminate kitchen was 40 years old and had an unfriendly layout. It was a daunting prospect for a couple with no construction experience, but before long, they were in contract. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their duplex renovation</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their design-build firm</a>, and jumped in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43220" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10.jpg" alt="Stairs in a duplex renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Plotting the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; for the duplex renovation</h3>
<p>Jenn and Jon planned on four months for the duplex renovation. &#8216;Apartment is in good shape and does not need to be gutted,&#8217; they’d stated in their Sweeten post. “We knew we needed a full reno on the galley kitchen,” Jenn said, “but most everything else just needed a serious refresh.” Light updates were given to the 2.5 bathrooms including the master, the kids&#8217; bath, and a half bath.</p>
<blockquote><p>We fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the “Must Do” list finalized, Jenn and Jon got to work with their Sweeten contractor’s design team. “We wanted a transitional-modern space that was light and airy,” Jenn said. “Our look, playing off of the brand-new white oak floors we were putting in and the existing black hardware like the stair rail and window frames, was ‘black, white, and wood.’” For inspiration, they followed the Instagram #BlackWhiteWood hashtag, which delivered great ideas.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Beginning in the kitchen, they got to work on what bothered them most: not old cabinetry, but two light-blocking openings that made the galley room feel closed off. The first was a partial wall between the eating area and the kitchen. The second, on the opposite end, was a too-small pocket door inhibiting flow to the living room. “The ground floor has only two natural light sources—the front kitchen window, which overlooks the street, and the garden door to the back—so this opening up was essential,” Jenn said.</p>
<p>By knocking out the divisive walls, they maximized light and flow, making the kitchen a focal point of their home and family life. “Having a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family was one of our priorities,” Jenn said, “and we fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43297 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg" alt="living room leading to outdoors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) First-floor family room</em></span></p>
<p>In the kitchen and the apartment’s other rooms, Jenn and Jon selected materials in classic styles, like Shaker cabinets and five-panel doors, but finished with a modern flair. “We said no to crown molding,” Jenn said, “and kept the four-inch floorboards natural by sealing them with a white-infused stain.” As planned, they riffed off the existing black hardware, but mixed in metals, including brass light fixtures and stainless kitchen appliances, to relax the overall effect. They were stymied by the choices—working across so many rooms, they seemed endless. “It was hard making so many ‘permanent’ decisions over a short time,” Jenn said.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">They soon realized they would have to install new white oak floors throughout, since the existing ones were stained, warped, or patched with cheap flooring that had been laid down years ago. (“They were mismatched, different heights, just an overall disaster,” Jenn said.) </span><span style="color: #333333;">The stairs and risers, however, were sanded and stained to match the new floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiators worked</a>, but needed covers; the through-wall air conditioners screamed for an upgrade. The <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets would get built-ins</a>, and the family needed more shelves, nooks, and stowaways up and down. New doors and molding would be necessary. Oh, and of course they would paint—everywhere.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43228" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43223" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-13.gif" alt="bedroom closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A large bedroom on the second floor—that was once two separate rooms— would be divided again into two kids’ rooms complete with new closets in each. Their bathrooms, formerly a Jack-and-Jill with two entrances, had a wall built in turning them into two separate spaces once again. </span></p>
<p>“Jon was the one with the vision,” Jenn said. “We bought the apartment knowing it would need work to feel like our ‘forever home,’ but I was concerned going in about how much effort it would require.” They’d preferred a turnkey place but realized, having looked long and hard, that finding a comparable, renovated apartment they could afford, especially in such a prime location, would be near-impossible. And so, with a commitment to work together—because they’d heard too many stories of renovations tearing couples apart—they agreed to make it happen, in the name of a big, beautiful city home.</p>
<h3>Getting a hang of the renovation learning curve</h3>
<p>As first-time renovators, Jenn and Jon not only felt overwhelmed by the day-to-day, but knew little about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgets, timeframes, or permits</a>. “We went in blind and had to learn fast!” Jenn said. <span class="s1">Because of this, and due to large last-minute changes to the plan—including an unforeseen full-frame exterior backdoor to the garden and brand new solid hardwood floors throughout—they exceeded their budget by about 30%.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43217 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg" alt="Guest bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) Half bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p>Still, Jenn said, it was worth it. “Our new home has significantly impacted our quality of life. The garden, where the kids can run free, is the biggest contributor to that, but a fabulous eat-in kitchen and two floors for stretching out are big assets, too,” she said. “To us, the place lives more like a house than an apartment—we are truly in love.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A family of four didn’t have to look far to find their brand new home</h2>
<p><em>They say that a little can go a long way, and that proved true for one Upper East Side couple who, looking to expand their living space, set their sights on a smaller one-bedroom apartment next door. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Posting their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, they were paired with both a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten architect</a> as well as <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor from a design-build firm</a>. Together, they were able to turn 700 extra square feet into the master bedroom, den, closets, and living/dining room their growing family needed.</em></p>

<p>A few factors came together to set this project in motion: For one, 1,100 square feet can start to feel tight with two growing teenagers. Our boys had been sharing a room and the need for more personal space was apparent now that both were in high school and required designated areas where they could do things like homework. We were also looking to host friends and family more often, which we rarely did since our original living/dining room could only accommodate a few people at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41062 size-full" title="before and after floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" alt="before and after floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>When the couple next door decided to sell their one-bedroom apartment and move back to England, it seemed like a unique opportunity and the perfect way to get the extra space we needed. Plus, it would allow us to stay in the building and neighborhood we really liked—a smallish co-op located on a lovely block in the East 70s on the Upper East Side of New York City. So we bought it.</p>

<p>We were not <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-stories-vol-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovators</a>—we had previously remodeled the kitchen—but the scale of this project was much larger than our earlier ones. Sweeten was invaluable in helping us attract several potential design partners that we never would have found otherwise. Our goal was to leave as much of our original apartment intact as possible, knocking out the separating wall and combining it with the one-bedroom that we purchased to create a den, closets, and a larger living/dining room, and a master suite on the opposite side of the apartment from the boys’ rooms so we could each enjoy our own space.</p>

<blockquote><p>The architect we chose was key in helping bring our vision to completion from visualizing the space to their thoughtful assistance in evaluating the contractors’ bids&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The smaller apartment’s bedroom/bathroom/kitchen was converted into our master suite, including a walk-in closet and bathroom. We essentially removed the kitchen and converted it to a nice-sized bathroom, which included keeping the window so that it now sits on the side of our roomy shower. (We had intended to add a powder room but unfortunately, the placement of pipes, some of which were not movable, made this impossible.)</p>

<p>What is now the TV room and den—a big favorite for watching sports or movies—sits astride with what was the wall separating the two apartments. We also made some modest renovations to the two bathrooms in the larger apartment including replacing the tile floors, adding in new sinks, enclosures, and toilets, one new medicine cabinet, and a fresh coat of paint. If we had a bigger budget, we might have done more.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41044 size-full" title="entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Aesthetically speaking, we lean heavily toward simplicity in design and function. The apartment already had traditional crown moldings and built-in bookcases, which are beautiful, but we used a mix of modern furniture and art for a look that combines both modern and traditional style. The dark floors we had in our original apartment were extended throughout the space—white oak stained in walnut with a satin polyurethane—contrasting the white walls for a clean, relaxing yet luxurious feel.</p>

<p>The Sweeten architect we chose was such a key partner in helping us bring our vision to completion, from helping us visualize the space to their thoughtful assistance in evaluating the contractors’ bids to helping solve problems, big and small, along the way.</p>

We learned that when we opened the walls and ceilings and found that a previous renovation by the unit above had cut pipe channels and damaged the structural beams between floors. The building inspector required that this be remediated, even though it wasn’t part of our unit, and that added a few months and an undesirable sidetrack to the original scope of our work. But after the demolition of the dividing wall, which looks out onto 78th Street&#8217;s picturesque row of brick townhouses, it literally took our breath away to see the open space and the sunlight spilling through the windows.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26840" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Adding storage and style to a haphazard kitchen in Manhattan’s Upper East Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Treanna embarked on the search for her new home, she knew that apartments within her budget would probably require a remodel of some kind. She set out to find one in which she would only need to redo one of the two big-ticket items—the kitchen or bath—but not both. When she saw the kitchen in her current apartment, located in a 1960s co-op building on the Upper East Side, she spotted a lot of underutilized space and a lot of potential. There was enough room for a full galley, while the current owners had only one wall of cabinets and appliances with a lone undersized fridge on the other side. All the appliances were rental-grade, and there was no dishwasher—a must for this enthusiastic home chef. The few cabinets that existed were mismatched, and the space flow was not good. As she closed on the apartment, Treanna <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While almost everything in the old kitchen had to go, Treanna found charm in the existing checkered black-and-white flooring, and it became the basis for the new color palette. She envisioned a calm, serene space in white and gray—anything dark would make the galley space feel too confined. “Open, inviting, and warm,” were the operative terms for the updated kitchen design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the guidance of her Sweeten design-build contractor, Treanna chose white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>, a light-colored Caesarstone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> with a bit of marbling, and a backsplash in clear and white tile (although the gray grout tinted the look of the clear tiles). Minimalist hardware in stainless steel finished the look. Working with just 42 square feet, Treanna and her contractor outfitted the space with ample storage by adding four custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-out racks</a> in addition to numerous drawers. The stainless steel range and dishwasher were installed on one side, while the microwave and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator</a> went on the opposite wall. Although the remodel took much longer than expected due to delays with co-op approval, Treanna is loving her new space—especially the pull-outs and the handy Delta touch faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Instead of wasting the dead space behind the cabinet toe kicks, the Sweeten contractor added additional drawer space and an ingenious pull-out step stool on wheels. Treanna had trouble reaching the top shelves in the kitchen and this was a way to keep a step ladder out of sight but easily accessible.</p>

</a>Guest post by Nancy in her Upper East Side studio apartment</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Nancy&#8217;s first New York City apartment was a long time in the making—35 years to be exact. She searched for a dream home in Manhattan where she could apply the movie set design playing in her mind, but none of the spaces felt right. So Nancy, who works in human resources, took matters into her own hands and purchased a 550-square-foot studio apartment on the Upper East Side that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s. Everything required an overhaul! To bring her vision to life, she made smart sacrifices in her narrow 6-foot-wide kitchen, turned a closet into a walk-in dressing room, and used wallpaper to carve out separate areas. You&#8217;ll want to read Nancy&#8217;s renovation journey.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;ve lived in the city my whole life and have spent the last 35 years mentally cataloging my favorite buildings, blocks, and parts of the city. When I decided to buy my first place a few years ago, I was living in Chelsea—and loved it—but knew I need to shift my search further uptown to get more for my budget. I had always gravitated towards the Upper East Side and gone to open houses on and off over the years. If there&#8217;s an elevator, doorman building without in-window air conditioning units (my only real deal-breaker) in the East 70s, I&#8217;ve probably been there at some point. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The first apartment I saw on my search was in the same line I’m currently living in but on a lower floor. The apartment had been redone in a style that was fine but not my own, and the alcove was turned into a narrow bedroom cut off from heat and air conditioning. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Fast forward a few months and I&#8217;d been turned off by so many similar “I could live with it, I guess” renovations that I was determined to buy a place that would require a lot of work, knowing I might need to sacrifice space for the ability to make my place my own. I had loved the location, building, and low maintenance costs of that first place I&#8217;d seen months ago and found a studio apartment on StreetEasy that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s, except for some new appliances–score! An offer was made, and I set out to renovate before moving in. I was excited that EVERYTHING required a refresh. My apartment is a decent-sized alcove studio—about 550 square feet—in a postwar Upper East Side high-rise. Since moving in, I&#8217;ve welcomed a fluffy new roommate named Hudson, who enjoys spending his days on the couch. We&#8217;re still working on getting him to embrace his dog bed.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I had heard about Sweeten from a few places—</span><span class="s1"><i>New York </i></span><span class="s1">magazine, Curbed, and even from a colleague who knew the founder—so it was the first place I turned to when looking for a contractor. I met with a few matches and had a ton of questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*What would this cost (or rather, can I do all this with what I want to spend)? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How long would it take? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How easy is it to get all my plans approved by my co-op board and the city? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d been dreaming of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this project</a> since I first discovered HGTV and had a pretty clear vision of what I had in mind: </span><span class="s1">a light and airy space&#8230;a dreamy beach house vibe that a character in a Nancy Meyers movie was tragically forced to squeeze into a tiny New York studio apartment (the “It’s Complicated” kitchen will have to wait). </span><span class="s1"> That said, I knew I needed a lot of help executing that vision and managing all of the pieces of a renovation that don&#8217;t find their way onto a Pinterest board. My Sweeten contractor was great at figuring out the best way to rewire the space, upgrade the electric panel, add in a ceiling light in the living space, inject new life to the parquet floors, and bring the plumbing up to standard.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">My contractor and I spent a ton of time playing with the footprint. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Should we close off the alcove?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Turn the small linen closet into a new entrance for a dressing room/bathroom?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Open up the kitchen and wrap the cabinets into the living space? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Expand both the closets into a small extra room and move the living space to the windows?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Ultimately, we decided to keep the footprint as-is, but widen the kitchen entrance that led into the living space, reconfigure the walk-in closet to be more user-friendly with french doors, and turn the cramped sleeping area closets into an open dressing room. I was always excited about the storage in the apartment, but now it&#8217;s much more efficient. Everything is put away in its own place and the storage blends into the look of the space.  </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The other big question was the kitchen layout. I dragged my mom—fresh off two of her own major kitchen renovations—to IKEA on multiple occasions to work out a footprint that would achieve two things in the small space: provide as much drawer storage as possible and add a dishwasher. After one particularly insane mock-up where I had almost convinced myself I could turn the 6-foot-wide space into a galley kitchen with a dishwasher drawer stacked over an oven (must have been Swedish meatball-induced temporary insanity), we realized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> were the way to go. Surprisingly, Home Depot came through with their Innermost collection where each piece could be semi-customized to bring the cabinets to the ceiling and turn a corner into usable space. I love that I was able to fit a shallow utensil drawer below the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a>. Choosing to forego the standard oven range was probably my most &#8216;controversial&#8217; decision—I really wanted that dishwasher—but I&#8217;ve come to love the induction top that fits into the countertop. The combo microwave/convection oven is perfect for my needs—it cooks just as well as most of the tiny apartment ovens and frees up a ton of space.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The rest of the decisions were mostly a balance between putting my stamp on the place and keeping resale in mind. I decided to go more traditional with the permanent kitchen and bath fixtures, but have more fun with the wallpaper, fabrics, lighting, and other decorative items. Using the Tanzania wallpaper print in the entryway helped define the space and kept with the black-and-white color palette. When I decided to keep the studio apartment as an open plan, I still wanted to keep the bedroom area defined as its own and the wallpaper from Flat Vernacular—which I’m in love with—does that well. It also keeps with the light feeling of the space. My contractor suggested molding with clean profiles—it&#8217;s actually just lumber—that works perfectly with the simple baseboards. I love the detail on the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doors</a> that have a simple style but give a bit of interest around the casing, which also helps relieve any warping with time. The floors were sanded down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refinished</a> in a matte gray tone.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The cramped, shallow bathtub was replaced with a large shower, making the space feel more open and so much more functional—perfect for containing Hudson’s bathtime messes. The deep <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage cabinet</a> above the toilet was one of the few things I&#8217;d probably do differently as it was a gaffe on my part. I ordered the cabinet without paying attention to how far out it would protrude—it&#8217;s 10-inches deep—and was installed with tile around it before I realized. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but using a shallow medicine cabinet would have been a better choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As with any reno, there were some hiccups along the way with permits taking a long time to come through and building regulations stopping work for any and all holidays. The 60-year-old pipes burst downstairs onto some very understanding neighbors, and then from above onto my freshly renovated space about a week after everything was done! </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweeten was a great partner along the way. Once I posted my project, they helped me figure out what I could do with my budget and asked the right questions so I could evaluate the bids I received. </span><span class="s1">They were a great sounding board when faced with questions during the process, such as delays and increased costs. I definitely recommend any renovator to use the Sweeten team to understand all the moving pieces throughout the process. Having lived in my space for some time now, I love it, and there isn&#8217;t much I would do differently. I am getting the bug to renovate and decorate a new space. So who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll be calling Sweeten again soon with a new space to refresh!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping for Manhattan real estate, you don’t always get what you want. For Gall, a patent attorney who grew up in Florida, an extended search for a new Manhattan apartment took him and his wife first across town, into an unexpected neighborhood, and subsequently through an impressive renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23270 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gall was living in a Hell’s Kitchen one-bedroom with his wife Ingrid, a Brazilian-born speech pathologist. They initially discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn’t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building “right on top of the subway,” he notes.<br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23267 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan-543x668.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="543" height="668" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23269 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1-720x495.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01" width="720" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23263 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980’s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000’s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn’t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was a real estate broker’s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their remodel</a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June. Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui</span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style="font-weight: 400;">ght at the entrance. “It had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,” Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple’s design inspiration for cool mirror doors—on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet—that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white oak floors in another project the team had completed; Gall and Ingrid instantly fell in love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the new island where the wall<span style="font-weight: 400;"> once stood. “By opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,” he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall oven</a> and separate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23278 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23279 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In t</span>he master bathroom, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa. Gall praises the three-dimensional renderings created by his Sweeten contractor, which were a great help for imagining the look of the kitchen. “We’re not visual people, and that made the process much smoother and easier.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23282 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23281 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23280 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closet organization in the master bedroom was built to the homeowners&#8217; exact requests, not only providing more than adequate storage, but the cabinet doors matched the rest found in the apartment. For the nursery, the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Upper east side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1058" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple’s renovation. “We had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn’t walk out on us,” he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child, and the job was finished before the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s dispatch comes from the interior designer of a New York City apartment re-do. Samantha was brought on to help modernize a client’s apartment, and while she was up for leading the ambitious design needs, she needed help finding a general contractor who could execute beautifully on the plans. Her client had filled his home with art and travel finds over the course of four decades in the space, and what started as a “refresh” project evolved into a total apartment renovation to create a light and bright canvas for treasured pieces and cherished friends. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Samantha Stein, Interior Designer</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stars aligned when a good friend put me in touch with a potential client I’d known for years. Ron, the homeowner, had been living in the same Upper East Side post-war apartment for 40 years (!) and was ready for some interior changes to freshen it up. We met to discuss priorities and a design vision, and then turned to Sweeten for help choosing a contractor for </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were able to use Sweeten’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">network to narrow our contractor choice down to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one firm</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was experienced and great to work with. They had a reasonable price for our initial wish list, and after we began working with them, we grew more comfortable expanding into more custom solutions and additional scope, for what would ultimately become a full gut renovation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the theme of the renovation was a relatively minimal ‘refresh’ &#8211; new paint, strip and refinish floors, clean-up details such as the custom five inches of crown molding in the living room, add custom millwork covers for the old and dilapidated radiator units, and complete a full renovation of the very outdated kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18494 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18493" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron, the client, wavered back and forth about updating his traditional apartment into a more modern space with an open-concept living and kitchen area. Ultimately, however, his classical taste and the way he uses the apartment in his daily life led us to leaving an enclosed kitchen, but updating its finishes and changing a few details to make the whole living area feel larger and flow more seamlessly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We removed both doors to the kitchen in favor of open entryways, demolished the two china cabinets that were edging into the dining space, and intended to continue the existing parquet into the kitchen. But, the more we discussed matching the existing parquet in rooms that had either outdated carpeting or badly damaged linoleum, the trickier it seemed it would be to get the clean, flowing feeling that Ron was looking for. After weighing costs and options with George&#8217;s team, we decided that going with a wide-plank engineered wood throughout the entire apartment (with the direction of the planks leading your eye out to the living room windows) was the right solution for a cohesive, flowing apartment. Ripping out the parquet allowed us to fully level and soundproof the subfloor, as well as fully waterproof the kitchen area. Great sighs of relief went up all around when the 40+ year old parquet and carpeting pieces were hauled out, and the textured wood floors (supplied by Glen Floors) look fantastic. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron has a fabulous lifelong collection of china, music, and incredible books on art, music, and travel that were hiding around the apartment. So, one of the top priorities for the renovation was storage. Curating a selected display of these items felt to me the best way to celebrate his travels and life experiences – they should be an integral part of the apartment without looking kitschy or messy. I had originally proposed a huge built-in wall of custom shelving and cabinetry, but pricey bids from other contractors made us step back. Once we started with George&#8217;s team, however, we felt confident we could bring back this concept to make up for the lost kitchen/dining storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We drew inspiration from several interiors that featured shelving surrounding a ‘nook’ for the sofa, and Michael and Dennis were able to help us flawlessly execute this vision with a stunning custom piece. The weight of the real wood doors, soft-close hinges, adjustable shelving, and hardware we selected from Nassau Suffolk Hardware make it all fit in perfectly—it’s hard to believe it wasn’t there before. We added two brass sconces from Ralph Lauren Home to softly light the sofa area at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="dark wood floors" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> </span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="traditional dining table" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was where the majority of the hard work happened. Our expert team was able to match my every demand. We re-centered the sink on the windows, removed a dropped ceiling section just above the windows, and gained upper cabinets by replacing the double wall ovens with a more conventional range. We saved a ton on appliances with some lucky timing with a big sale at Thermador, and chose a refrigerator, gas range, recirculating hood, and dishwasher from their Professional Series line. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom cabinets, again made from real wood, fit perfectly and are of incredible quality. We ordered the Kohler sink from Wayfair and the Rohl faucet from Nassau Suffolk Hardware. Our experts helped us choose Caesarstone quartz countertops instead of a pricier granite or marble, and we are impressed with their quality. Under-cabinet lighting and a few LEDs above the sink, in addition to the overhead fixture, make for lots of different ways to light the kitchen at night. The kitchen alone makes the entire apartment feel new and fresh, and its traditional accents (crown molding and the custom bevel on the countertops) keep it in the same design family as the rest of the apartment. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom and living room, we carefully selected vintage rugs to soften the newly wood-clad floors. Custom millwork radiator covers with picture-frame molding and Caesarstone tops replaced falling-apart metal enclosures for the A/C and heaters under the windows. Each has a powder-coated metal grill inset into the top and they act as gorgeous shelves to display a few more curios. These new units alone make the apartment look so much better! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Dennis also helped us outfit each of the seven closets in the apartment with custom shelving, so that we could reorganize all of Ron’s belongings to make more sense for his daily use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="custom radiator millwork covers" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18505" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="traditional bedroom aesthetic" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were so happy with their work that toward the end of the project, we even decided to hit on a long term wish list item for Ron: a deep-soaking tub in the master bath, and brand new shower and sink hardware (all from Rohl through Gracious Homes) in both bathrooms!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="rohl shower faucets" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18508" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="large format white shower tiles" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the full renovation took a lot of hard work, energy, and time. Ron loves showing off his new space and everyone is thrilled with the results. We’re grateful to the team at Sweeten for matching us with George and his crew, who were dependable and creative. They were flexible enough to work with us to incorporate lots of changes on the fly, and helped make our initial fantasy vision into a tangible reality.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18452 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="white Caesarstone countertop" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18453 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18454 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="stainless undermount sink" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18455" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-08-10.gif" alt="Bertazzoni range" width="600" height="797" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a new contender in the tiny urban kitchen competition! </span><strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/annes-sweetened-willow-street-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A half galley in Brooklyn Heights</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has held the honor up to this point, but a 25-square-foot Upper East Side kitchen looks like it might edge out all competitors. With an eye on re-sale value, the owner of this Manhattan studio came to Sweeten to make the most of a small space with new finishes and a delightfully scrappy use of modern materials.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>“My contractor made my kitchen renovation a painless experience. He has an excellent eye for design and materials and is willing to work with your budget. His brother and the rest of the renovation team are incredibly hard-working and left the work site immaculate at the end of every day.”</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><i><i>&#8211; Upper East Side homeowner</i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After settling into her studio apartment in the Yorkville section of New York’s posh Upper East Side, this new homeowner saw opportunity in what felt like a “disaster”. The kitchen floor and subfloor were cracked, appliances were dated, the small sink and stove had no backsplash protection, and the nook was starting to look as if it hadn’t been cleaned in years. The tiny L-shaped kitchen soon became the main focal point for a makeover. Set on keeping the project within a specific budget, the studio’s owner </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project to Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we matched her with a Sweeten general contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a contractor with two decades of experience helping homeowners achieve quality renovations at every budget. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18264" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="797" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project post called for some specifics and laid out a few materials to avoid: yes to new white cabinets, Caesarstone counters, and subway tile, and no to floor grout that would attract grime. Her contractor got to work right away, removing all of the existing kitchen finishes to make way for more modern selects&#8211;without having to change the footprint. Charcoal-hued porcelain floor tiles replaced every bit of the dingy, broken originals, setting the tone for chic black and white all around. The original cabinets were torn out to make way for more modern Shaker-style white cabinets, maximizing additional storage space and finished with brushed silver metal pulls. The laminate countertops were swapped for a more luxe black Caesarstone with a stainless undermount sink and coordinating faucet that mimics the modernity of the cabinet hardware. The Sweeten contractor installed a gleaming subway tile backsplash in black glass, and crisp white paint brightens up the new space. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The studio’s owner went for stainless appliances in lieu of the older white originals, and she particularly wanted a vented hood for the oven range. The contractor saw to it that these accessories were incorporated in the design. A sleek new fridge took the place of the former, plus a gas range, coordinating hood, and a compact microwave right above it&#8212;a much better location than before when the microwave was oddly stuck between the fridge and sink. With contrasting black and white throughout the new space, and alternating matte and glossy surfaces, the new lighting pendant casts a gorgeous glow.</p>

<i>Guest post by Steve Townsend, Manhattan architect and homeowner </i><br />
<span id="more-16257"></span><br />
When I moved in with my girlfriend, Lauren, to our one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side, it was clear that the kitchen had suffered from some serious neglect. The apartment has been in her family for decades, with her parents purchasing it several years ago from her grandparents as an investment property. It has been an eternal revolving door of short-term family tenants. I am an architect and she works in television advertising, but it was apparent to both of us that the outdated design needed a remedy. Renovating the apartment was always an end goal, but having an architect in the relationship accelerated those plans, because: free obligated labor!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design problems with the kitchen were immediately apparent. The building was constructed in the 1970s, and apart from the finishes and appliances not being replaced throughout its lifetime, the layout harkened back to a simpler time – when nobody wanted to see their kitchens and apparently there was never more than one person in the kitchen at a time. It was remarkably small and completely enclosed—an ‘L’ shape configuration with a door at each end—with very limited counter and storage space. The walls ensured that no natural light made its way in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not typically on the client side of construction projects like this – typically the client handles finding and hiring the contractor, and as architects, we then work with whoever is contracted. Moreover, we typically engage in larger scale projects in New York and abroad, so our local network of contractors is limited. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> provided an instant network of screened contractors, who specialize in this scale and scope of project, and lined up a series of contractors who were both interested and qualified.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16284" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16285" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Because the design was finalized (rendering above) when we reached out to prospective contractors, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we were very clear with the plan</a>, we just needed someone who would complement our vision and desires. After meeting with Sweeten’s recommendations, we decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>. His team specializes in renovations like ours, and his aesthetic was remarkably aligned with our own.</p>
<p>The objectives of the design were simple: open up the whole space, maximize counter space without sacrificing storage, and obviously replace all appliances and cabinets. The new cabinets and finishes needed to be durable and the layout functional for two passionate chefs. The plan became pretty clear: blow out the walls and consolidate the appliances to the back walls.</p>
<p>We kept the existing ‘L’ configuration, but enlarged it by demolishing all of the partitions and replacing them with a large island. The island instantly doubled our counter space while adding all the below-counter storage. Because we enjoy hosting dinners and making cooking more of a communal experience, we opted for a two-tiered island with a counter-height side at the kitchen and a bar-height side facing the rest of the apartment. And since we eliminated two closets as part of the demolition, we included full height cabinets and shelves on the wall outside of the kitchen to serve as storage and a pantry closet, without intruding too far into the space.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>These changes gave us vast spatial improvement to the apartment and made room for a complete update of all the appliances. We knew we wanted professional-grade appliances and we let these choices serve as the foundation of many design decisions. In order to get the feeling of a commercial kitchen, the appliances are stainless steel, which go well with the rest of the space. We opted for a large <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluestar</a> 6-burner range, which is really the centerpiece of the new equipment, as well as a Fridgidaire fridge and a KitchenAid dishwasher.</p>
<p>In order to accentuate the openness and lightness of the new design, we decided to go with all-white finishes for all the vertical surfaces – custom white lacquered cabinets and white subway tile for the backsplash and other walls. In order to contrast the white surfaces, we decided on a dark gray Caesarstone counter and a ceramic floor tile in a similar hue.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16260 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="white lacquered kitchen cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>Kris&#8217;s experience in this kind of work was invaluable throughout the process, and when minor hiccups occurred – as they invariably do in these types of projects – his creativity and expertise always led to innovative solutions. The end result is a really fantastic change from the original apartment. Aside from now having a better functioning and more practical layout for a kitchen, the whole apartment is brighter and more open.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marble tiles, a sleek pocket door, and new laundry facilities round out this Upper East Side bathroom</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14709 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Laura and Peter bought their one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op on Manhattan’s Upper East Side in 2013. During the apartment hunt, this arts professional and consultant pair decided they really wanted a home with an in-unit washer and dryer. Some buildings allowed washers and dryers and some did not. Still others had flip-flopped on the­­­ matter altogether: buildings that once allowed in-unit washers and dryers later changed their minds—grandfathering in appliances installed before the change while banning newcomers from adding them. When Laura and Peter sealed the deal on their new place in a building that allowed laundry appliances, the hustle was on to install a set pronto, before any potential shift down the road.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“Our expert team was so helpful &#8212; Ed and Valeria did a lot of really beautiful work and were easy to get in touch with while we weren&#8217;t living there. Ed was excellent about working with our building and super and they both helped with photos and phone calls whenever we had delivery issues, which was often.”<span id="more-14708"></span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>&#8212; Laura, Upper East Side homeowner</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Peter eyed a hallway closet as the future home of their laundry nook, but the plan took on a choose your own adventure angle as the couple needed help to determine whether the work might necessitate opening the walls in the kitchen or bath, both adjacent to the laundry spot. Laura was also plagued by the daily reminder that the bathroom had no nearby heat source. With floor-to-ceiling travertine tiles, it felt like a Tuscan-inspired igloo on chilly mornings. Plus, the extra-wide pedestal sink put the shower tap just out of her reach – an unfortunate design flaw in an otherwise compact room. Laura <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted the project on Sweeten</a> and we introduced Sweeten Experts Valeria and Eduard, owners of a Brooklyn design-build firm, to make this all work. Valeria and Eduard cut through the walls to make the call that the new laundry closet would share water access with the bathroom, meaning game on for a full bathroom renovation!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14858" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04-copy.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04 copy" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04-copy.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04-copy-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura drew inspiration from the iconic black and white tile in so many bathrooms she toured while apartment-hunting. In went white marble floor tiles accented with miniature black diamond tiles, all from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>. This ageless flooring masks a big-time modern improvement: radiant floor heating lies just underneath and is connected to a timer that gets the heat going every morning. Laura and Peter continued a luxe look up the walls with 12” marble square tiles, a subtle rounded tile border, and custom marble shower shelves, all with materials found at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom gained a sleek pocket door (with beautifully crafted custom molding created by Eduard) and Laura found a console sink that combined the look of an old-fashioned marble sink with more modern chrome lines. The couple found multiple ways to echo these clean lines with a simple squared  <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler tub</a> and sliding glass doors, European-inspired <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Standard shower fixtures</a>, a dual-flush toilet from <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and a deco lighting fixture sourced from Lighting District. Valeria and Eduard also made room for a <a href="https://shop.panasonic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panasonic</a> ceiling fan and side-by-side <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robern medicine cabinets</a>, both mirrored inside and out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All together, the new space is brighter and warmer than ever before. And the washer and dryer that started it all? The contractors transformed the interior of the hallway closet with blue-gray paint and stacked a white <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch washer and dryer</a> next to revamped hallway linen storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Gennadiy was incredibly prompt, fast, and had great ideas and attention to detail. The thing we valued most was that he was very respectful of our budget, but at the same time shared our commitment to using high-quality materials. He was a great guide in knowing where to spend versus save.&#8221;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Sarah, Upper East Side Homeowner</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9136 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah, an editor at Vanity Fair, &amp; her husband Michael, a reporter for Bloomberg News, purchased their first home in the Upper East Side late last year. Almost immediately, the enterprising young journalists set out to make an important update to the space; the two love to cook, eat, &amp; entertain, but since their apartment, c. 1910, had very few updates made to it in the last 100 years, renovating the kitchen was top priority. Sarah &amp; Michael knew what they wanted for the new space, taking a direction rooted in the age &amp; tradition of the original home, rather than any Jetsonian ideal. So, with her own catalog of inspired ideas and a well-researched execution plan, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah posted to Sweeten</a> to find the perfect contractor for the work. From their matches, the couple chose to work with tS member Gennadiy Kaliberda, owner of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Fork Projects</a>. The charming new kitchen is a perfect model for the 21st C., traditional home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9137 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="721" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the original kitchen had charming bones, the space was overwhelmed by warm, reddish wooden cabinets &amp; trim that made it feel dark &amp; dingy, and a full set of outdated appliances added to the overall drabness. Sarah &amp; Michael appreciated the traditional character that runs throughout the entire home, so they planned for a makeover that would not undermine the spirit of the architecture. After much deliberation, the sensible solution was to paint their existing cabinets.<span id="more-9040"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The lower cabinets were high-varnish, auburn-colored oak—all contemporary, not original. Though they &#8216;clashed&#8217; in age with the old wood, they had the upside of being on new drawer tracks and in great condition. The upper cabinets, the hutch cabinet, and the dark hardware were original to the apartment, circa 1910, and their functionality (on new hinges) was fantastic, but they were riddled with wood putty spots and pockmarks from a century of use.&#8221; </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9138 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="721" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to connecting with Gennadiy, the homeowners independently sourced &amp; replaced the appliances and hired a painter who specializes in historic interiors for the cabinet painting. To transition the warm wooden scheme into something more modern feeling, that would also blend well with the addition of stainless steel appliances, the couple chose a light cool grey paint, <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=coolbreeze&#038;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BM Cool Breeze</a>. Sarah&#8217;s favorite element &#8212; and a worthwhile splurge alongside the economic cabinet update &#8212; is the range. The <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/H304GGVCR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni Heritage Series in Matte Cream</a> fits perfectly as a modern throwback to an earlier tradition. At this stage, the homeowners were ready to move forward with Gennadiy for their countertop, sink, backsplash &amp; cabinet replacement glass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9139 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completed space is bright, cozy, and almost pastoral, with a balanced palette of warm and cool. The new palette was inspired partially by a similar scheme Sarah had come across in a book of Scottish country houses.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Overall, the inspiration was as much outdoors as in—I kept thinking of a kitchen you could imagine being right off of a sprawling herb or vegetable garden. Maybe if Beatrix Potter had a New York pied-a-terre.&#8221;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9140 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most inventive elements of the new design is the use of antiqued mirror panels in place of the former, contemporary set in frosted glass. This suggestion came from Sarah&#8217;s aunt as a way to increase the natural light in the space, but it also ties in perfectly with the vintage theme. Sarah sourced custom-cut, 12&#8243;x12&#8243; mirror-glass panels in &#8216;French Antique&#8217; finish from <a href="https://www.antiquemirrorglassshoppe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timeless Reflections</a>. After installing the glass panels, Gennadiy sealed on &amp; painted wooden backings inside the cabinet doors to create a solid, clean construction. For the backsplash, Sarah &amp; Michael re-routed their initial plan to use wainscoting, and instead selected a classic-looking carrera marble subway tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9141 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finding a farm sink that would work well in the space proved to be the biggest challenge of the renovation, but, determined to find exactly what she was looking for, Sarah eventually lucked out with the last one available &#8212; perhaps, anywhere. A bridge <a href="https://rohlhome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faucet from Rohl&#8217;s Country Kitchen collection</a> completes the sink basin&#8217;s farmhouse look, and for the countertops, the homeowners chose Brazilian soapstone, fabricated by <a href="https://www.soapstones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M. Teixeira</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Gennadiy and I worked like dogs to find a fireclay farm sink that would work for a New York apartment kitchen. They’re so heavy and so huge—most are 30 inches wide and 10 inches deep, which would swallow the entire counter—that we had to really scour for one small enough, shallow enough, and with the clean, traditional shape that I wanted.  This was the sole one that would work and, coincidentally, the very last one in a showroom I called. Even in its diminutive (by farm sink-standards) size, we still had to opt for an upmount to clear the plumbing and keep the top drawer functional.  I actually like the look of it better this way—it makes more of a pronounced statement.&#8221;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9142 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the antique, marble &amp; iron garden table from Italy, which Sarah purchased through a <a href="https://www.potomackcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potomack Company</a> auction. On the hutch cabinets, chicken wire &amp; custom toile curtains give subtle suggestions of being out in the European countryside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9143 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than painting the doors &amp; transoms above, these wooden surfaces are left intact &#8212; the new contrast makes them more pronounced than ever before.</p>
<h2>&#8220;[Gennadiy] works really well with young clients because he’s tech-savvy and good with communication. He’d be picture-messaging me close-ups of the veining on my marble tile from the showrooms so we could discuss it, or sending me daily photo updates—we never felt that dreaded feeling of wondering why our contractor’d gone AWOL, ever.&#8221;</h2>
<p>We love the new space and admire Sarah &amp; Michael&#8217;s sharp planning and great eye for detail &#8212; awesome work to Gennadiy, and many thanks to the happy homeowners for sharing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-93RD-STREET-HOUSE.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1495 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-93RD-STREET-HOUSE.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-93RD-STREET-HOUSE.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-93RD-STREET-HOUSE-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>After living in New York City for fifteen years I&#8217;ve become a big fan of apartment living.  It&#8217;s sensible and ecologically sound.  We accumulate fewer things, leave a reduced footprint, and free up space around us for parks and plazas.</p>
<p>Yet my Dream Home has always been a wood frame house.  This might be a memory of my childhood house, a tidy split-level on a cul-de-sac in Connecticut.  And it might reflect my New England upbringing.  I love the simple, taut volumes of colonial homes, broken only by small windows and doors.  My Dream Home is a saltbox with a stubby brick chimney and a red door.  Sometimes I imagine my Dream Home beachside on a grassy field dotted wit hydrangea bushes, and sometimes I imagine it on a square lawn sheltered by maple trees and a low stone fence</p>
<p>It&#8217;s illegal to build a wood frame structure now in New York City. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/realestate/29cov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of nineteenth-century wood houses</a> were carefully maintained, have survived, and are grandfathered into the building code.  There are a few in my neighborhood and each time I pass one it conjures up the Dream Home.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1496 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This house, on East 92nd Street, is at the end of a year-long restoration.  Just the other day it received a final coat of white paint.  For many years it had seemed a bit haunted, with shuttered first floor windows, peeling blue paint, and empty planters.  The rickety wood porch and shutters sagged badly and the whole structure looked as if it were ready to collapse, as if it were being propped up by the two large brick buildings to either side.  Its owners have done a great job fixing the facade, restoring the original wood trim and siding, and adding a low stone patio in front.  I can only wonder what work they&#8217;ve done inside.</p>
<p>As an architect one of the loveliest things to see is a wood house go up.  There&#8217;s something magical about the way the frame emerges from a haze of 2&#215;4&#8217;s, and something reassuring about the way men build it so simply and quickly with hammers and nails. Maybe technological advances will give us a way to construct a wood frame that&#8217;s less vulnerable to the elements, and we can fill empty spots all over the city with small wood houses again.</p>
