<p>When shopping for cabinets, your lifestyle, plus the materials available, will guide and influence the appearance of your cabinet doors. Do you like the traditional Shaker-style door with its raised frame and crisp edges? Or a sleek flat-front contemporary panel? Are your kids opening and closing doors all day with sticky fingers? Or is your kitchen the entertaining hub of your home, one that you like to keep looking neat for visiting friends and family?</p>
<p>Just about any style of door panel you choose will offer a range of finishes, many of them protective. Here,<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, lays out how to choose the right kitchen cabinets.</p>
<h3>How to choose your cabinet door style</h3>
<p>Most commonly, the door is a flat panel, a raised panel, or a slab front. What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>A raised panel</strong> has a raised rectangular-shaped center and the surface surrounding it is recessed, creating a frame-like appearance. The raised center may be surrounded by other detailing, such as a beveled edge, and/or an arched top, providing a traditional appearance, like antique cabinetry. This style looks beautiful with painted or stained finishes that play up the three-dimensional qualities.</p>

<p><strong>A flat panel</strong> is three-dimensional as well, but the center panel is recessed (though still flat) and framed by two stiles (rectilinear panels at either side) and two rails (panels at top and bottom). This construction is not simply decorative. It was developed (hundreds of years ago!) to keep the door shape stable with fluctuating temperatures and moisture. Popular examples are Shaker and Craftsman style. You can also find some additional variation, with a glass insert that replaces some or all of the center panel (much like a true divided light window), or a beadboard center panel for a country or cottage effect.</p>

<p><strong>A slab front</strong> is made from a single piece of material—solid hardwood, MDF, or a wood veneer. Because it is one surface with no corners or recesses to capture grime, it is easy to keep clean with the swipe of a cloth.</p>

<h3>Cabinet door materials</h3>
<p>Are you warm to wood or is a sparkling white kitchen more your craving? You can find a vast variety of looks in budget, high-end, and luxury cabinets. The rarer the material—think, solid wood—the greater the price tag. Here’s a quick guide to materials from lowest to highest price:</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30487 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) </em>Custom cabinets with a walnut and mahogany veneer and inset doors in</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kim and Ian’s kitchen</a></p>
<p><strong>MDF or medium density fiberboard</strong> is manufactured under high pressure and temperatures by combining wood fibers with a resin binder to create door panels as well as the cabinet box. Because this type of material can be manufactured efficiently from wood byproducts, it’s typically the material for stock cabinets. It takes well to paint. Manufacturers will offer different glaze options to apply on top of the paint, so you can still achieve a custom look for a stock price.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36580 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<ul>
<li>Thermafoil is a scratch-resistant surface that is thermally glued and vacuum-sealed to MDF. It’s an option in the stock category and great for a lifestyle where the kitchen sees a tremendous amount of activity since it’s easy to maintain. Color choice is limited to white or linen.</li>
<li>Laminate is common in countertops. With laminate cabinets, it’s still a resin-saturated printed paper (commonly a high-res photographic representation of wood) fused to a particleboard or MDF core to create the panel. This offering is available in the stock category.</li>
<li>Veneer cabinets have real wood door panels for less than the price of solid wood. The wood surface here is less than a quarter of an inch and wrapped around an MDF panel for stability—good for areas with high humidity. The risk here is that if the wood is chipped or dinged, you will see the synthetic core, and it can’t be satisfactorily repaired; however, if your cabinets don’t see a lot of hard use, this is a well-priced option in the stock category.</li>
<li>Solid wood is the high-end or luxury category for cabinet doors. Each panel is unique, like the tree it was milled from. The big decision here is what species of wood. The most common are oak, maple, hickory, and cherry. All are hardwoods with a natural beauty and all take stain or paint well. Woods that are prized for their natural color and grain, particularly hickory and cherry, shouldn’t be painted.</li>
<li>Maple is a very hard wood, with a finer grain than oak, so it’s a good choice if you want a perfectly smooth finish for paint and/or glaze. With a clear finish, it takes a contemporary look, and with a deeper stain, it becomes more traditional.</li>
<li>Birch and ash are also durable hardwoods good for kitchen cabinets with more pronounced grains. You may remember pine from your grandma’s days. You can still find this classic, and its knotty grain has a rustic appeal, but as one of the softest woods, it will dent more readily than other species.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation of door styles</h3>
<p>The style of your kitchen cabinetry doesn’t stop with the door design. How the door lays on the box also affects the overall appearance; it’s another decision you will have to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full overlay: Doors (and drawers) cover the front of the cabinet box; hinges are hidden.</li>
<li>Partial overlay: Doors cover just a portion of the face frame; hinges remain concealed.</li>
<li>Inset: Doors are flush with the face frame of the cabinet box; hinges may be concealed or exposed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the types of kitchen cabinets?</h3>
<p>Your selection process will begin with the door material, as it takes the brunt of the action, swinging open and shut all day, every day. Cabinet doors attach as a cover to the storage compartment they serve to conceal—typically, a box made of wood, plywood, or a wood composite. Construction offered by manufacturers, along with price, is defined by three categories:</p>
<h4>Stock cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$60/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: MDF (covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate)</li>
<li>Box material: MDF</li>
</ul>
<p>Doors and their boxes come in a limited range of standard sizes. Boxes and doors tend to be made of MDF (medium density fiberboard, which is a composite of sawdust or wood fibers with resin to bind it) and covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate. Available from large retailers like Home Depot or Ikea, these cabinets can be good quality but are also the thriftiest choice. Prices vary across the country, starting at about $60 per linear foot and rising to a few hundred dollars, depending on any features you add. Most major manufacturers have a stock line. You may think that there are no options for customization in this category but some brands do offer upgrades such as glass doors or a selection of molding.</p>
<h4>Semi-custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$90/ linear foot and up</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: MDF or plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>A greater range of sizes and styles according to the manufacturer’s offering. Boxes may be constructed of MDF or plywood. Solid wood doors should be part of the selection, along with MDF and veneers. Expect to pay $90 per linear foot and upward, depending on what organization features or finishes you add on. Find this category at some home centers as well as independent kitchen showrooms that carry national brands offering both semi-custom and custom, such as Wellborn or KraftMaid.</p>
<h4>Custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$200 &#8211; $500/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: higher quality plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>Built to order to exact size specifications. Boxes tend to be higher-quality plywood and doors are solid wood in a range of species. You may be able to find custom cabinets for under $200 per linear foot, but since everything is made to order to your exact dimensions (and will take longer to arrive at your doorstep, as much as three months, compared to five to six weeks for stock or semi-custom), the price rises considerably. You may pay as much $500 per linear foot and into the thousands for special woods and exterior details. Custom cabinetry is also available from national retailers, such as<a href="https://www.poggenpohl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Poggenpohl</a>,<a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bilotta</a>, and<a href="https://henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Henrybuilt</a>.</p>
<p>As you survey the landscape of kitchen door panels for your cabinets, be sure to ask for samples. You may even be able to borrow a door panel from a local showroom. As with any investment for your home, you will want to try it out before you commit. Hopefully, this Sweeten guide helps you choose the perfect cabinets best suited for your needs and style.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Open up a dark and cramped kitchen in Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Anne and Michael moved into their two-bed, one-bath apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops, the space was in need of an overhaul. Wisely, the couple decided to live with the kitchen for a couple of months to understand how to customize the space to their needs. They moved into the bedrooms but kept the living room and kitchen fairly empty. “We felt it was a plus to live in the space for a minute before diving into our first renovation, even if the space did feel quite sparse at times.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">The great views and natural light from the big windows became the focal point. In contrast, the small, cut-off kitchen was saddled with an outdated color palette and cheap materials: wood-paneled cabinets, a busily speckled countertop, and pink square floor tiles that brought out an unflattering orange hue in the cabinets. The two small doorways leading into the kitchen created an awkward flow and isolated the space from the rest of the apartment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Anne and Michael <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on Sweeten after being stuck in a “contractor no man’s land.” They had spoken to handymen who felt the scope of the project was too ambitious for their skills, while contractors they met only wanted to take on larger and more costly projects. “Neither of these options felt right. Sweeten was great; we posted the project and the budget and got serious responses from contractors specifically interested in a project of our size. Filling out the Sweeten project form helped us to clarify the specs of the renovation for ourselves as well.” This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a> turned out to be just the right fit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A reconfiguration of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor plan</a> eliminated the two small entrances and created a new, U-shaped kitchen that opened up into the dining space. This allowed more light into the kitchen while maintaining a separate cooking area. Anne and Michael also traded in the orange-brown-pink for a more subdued and calming color scheme. &#8220;Our contractor helped us source our appliances, counters, and backsplash tile, which we found really helpful as first-timers,&#8221; says Anne. Shaker-style cabinets were semi-custom in a cool, soft gray and paired with a backsplash made of small-scale white tile laid in a diamond pattern. After some delays and frustrations with the cabinets, they almost wondered if stock cabinets would have been the better decision. However, their contractor was patient and worked to get them back to a happy place—while still on budget. A full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> alongside the French door refrigerator adds much-needed storage space.  Their advice for future renovators? &#8220;It is such a cliché, but it&#8217;s going to take longer than you anticipate,&#8221; said Anne. They also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved out</a> during demolition. &#8220;We thought about muddling through and continuing to camp out in the bedrooms, but I think the work got done more quickly this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Having lived with compact appliances in a small rental kitchen, they were thrilled they could fit full-sized appliances AND the storage they wanted in their new kitchen. “We just hosted Thanksgiving for ten people, and the kitchen really worked from a storage and counter space perspective. It&#8217;s exciting to be able to host like that in our new home.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>With a lot of wasted space, Rashmi knew a more efficient floor plan was in order</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28399 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Rashmi" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Intelligent use of space in a Manhattan kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Rashmi purchased a one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side, she wanted to renovate the kitchen immediately. It was clearly run down, as the original kitchen in a prewar building, but had plenty of unused space and potential. “Once I moved in, I realized I needed to live with the space to understand what I really wanted,” said Rashmi. She gave herself six months—it took four years. At one stage, she even stored her bike in some dead space next to the fridge. She didn’t like the idea of an open kitchen, so knocking down a wall wasn’t an option. The main goal was to simply use the space effectively while flipping a hodgepodge of different whites into something bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Rashmi had owned a home before, but buying into a co-op was a new experience. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> and found a contractor through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted general contractors. She was having problems getting her package submitted to her co-op board for approval until she found her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. &#8220;My contractor was an invaluable partner, especially during the planning and approval phase with my co-op and the building engineers,” she said. Once work got underway, Rashmi decided to give the kitchen a roomier feel by opting for 18-inch cabinets on one side rather than the standard 24 inch. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer</a> was also “life-changing.” A layout geared toward casual entertaining was also important, so she <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended the counter</a> right along the wall to include an eat-in perch and two chairs. Rather than go with backsplash tiles, Rashmi chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semi-gloss paint</a> for ease of cleaning. She picked a bright yet deep blue for the walls that contrasted with gold-toned cabinet hardware.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Rashmi worked from home, so her Sweeten contractor and his team were conscious that they were sharing the same workspace. “They worked clean and were as quiet as possible,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Keeping gas and plumbing in place? A contractor may be all you need</h2>
<p>Ever imagine what’d it be like to take your kitchen down to the studs and start over again? We’re not talking about knocking down walls or changing the placement of the sink or range—or anything that would mean moving plumbing or rerouting electricity. What we’re talking about is a clean swap. Out with the old—cabinets, countertop, backsplash, appliances—and in with the new. Perhaps you’re just looking for a simple upgrade for your kitchen (and by simple, we mean minimal changes to the structure, plumbing, or electrical). Or you’re dealing with budget or structural limitations that require an architect. Whatever your reasons for this kind of kitchen renovation, which typically takes between 1-2 months to complete, a general contractor may be all you need for a total refresh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Philipa-Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26497 mb-10 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation with flat-front cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Philipa-Kitchen-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Philipa-Kitchen-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Philipa-Kitchen-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Philipa-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Philipa-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Philipa-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label"> A <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/quick-download-greenpoint-kitchen-basks-newly-found-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a> in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dark, crowded kitchen in Greenpoint was in desperate need of some lightening and brightening. The original kitchen had wood cabinets with a dark finish and a matching black backsplash and countertop that consistently showed dirt. In order to give this kitchen the facelift it needed, all of the kitchen cabinets were removed and replaced with white, flat-front <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets</a> to provide a more modern look. Some of the upper cabinets were removed to make way for open shelving to give the space an overall lighter feeling. The old countertop got swapped for stone in a medium gray shade and the backsplash was replaced with veined marble tile. While the homeowner kept the original appliances, new cabinets, shelving, counters, and backsplash gave the kitchen the boost it needed for a bright new beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cybele_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26496 mb-10  size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation with semi-custom cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cybele_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-goes-low-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybele’s kitchen</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything in Cybele’s kitchen—old cabinets, coffee-colored backsplash, dark counters, and mismatched appliances—was ripped out, making the space an empty box ready for a fresh start. The old penny tile on the floor was removed, the subfloor was leveled, and then new flooring—faux wood porcelain tile—was installed. Walls were gutted to gain extra space for new counters and the old dark <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertop</a> was replaced with white quartz. New cabinets were installed, including taller upper cabinets with crown molding, and some of the lower cabinets were removed to make room for a dishwasher. Old backsplash tile was replaced with glossy teal subway tile and crisp white grout. The kitchen renovation thoroughly refreshed the space without any changes to the original floor plan, and new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appliances</a> included a compact microwave with a matching stainless steel shelf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26494 mb-10 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation with high-gloss cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="496" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/lisas-sweetened-upper-east-side-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa’s kitchen</a> on the Upper East Side</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lisa’s kitchen was tiny, just 54 square feet, its cabinets were too shallow to hold her servingware or pots and pans, and the drawers were too narrow. Nothing was as it should be, so the kitchen was gutted right down to the studs and subfloor. Semi-custom cabinets with a high-gloss finish and greater depth were installed, instantly improving the form and function of the space. The stained, laminate countertop was replaced with a bright, white quartz. White subway tile took the place of the old, cracked <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backsplash</a>, and a pinstripe of gray tile was added for a bit of flair. The existing appliances, which were beginning to short out and die, were substituted with a new dishwasher, counter-depth refrigerator, range, and microwave. The new look is clean and minimal—exactly what Lisa had in mind when she set out to upgrade her kitchen.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26169 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living and dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="custom kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Giving new life to an estate-condition kitchen and living room in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier had already lived in New York City as renters for several years when they made the decision to make the Big Apple their long-term home. This meant a move from the Upper West Side to Brooklyn, which they preferred for its pace and culture. Rentals were considered but ultimately rejected because of their notoriously small kitchens; the couple loves to cook and needed enough space to work together comfortably. An updated unit in the Clinton Hill Co-ops caught their eye—but unfortunately, they were outbid. Then, having fallen in love with the CHCs (as have many other Sweeten renovators before them!), they realized they could buy one of the units that needed work and have the money to spend on a custom renovation. They made their choice based on the layouts that had space for their ideal custom kitchen. In the unit they selected, everything had to go—the dingy wallpaper and paint, bad tile, and a kitchen that hadn’t been touched in decades. The only thing that would remain were the floors, which would be sanded and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a>. They decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> for the job after posting their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier achieved the “modern industrial, open-concept feel” they were looking for by demolishing the walls between the old pantry, living room, dining room, and kitchen. “We wanted a lighter feeling in the apartment, given that the ceiling is not particularly high,” Natalie explained. With less obstruction, the custom kitchen was brightened by the windows in the dining nook and spacious enough for the pair to host dinner parties. They also added plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> for storing all of their kitchen equipment. The sink and dishwasher moved to the wall perpendicular to the stove, allowing their Sweeten contractor to increase counter space and improve the custom kitchen’s overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flow</a>. The addition of a built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spice drawer</a> and cabinets with pull-out drawers meant that there was a designated spot for their kitchen goods—from small appliances to pots and pans. With many moving parts, Natalie and Cartier relied on Christina, their Sweeten Planner, to help stay on top of their renovation in real time throughout their home&#8217;s transformation. They even received a comprehensive digital record documenting their three-month renovation at completion.</p>

</a>Guest post by Nancy in her Upper East Side studio apartment</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Nancy&#8217;s first New York City apartment was a long time in the making—35 years to be exact. She searched for a dream home in Manhattan where she could apply the movie set design playing in her mind, but none of the spaces felt right. So Nancy, who works in human resources, took matters into her own hands and purchased a 550-square-foot studio apartment on the Upper East Side that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s. Everything required an overhaul! To bring her vision to life, she made smart sacrifices in her narrow 6-foot-wide kitchen, turned a closet into a walk-in dressing room, and used wallpaper to carve out separate areas. You&#8217;ll want to read Nancy&#8217;s renovation journey.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;ve lived in the city my whole life and have spent the last 35 years mentally cataloging my favorite buildings, blocks, and parts of the city. When I decided to buy my first place a few years ago, I was living in Chelsea—and loved it—but knew I need to shift my search further uptown to get more for my budget. I had always gravitated towards the Upper East Side and gone to open houses on and off over the years. If there&#8217;s an elevator, doorman building without in-window air conditioning units (my only real deal-breaker) in the East 70s, I&#8217;ve probably been there at some point. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The first apartment I saw on my search was in the same line I’m currently living in but on a lower floor. The apartment had been redone in a style that was fine but not my own, and the alcove was turned into a narrow bedroom cut off from heat and air conditioning. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Fast forward a few months and I&#8217;d been turned off by so many similar “I could live with it, I guess” renovations that I was determined to buy a place that would require a lot of work, knowing I might need to sacrifice space for the ability to make my place my own. I had loved the location, building, and low maintenance costs of that first place I&#8217;d seen months ago and found a studio apartment on StreetEasy that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s, except for some new appliances–score! An offer was made, and I set out to renovate before moving in. I was excited that EVERYTHING required a refresh. My apartment is a decent-sized alcove studio—about 550 square feet—in a postwar Upper East Side high-rise. Since moving in, I&#8217;ve welcomed a fluffy new roommate named Hudson, who enjoys spending his days on the couch. We&#8217;re still working on getting him to embrace his dog bed.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I had heard about Sweeten from a few places—</span><span class="s1"><i>New York </i></span><span class="s1">magazine, Curbed, and even from a colleague who knew the founder—so it was the first place I turned to when looking for a contractor. I met with a few matches and had a ton of questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*What would this cost (or rather, can I do all this with what I want to spend)? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How long would it take? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How easy is it to get all my plans approved by my co-op board and the city? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d been dreaming of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this project</a> since I first discovered HGTV and had a pretty clear vision of what I had in mind: </span><span class="s1">a light and airy space&#8230;a dreamy beach house vibe that a character in a Nancy Meyers movie was tragically forced to squeeze into a tiny New York studio apartment (the “It’s Complicated” kitchen will have to wait). </span><span class="s1"> That said, I knew I needed a lot of help executing that vision and managing all of the pieces of a renovation that don&#8217;t find their way onto a Pinterest board. My Sweeten contractor was great at figuring out the best way to rewire the space, upgrade the electric panel, add in a ceiling light in the living space, inject new life to the parquet floors, and bring the plumbing up to standard.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">My contractor and I spent a ton of time playing with the footprint. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Ultimately, we decided to keep the footprint as-is, but widen the kitchen entrance that led into the living space, reconfigure the walk-in closet to be more user-friendly with french doors, and turn the cramped sleeping area closets into an open dressing room. I was always excited about the storage in the apartment, but now it&#8217;s much more efficient. Everything is put away in its own place and the storage blends into the look of the space.  </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The other big question was the kitchen layout. I dragged my mom—fresh off two of her own major kitchen renovations—to IKEA on multiple occasions to work out a footprint that would achieve two things in the small space: provide as much drawer storage as possible and add a dishwasher. After one particularly insane mock-up where I had almost convinced myself I could turn the 6-foot-wide space into a galley kitchen with a dishwasher drawer stacked over an oven (must have been Swedish meatball-induced temporary insanity), we realized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> were the way to go. Surprisingly, Home Depot came through with their Innermost collection where each piece could be semi-customized to bring the cabinets to the ceiling and turn a corner into usable space. I love that I was able to fit a shallow utensil drawer below the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a>. Choosing to forego the standard oven range was probably my most &#8216;controversial&#8217; decision—I really wanted that dishwasher—but I&#8217;ve come to love the induction top that fits into the countertop. The combo microwave/convection oven is perfect for my needs—it cooks just as well as most of the tiny apartment ovens and frees up a ton of space.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The rest of the decisions were mostly a balance between putting my stamp on the place and keeping resale in mind. I decided to go more traditional with the permanent kitchen and bath fixtures, but have more fun with the wallpaper, fabrics, lighting, and other decorative items. Using the Tanzania wallpaper print in the entryway helped define the space and kept with the black-and-white color palette. When I decided to keep the studio apartment as an open plan, I still wanted to keep the bedroom area defined as its own and the wallpaper from Flat Vernacular—which I’m in love with—does that well. It also keeps with the light feeling of the space. My contractor suggested molding with clean profiles—it&#8217;s actually just lumber—that works perfectly with the simple baseboards. I love the detail on the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doors</a> that have a simple style but give a bit of interest around the casing, which also helps relieve any warping with time. The floors were sanded down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refinished</a> in a matte gray tone.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The cramped, shallow bathtub was replaced with a large shower, making the space feel more open and so much more functional—perfect for containing Hudson’s bathtime messes. The deep <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage cabinet</a> above the toilet was one of the few things I&#8217;d probably do differently as it was a gaffe on my part. I ordered the cabinet without paying attention to how far out it would protrude—it&#8217;s 10-inches deep—and was installed with tile around it before I realized. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but using a shallow medicine cabinet would have been a better choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As with any reno, there were some hiccups along the way with permits taking a long time to come through and building regulations stopping work for any and all holidays. The 60-year-old pipes burst downstairs onto some very understanding neighbors, and then from above onto my freshly renovated space about a week after everything was done! </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweeten was a great partner along the way. Once I posted my project, they helped me figure out what I could do with my budget and asked the right questions so I could evaluate the bids I received. </span><span class="s1">They were a great sounding board when faced with questions during the process, such as delays and increased costs. I definitely recommend any renovator to use the Sweeten team to understand all the moving pieces throughout the process. Having lived in my space for some time now, I love it, and there isn&#8217;t much I would do differently. I am getting the bug to renovate and decorate a new space. So who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll be calling Sweeten again soon with a new space to refresh!</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald had a dream: he wanted to live in a loft apartment. His current home, a 1,800-square-foot house in Elmhurst, was definitely <em>not</em> a loft, but it was ideal for him and his wife in many other ways. It was close to both of their jobs, as well as to both sets of parents, and they loved having a backyard right off the kitchen. So they decided to do the next best thing: make their home as &#8220;loft-like&#8221; as a house could be, most notably opening </span><span class="s1">up walls so the space would have an airy feel. Finally, it came time to tackle the tight, closed-off kitchen. Here are the details on a long-awaited kitchen renovation (and a few extras!) befitting two avid cooks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23870 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23862 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23860 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23865" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After living in his home for close to ten years, Romuald knew that a new kitchen could dramatically change how his family used the space. He and his wife love cooking together, so they wanted to create a new kitchen in which two (or more!) people could comfortably work. Upon his wife&#8217;s recommendation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">turned to Sweeten</span></a> for help and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his <span class="s2">contractor</span></a> for the project. The original kitchen featured dark wood cabinets and felt cave-like because of a wall separating it from the main living space. Wanting to demolish the wall, it was necessary to regain the storage space by adding an island. It also afforded an extra work surface and an unobstructed sightline across the whole first floor of the house for a loft apartment feel. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Working with their contractor, the couple came up with a plan for their new kitchen. The original flooring was a tile that contrasted with the hardwood running through the rest of the first floor. They wanted to continue the wood look but opted for a gray “wood” porcelain that would be much easier to maintain (important for a kitchen that sees a lot of action!). <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-custom cabinets</a> made it possible for creative storage solutions like an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; (details below) to be incorporated into the kitchen plan. The warm gray cabinets they chose from <a href="https://www.waypointlivingspaces.com/cabinets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Waypoint</span></a> coordinated with the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>. A white quartz countertop and classic marble subway tile for the backsplash brought a clean yet contrasting look. Above the stove, they installed a pot-filler to save the job of hauling a heavy pot of water from the sink on the island to the stovetop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23866 mb-0 size-chrono" title="microwave" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" alt="microwave" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald and his wife started shopping around to replace all of their appliances with the exception of their investment appliance—a <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Thermador</span></a> range with blue knobs. After visiting appliance stores and making product choices,  he came across one of his favorite finds—the microwave drawer! A built-in microwave was placed high on their wish list so that it wouldn’t take up valuable counter space like their previous one did. When he came across the drawer, he knew that it was the way to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Next, their Sweeten contractor suggested the genius solution of an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221;—a much-loved-but-seldom-seen feature in city apartments. This storage unit would house their toaster, coffeemaker, as well as a few odds and ends, with outlets built into the back keeping a tangle of cords contained. With the “garage door” lowered, the counters would look instantly cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In the spot where a dividing wall originally stood, they installed an island. While they had intended to build one about six feet long, it ultimately expanded to a 10-foot-long island—a decision that Romuald doesn’t regret one bit. “We can fit four stools along one side, while the other side has enough space for our farmhouse sink, microwave drawer, and dishwasher—and with storage room, too!” Given the space now has the open feel of a loft apartment, they can now watch the TV in their living room from the kitchen. Romuald explains, “We have it on a swivel, so we just swing it around and can cook and watch TV at the same time. This is great for unwinding after a long day’s work.” They also love the way that the breeze flows through the entire space when they open the door to the backyard—something that wasn’t possible with walls in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23861 mb-24 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While the project took a bit longer than anticipated due to delays in delivery of materials, Romuald reports that they are very happy with the way it all turned out. And although they had intended on just renovating the kitchen, the project expanded in the end to include new floors throughout the entire living space, as well as a new railing for the stairs leading to the second floor of their house. All of these changes have made their house a dream home for the couple!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Romuald for sharing your new, loft-like space with us!</i></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Here’s a primer on kitchen cabinets, from custom designs to stock options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinet construction may well end up being the&nbsp;single biggest expense of your entire renovation, and the results are the most obvious visual proof of your investment, so this can feel like a heavy decision. The challenge (and opportunity) is that your choices are endless, but if you focus on a few key factors, you can find the right cabinets for your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
IKEA cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to assume that your budget is the only consideration and while it’s true that custom cabinets can be (much, much) more expensive than stock cabinets, they don’t have to be.&nbsp;Even the cheapest kitchen is an enormous investment, so if budget isn’t necessarily the deciding factor, how should you decide and how can you keep your budget from dictating your choices? First, a few definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color=""></a></p>
<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.</p>
<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href="https://bulthaup.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulthaup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000</strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.</p>

Custom cabinets by Henrybuilt in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi and David&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1/2” particle board will not last as long as 3/4” or 1” furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Once you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you’re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options – for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>

<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times. If you’re gearing up for a renovation in the next two months, you can get your hands on pre-fab cabinets in-store on a same-day basis, or delivered within two or three weeks. And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable. Many homeowners go with custom cabinets because they think they want options and then end up feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Many clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine. Shops like ours provide personalized&nbsp;design as part of the overall service to build features for individual clients.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a></i></p>
<h3>Still having trouble deciding? Go for a&nbsp;hybrid!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces can lower your cost without compromising on quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces allows for lower cost and uniqueness. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kokeena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kokeena</a>&nbsp;make door and drawer faces for stock cabinets so you’re not limited to IKEA’s palette. In addition, there are endless options for shelving, countertops, and cabinet pulls&nbsp;allowing for individuality while using inexpensive pre-fab cabinets.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a></i></p>

For more modern kitchens, a matte-finish knob or pull is an easy way to customize cabinets. Repainting with a calming neutral or a bold jewel tone can refresh a kitchen without requiring demolition.</p> </div> </div>
