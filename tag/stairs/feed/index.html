</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Opening up a claustrophobic layout</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Be patient and be bold,” Can Vu Bui, a Brooklyn principal at <a href="https://oo-t.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Things</a>, a collaborative architecture and design studio, likes to tell his clients. This was his mantra going into the main floor gut renovation of an Art Deco–era rowhouse in Glendale, Queens. Bui’s slow, steady approach led to a striking result.</span></p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h5></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners had been living in the home when they hired Bui, and were ready for dramatic change on the brick building’s first floor. They planned on revising the existing layout to bring air and light to a chronically dreary space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After coming up with a concept reflecting light modernism,</span><span class="s1"> Bui created a project plan and posted the job on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our website</a>. They worked with the homeowner to review bids and portfolios before hiring a contracting firm in Queens.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Starting out, the team had their work cut out for them. “The house’s primary problem was a direct product of its 1920s design,” the architect said. The brick-and-mortar building, surrounded by townhomes, had a narrow, chopped-up floor plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenges of opening the 600-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main floor space</a>, according to Bui, were abundant. A load-bearing masonry wall blocked light from reaching the living and dining rooms. Walls that separated the stair, kitchen, and dining area inhibited flow, creating “small, claustrophobic” spaces, he said.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">“We designed custom millwork that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench.”</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51433 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg" alt="Image of the family room with black couch and arched entry to dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-51441 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated dining room with view of stairway and built in storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Art Deco-approved arches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The light and space problems at the top of Bui’s task list were only the beginning. “This project presented an opportunity to fix those pragmatic issues,” he said, but also to pull together and “artfully unify” the divided ground floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Door frames and wall openings were inconsistent, but the building held some inspiring original details. Fortunately, a few with gently rounded upper corners caught the architect’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bui envisioned sloping designs to link the spaces together. “We replaced existing walls with elegant structural arches,” the architect said. “The rooms open generously into each other, allowing light to pour into the home’s interior.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Stairs open up with storage</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the desire for openness and light, maximum storage space was still needed for functionality and day-to-day life, particularly in New York City homes, according to Bui. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to his plan, the general contractor opened the wall between the existing stair and dining room, removing a large, square center section. Next, the contracting team revised the staircase, adding a landing a few steps from the base and then introducing a turn, so that the last few steps led into the dining room. The changes helped the narrow stairs and small dining room feel instantly less claustrophobic.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51449 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg" alt="Image of built-in storage with drawers and cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the breaking through of the wall eliminated key storage space. Bui found a fix. “We designed <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom millwork</a>” surrounding the new wall opening, he says, “that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench,” as well as custom handrails. In the end, a partially exposed stairway brings light and drama to the home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paint colors and bright finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls and the interior planes of the arches are painted in muted shades—green, ochre, and blue. Curved millwork is also seen on a full wall of open storage in the dining room. The brushed oak is stained with a hint of gold. Brass accents bring warmth to the rooms.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51442 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="Image of a newly renovated kitchen with checkerboard floor and green walls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51444 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated galley kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Many homeowners and designers fear color,” he said. “It makes sense—you don’t want to be stuck with the wrong one.” The architectural team worked closely with the homeowner throughout the process, providing renderings, tests, and mockups to prevent surprises. For instance, the shade of gold on the walls in the foyer and dining room carefully bookends the space without overwhelming or darkening the area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The pale <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green in the kitchen</a> and reading nook plays homage to classical French country homes,” Bui said. The effect is an inviting color path leading one through the house. “Our goal,” Bui said, “is to let color boldly elevate the feeling of a space.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architect + Sweeten general contractor = Teamwork heaven</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the process, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and Sweeten general contractor</a> worked together closely, executing Bui’s vision. “As architects, we spend a lot of time designing custom details—our relationships with the contractors who can make them are critical. It’s great to work with craftspeople who bring insight and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertise to the project</a>.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, Bui explained, the renovation made over the once spiritless space—it feels bright and modern, but not harsh or humorless. Furthermore, color and flow now have a direct impact on the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comfort one feels in their surroundings</a>. “This is a home, after all,” Bui said. “It should feel special.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A renovation gives a design-obsessed owner the ultimate pad</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>For a lot of singles in New York City, a 500-square-foot Greenwich Village studio with both a lofted bedroom and an outdoor balcony would sound like a pie-in-the-sky find. But new homeowner Carly Schulte had a higher vision for this downtown co-op—she knew when she saw it that she could improve on it. She snapped up the apartment and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors. Here’s how Carly literally raised the lofty studio’s roof, with a Sweeten general contractor, making it a party-friendly place that feels larger than it really is.</i></span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I was lucky in the apartment hunt. I’d only been to a handful of showings, but when I saw this place, I knew I wanted to make an offer. I have a soft spot for lofts, and the balcony made it a must-have. I’d been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning—and saving—to buy</a> an apartment for years, and it was a good thing I waited. The sellers were motivated. I put in a bid and pulled off the purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d envisioned an overhaul that included renovating the kitchen and bathroom, modernizing the loft and stairs, and adding a giant wall-to-wall built-in of shelves and closets in the living room,</span><span class="s1"> but it was once I was there that I clarified my goals. I realized I wanted to expand the kitchen, since I love to cook; I needed a larger kitchen peninsula that would serve as both a work and eating surface. </span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Although I left things like cabinet dimensions and stair specs to the professionals, I selected all the flooring, cabinets, [and other finishes].</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It dawned on me, too, that I wanted to raise the ceiling. One of the apartment’s previous owners had actually <i>dropped</i> it by at least five feet, wasting space and blocking light. In my mind, high ceilings are pretty much universally beloved and will definitely add value when I ultimately go to sell the apartment. I saw that by reclaiming the height, I could enclose the sleeping loft, allowing it to feel private but still be bright. I designed the windowed loft wall by looking through Instagram and showing the drawings to my Sweeten contractor. He found a way to make the enclosure with sliding glass panels that transmit both air and light.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I knew when I hired my contractor that I wanted to work this way, doing my own design work, and I was happy to find a contractor who would work with me. To say I was hands-on would be an understatement. Although I left cabinet and stair specs to the professionals, I handled most of the materials including the cabinets, tile, and appliances, as well as the layouts for each room (which was surprisingly time-consuming). </span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When it came to aesthetics, I stayed neutral, particularly in more permanent elements like flooring and cabinetry. But I have a huge interest in texture, and I was excited about mixing flat, modern, cool elements, such as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/stairs-that-are-a-real-design-treat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steel staircase</a> and black cabinetry [a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45662050/image/45662053/Deep-Dark">great way to create depth</a>], with warmer ones, like the wood-grain floors and golden-brown leather and upholstery. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To achieve the look I wanted, we had to do the work. It was a challenge, with bumps. The worst came early, when we demolished the kitchen and found asbestos. Remediation cost about $6,000 and added three months to the timeline. I would strongly recommend asbestos testing during the diligence phase to any potential buyer. Had I tested up-front and knocked some of the abatement costs off of the purchase price, I would have saved money.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">From start to finish, excluding the asbestos work, my renovation spanned five months. I moved out for several weeks when the contractor knocked down walls and raised the ceiling. For much of it, though, I was there. I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases and boxes. Luckily, my bedroom remained mostly untouched, so once the enclosure was finished, I spent my home time up there. I don’t regret slumming it. The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I heavily underestimated how long the approval process would take. The time it took just to obtain the co-op board’s approval for my plan was nearly six months. Staying in my rental apartment in hopes of a fast renovation was a big mistake. If I had it to do again, I would move in right after closing, live in my new space, and use that rent money for something meaningful. Hindsight is 20/20!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">People have asked how I lived through the project. I think I blocked some of it out, but I do remember leaning on the Sweeten team after a few long construction delays made me feel frustrated and uncertain. They offered me a sounding board and helped me adjust my expectations, and as a first-time renovator struggling to parse out the delays, their guidance was immensely helpful. When needed, Sweeten contacted my contractor and helped to keep things moving smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Despite the difficulties, I love the way the place turned out. The raised ceiling, now about 16 feet high, changed the entire feel of the place. The library ladder, a functional addition facilitating access to the high cupboards, added a fun touch, and the loft enclosure made the bedroom feel cozy and intimate. My new kitchen has made cooking every meal a pleasure, and even the bathroom is beautiful, which is rare to say about a bathroom. There was stress and sweat, sure. But designing the space was one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever worked on.</span></p>
