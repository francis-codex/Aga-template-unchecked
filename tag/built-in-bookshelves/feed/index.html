<h2>No space? No problem! Get inspired by these small entryway ideas by Sweeten</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it: the entryway is the first space—and the last—everyone sees in your home. It&#8217;s a perfect space for making a statement, and it deserves a careful balance of form and function. Regardless of your usable square footage, there are great options for style and utility improvements in even the smallest of entryways. Here, we highlight 5 design-forward small entryway ideas by Sweeten contractors.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 1: Enlarge a small entryway area</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39880" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For an 1,800-square-foot apartment in Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side, a couple hired architect Jessica Wetters to help reimagine the space. It was a full-gut renovation of the kitchen, master bedroom, living area, and bathroom, as well as <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/"><span class="s2">the entry area.</span></a> The entry was a relatively simple job, since they were gutting the rest of the house, but it brought outsized benefits: a great first impression, an enlarged space to fit a comfortable bench, and a floating shelf for essentials.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Laura and Randy put an offer on their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/"><span class="s2">Upper East Side co-op</span></a>, they envisioned an all-new, more functional layout. Central to the plan was the small entryway. &#8220;We knew we wanted to extend the entryway as it was incredibly narrow with two closets on either side of the front door,&#8221; Laura said. &#8220;We decided to keep the larger walk-in and remove the smaller one, to create a place that was pretty but also functional.&#8221; The couple completed the statement with stunning, geometric-patterned wallpaper</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 2: Use wallpaper to make a statement</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43738" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg" alt="wallpaper foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jessica and Alex had rented for six years before buying an <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/"><span class="s2">800-square-foot co-op</span></a> in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Although they were thrilled to finally own a home, they knew the apartment would need work before feeling like their home. They remodeled the galley kitchen and the bathroom and reconfigured a few closets. They also gave the entryway some attention, with carefully chosen wallpaper to make a visual statement. &#8220;The subtle raffia gives texture and depth to the walls,&#8221; said Jessica. &#8220;We chose materials that would stand the test of time from both an aesthetic and durability standpoint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For media executive Jenifer Herrmann and her partner Mitzie Wong (co-founder of creative design firm <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/"><span class="s2">Roar + Rabbit),</span></a> wallpaper was likewise the way to make a statement in their newly renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/"><span class="s2">entryway.</span></a> They added Rhye wallpaper in hand foil and completed the look with a round mirror from <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com/"><span class="s2">Serena &amp; Lily </span></a>and a console from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/"><span class="s2">West Elm—</span></a>elements that complemented their nature theme.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 3: Combine function + design accents</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41693" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40969" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tina, a designer, and her husband Andrew wished they had entryway storage for shoes and coats. When they planned a complete renovation of their  <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/"><span class="s2">1930s co-op</span></a> in Sunnyside, New York, they had to contend with tight space constraints in the entryway. Since they couldn&#8217;t enlarge the space, they used their imaginations to maximize the space, combining form with function. They added a small bench, along with hooks for bags and coats, all set against a shiplap background. &#8220;We love the clean lines and texture of details of the shiplap,&#8221; said Tina.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Erin and Chris, their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/"><span class="s2">three-bedroom, two-bath co-op</span></a> in a post-war, 1950s building also lacked storage at the entry. To remedy, they installed a bench with storage bins underneath and overhead. For finishing touches they added wicker baskets, a floating shelf, and a metal-framed mirror to the adjacent wall</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 4: Add a statement piece</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After renting for many years, John wanted to start building equity. He bought a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/murray-hill-full-apartment-renovation/"><span class="s2">1,200-square-foot apartment</span></a> on Park Avenue in New York City, with gorgeous views of the skyline. He enlisted architect <a href="https://aurorafarewell.com/"><span class="s2">Aurora Farewell</span></a> to help improve the layout and add professional touches, to make the space feel cohesive and thoughtfully designed. For the entryway, he wanted a sense of drama. He and the architect chose a large round mirror to cover most of the wall, above a minimalistic, multifunction wood bench</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 5: Make the entryway space do double duty</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/">Chris and Jeremy</a></span><span class="s2"> had hoped to renovate sometime in the distant future. Then, water damage from a leaky apartment above required immediate attention, inspiring them to go beyond repairs and jump into a larger renovation. In addition to the bathroom, they remodeled their kitchen and living areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They also knew the foyer presented an interesting opportunity. It was large enough to feel like wasted spaces if they left it empty, but too small for any obvious uses. Their Sweeten general contractor helped them find an imaginative solution. &#8220;We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8-inches deep. It holds loads more than we expected,&#8221; said Jeremy. &#8220;On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar.&#8221; Art lights hang over tall mirrors, giving a classic gallery sensibility</span>.</p>
