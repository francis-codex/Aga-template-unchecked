<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refinish a basement in Ardmore, Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When David and Wendy bought their 2,700-square-foot home in a Philadelphia suburb, one thing was for sure: the smelly, dated basement had to go. David completely demoed it with every intention of refinishing it after they moved in. Two years later and the basement had become a storage room instead of the recreational space for “serious TV watching,” an exercise area, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/">bar</a> that he’d hoped to create. &#8220;I never got around to it, though, and finally hired someone through Sweeten,&#8221; David said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Ready to take on the unfinished basement once and for all, David <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> on Sweeten and chose this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Since he’d already completed the demolition, they hit the ground running and kept his main goal of having a &#8220;dedicated space for TV-watching where [he] didn&#8217;t have to worry about large speakers ruining the decor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they had to determine how to best lay out the basement to meet his multi-purpose needs. A cousin who owns the interior design firm <a href="https://lkdesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LK Design</a> helped David figure out where to position the bar, fitness equipment, and the entertainment seating. Coming down the stairs from the main floor, the exercise area was set up directly to the right and away from the main living space. The bar and mini kitchen open conveniently to the seating area for easy access. Low ductwork presented a great spot to place the cabinetry and sink, and to maximize headspace as much as possible, they placed the bar directly under an exposed steel beam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for finishing touches, they outfitted the theater with plush carpeting for optimal comfort. For the remainder of the flooring, David decided on more durable (plus pet- and kid-friendly!) vinyl plank. The kitchen and bar got a luxe touch with granite <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>, gray cabinets, and chrome hardware.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35322 noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35316 noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-area-granite-countertop" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48564 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg" alt="Kitchen area with sink under grantite countertop and gray cabinetry after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Overall the biggest challenge (aside from determining the layout) was getting the bar sink installed below the sewer line. Fortunately, a plumber found a solution and installed a pump. Their Sweeten general contractor also provided invaluable assistance getting a full-size refrigerator down the narrow staircase, not to mention handling a few issues with vendors and navigating delays. &#8220;We had gas lines in the way of the ceiling, and he had a plumber who was able to reroute the lines in a very cost-effective way. Previous plumbers I had found only suggested much more expensive solutions,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thinking ahead, they also prepared for possible wiring needs down the line and “future-proofed” throughout the basement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does the family feel about their new hangout space? &#8220;Comfortable and relaxed,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="low-white-ceiling-blue-walls" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48569 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Low white ceiling with blue walls in the entertainment room and fitness equipment after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: David and the contractor installed built-in cabinets in the corners of the entertaining area to hide the gas meters.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Carpeting: <a href="https://www.mohawkflooring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohawk</a>. Lifeproof vinyl plank flooring: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Cabinets, cabinet fronts, faucet: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikea</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristiana and her husband</a> took advantage of valuable square footage and turned their basement into a multi-purpose space complete with a family room, wine storage, and laundry area.</p>
