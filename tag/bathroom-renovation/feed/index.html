			<h2>What to know about bathroom remodeling in Washington DC from costs and permits to ventilation</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi.jpg" alt="Washington DC bathroom" width="1000" height="714" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi-600x428.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Washington DC has limitless possibilities that make it one of the most exciting places to live in the U.S. If you are considering bathroom remodeling in Washington DC, you may find a parallel set of challenges and possibilities for your project. Not to worry: here we outline what to know before you renovate a bathroom in the DC area.</span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s2">Defining the area around Washington DC</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC first means hammering down its geography. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">The commonly held notion is that DC consists of the District, Southern Maryland, and Northern Virginia. Sweeten currently services </span><span class="s3">the DC area, Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland, and select counties in Virginia, including Fairfax and Arlington.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Exterior architecture</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Part of what makes the DC area so appealing is its architecturally significant buildings. Many older and noteworthy buildings are within the District, specifically Georgetown, Capitol Hill, Adams Morgan, and Dupont. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Southern Maryland and Northern Virginia do have some historically important buildings, </span><span class="s4">but not to the extent that the District does.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s2">In the District, Preservation Reviews by the Office of Planning tend to concentrate on exterior work. Interior alterations and non-structural interior demolition are both permitted activities but are exempt from Preservation Reviews.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Renovation bathroom costs in Washington DC</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The cost of remodeling a high-end bathroom in the South Atlantic region, which includes the DC metro area, is higher than the national average. Starting costs for a low-end bathroom remodel is $16,500. A mid-range budget starts at around $26,000. A high-end remodel starts at $38,000 for a 4– or 5–piece bath. (You can read more in Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-washington-dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom remodeling cost guide for Washington DC</a>). Contractors will be able to provide you with more detailed estimates after a site visit. It&#8217;s also important to meet with licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/washington-dc-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Washington DC</a> with local experience who are up-to-date on codes and regulations. </span></p>
<h4>&#8220;Rip-and-replace&#8221; bathroom remodels in older homes</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">A “rip-and-replace” bathroom remodel will always save you money over a full remodel. Like the name says, fixtures are pulled out and replaced. The footprint does not change, nor does the drywall, subfloor, pipes, or wiring. In a “rip-and-replace,” the most expensive items are the toilet, tub or shower, faucet, sink, and cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">But there is a catch: Washington <span class="s2">DC</span> has a significantly older housing stock. East of the Capitol, north of the K Street business district, up Georgia Avenue, and on either side of the 16th Street corridor, houses can be 100 years old or more. This means that a “rip-and-replace” remodel is usually not possible if the bathroom is in its original state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Bathroom remodels for these older homes usually require a full gutting to expose the insides of the walls, including pipes and wiring. Knob-and-tube wiring, common in these homes, must be replaced with modern non-metallic wiring. Additionally, the service panel should be updated. When the studs are bowed or broken, they can be sistered with a parallel stud to the side. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Many of these older <span class="s2">DC</span> homes were solidly built with materials considered premium for their time. Common materials that <span class="s2">DC</span> homeowners will encounter are cast iron tubs, two-by-fours that actually measure 2 inches by 4 inches, heavy joists, and linoleum. These items can be difficult to remove. For example, homeowners removing cast-iron tubs will need to break or cut them apart on-site to assist with removal.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">The effect of climate in DC </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The DC area can get hot—<em>really</em> hot. While DC&#8217;s spring weather is pleasant, the summer climate turns quickly—with record temperatures over 100 F and averages in the 80s. DC’s high humidity keeps everything wet, especially moisture-prone bathrooms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Explore with a general contractor the full range of measures to keep condensation in the bathroom at bay:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Adequate bathroom exhaust fan<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Openable window, if possible<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Dehumidifier<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Heated flooring<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Wall heater<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Mold-resistant paint<br />
</span></li>
<li>Install a moisture-resistant ceiling</li>
<li>Use moisture-resistant materials such as waterproof drywall or ceramic tiles</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Permits for Washington DC remodels</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bathroom remodeling permits are required in the District, Montgomery County, and Fairfax County.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">District: An Alteration and Repair Permit from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) is required. You must submit architectural plans. Since your bathroom remodel will likely be under the Department’s 1,000-square-foot cut-off, you can have your bathroom remodel project fast-tracked with a counter review.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Montgomery County: The Department of Permitting Services will require a Residental Alteration permit. You may need additional electrical and mechanical permits, too.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Fairfax County: Land Development Services requires a permit for interior alterations, as well as for individual projects related to bathroom remodeling such as installing new plumbing fixtures.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Building approvals</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC proper generally will be more involved than in the suburbs due to the larger number of condos and other board-controlled buildings. Within DC, this will be less of an issue as you move northward to Tenleytown, Petworth, Chevy Chase, and Takoma since more single-family residences are located there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Even though you own everything within the walls of the condo, condo boards typically require that you submit alteration plans for approval or attend meetings to discuss your proposal. Bathroom remodels are of special interest since these projects touch on critical services such as electrical and plumbing that affect other units. Logistics like parking for workers, elevator usage, and demolition removal must be considered.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Condo boards each have their own personalities and requirements. Board approval can be tricky. But if you are working with an experienced general contractor for the bathroom remodel, they will help you navigate the approval process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC? Now is the time.</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Don&#8217;t let the possible challenges of remodeling a DC bathroom stop you. There are clear benefits of remodeling to consider; like creative exploration, personal enjoyment, and higher resale value. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3>Starting a renovation</h3>
<p>Angela, an epidemiologist, moved to Manhattan from New Jersey and started renting. She loved the city so much, she decided to make it her home. She chose to live at The Manor, a 1928 landmark building in the East 40s, for its grand lobby and beautiful casement windows that overlook a neighborhood park and provide natural light. The only thing due for an update? The co-op’s outdated, flawed bathroom.</p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45761" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A designer brings ideas for an old bathroom</h3>
<p>She lived in her apartment for several years, doing research and planning before embarking on a renovation. She discovered Sweeten around the same time she found an image of a similar bathroom done by interior designer <a href="https://vonbinteriors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrea Brodfuehrer</a>. “Everything just came together,” Angela said, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted her project</a> on Sweeten.</p>
<p>The bathroom wasn&#8217;t in great shape. It had broken tiles, visible pipes, and water shut-off valves near the sink, plus poorly placed ceramic fixtures; like a toilet paper holder installed on the tile wall that was uncomfortably close to the toilet. The outdated bathroom needed storage solutions that worked better than the existing storage areas (the floor, ledges, or open shelving behind the bathroom door.)</p>
<p>Though she knew what she wanted, Angela said, “I barely knew where to start. Seeing <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts like the ones on Sweeten</a> gave me some insight into the process and helped motivate me to take the plunge with the renovation.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="bathroom sink faucet" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45751" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A glamorous, organized white bathroom</h3>
<p>Once she was ready to get estimates and interview contractors, Angela said, “Sweeten client services were there for me, ensuring I found [the contractor] who was the right fit for my project. It helped make the process feel a bit less daunting.” Her Sweeten general contractor was in regular communication with Angela and her designer throughout the process and was responsive to questions, comments, and tweaks along the way.</p>
<p>Stylewise, Angela wanted to keep things simple and classic yet unique. She fell in love with a Kelly Wearstler <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> that Andrea had shown her and admitted it was her favorite part of the bathroom. By contrast, since the floor tile was bold, she chose a white subway tile for the walls with light gray grout for balance.</p>
<p>Angela also included <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble niches and shelves</a>, including one next to the sink that mimicked one she had seen in one of Andrea’s previous designs. In the shower, she opted for a rain showerhead and a handheld; Andrea also suggested including a hook above the shower niche for yet another shower option.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45754" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45750" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding bathroom storage solutions</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more storage</a>, a space between the shower and the wall that housed some pipes became tucked-away shelves, perfect for towels and toiletries and a hidden toilet paper holder.</p>
<p>At first, Angela thought that a designer wasn&#8217;t necessary for such a small bathroom with no layout change. But now, she would highly recommend it. Once she met Andrea, they clicked right away. “She had amazing ideas and helped pull things together in a way I couldn&#8217;t have myself,” Angela said.</p>
<p>Overall, the project went smoothly, but Angela was surprised at how difficult it was to see the bathroom reduced to rubble. “Once the general contractor put everything back together, though, that phase of the work seemed like a distant memory,” she recalled.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45749" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Finding the right general contractor</h3>
<p>After initially meeting with a few contractors, Angela realized how important it was to nail down what she really wanted in order to ensure she got comparable estimates. It was essential to get a sense of a contractor’s personality and how well they would work together. “Our contractor made a great first impression when he braved an unusually busy day due to the Women’s March to come to see the bathroom and provide an estimate,” she said. “Renovating can be a relatively short but very intense process, so it’s important to find someone you can trust.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: Transform a one-bedroom unit by splitting the master bath into two; adding a second bathroom and an extra bedroom. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: When Jeanne and Philip found out they were having a baby, it was just the incentive they needed to renovate. Changing the layout of their 1,000-square-foot apartment would be more efficient for their growing family. They wanted more space to enjoy while raising their little one</span><span class="s2">—without being on top of one another. Luckily, with the help of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and found a contractor who could help fulfill their vision of adding a second bathroom and bedroom by splitting up the master bath. </span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01.jpg" alt="before pictures of the bathroom " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>They discussed turning their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom and splitting their master bath into two with their contractor. Luckily, there was enough square footage to play with. The previous owner had taken a closet next to the master bathroom to make a large walk-in shower. The couple&#8217;s Sweeten contractor would use some of that space to make a guest bath and second bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: The couple decided a design-build firm would be a good fit since maximizing their apartment&#8217;s limited space would be tricky. Plus, the contractor handled the</span> architectural documents required by the co-op board and filed for city permits. The family&#8217;s main goal was to turn the guest bath into an ADA-compliant space. To do so, they had to add a step up due to underlying drains. Without it, the room would not be able to function in such a capacity. An ADA-compliant space follows a federal guideline to provide greater <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access to people with limited mobility</a>.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about redoing your bathroom—whether it is a minor refresh or an extensive update—choosing the right vanity is essential. It can be a nice focal point for your design as well as a functional item that will keep you organized.</p>
<p>We pored over some of the bathroom renovations done by contractors in <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>&#8216;s network, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and found some common motifs—designs that keep coming up in recent bath transformations. Here is a look at some of the classic vanity styles that might inspire you as you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor/">plan your next renovation</a>.</p>

<p>Similar to exposed plumbing vanities in the fact that they are largely known for their space-saving qualities, pedestal vanities are making a resurgence, or so many believe. However, we would argue they never really went away. They have always been a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party/">classic option</a> when it comes to updating a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/plumbing-changes-bathroom-renovation/">square-foot-challenged bathroom</a>. They come in a range of designs—from contemporary to traditional—allowing them to blend into many different design environments.</p>

<p>When you are thinking about a bathroom model, one of the main ways to ensure that your new space will work for you is to consider how to reconfigure the layout to maximize space and storage as well as to make it suit your lifestyle. This is an opportunity to get clever and rethink the traditional vanity format.</p>
<p>For example, in one of the bathroom renovations featured above, you will notice that there is room for two sinks but the homeowners elected to install only one in favor more counter space—an unconventional decision but one that worked for them. In another renovation below, you will see the sink is placed in the corner with a long narrow &#8220;runway&#8221; countertop running along the wall, yet another example of out-of-the-box thinking.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pied-a-terre-renovation-jackson-heights-queens/">exposed plumbing</a> trend probably started as a way to save space in small bathrooms but is now a design statement. These out-in-the-open water and waste traps come in two basic types: the European P-trap and the standard U-pipe, both named for their shapes. While there are usually only these two basic styles, sink traps do come in all different finishes to suit your design aesthetic: chrome, brass, oil-rubbed, copper, stainless steel, brushed nickel, among others. Plumbing has never looked so good!</p>

<p>It might not be the first thing you think about when deciding on a vanity for your bathroom but your choice of an undermount, vessel, or vanity top sink can drastically change the look of your space. An undermount sink is flush with the counter, giving it less chance of debris to be caught in between. A vanity top sink is just as it sounds, one placed on top of the vanity itself. It is considered a more modern-day choice but can be used effectively in any bathroom style, from rustic to contemporary. A vessel sink is usually (but not always) exposed on all sides and sits atop the vanity. It is more sculptural in appearance and doesn&#8217;t have faucet holes, making it necessary to mount the fixtures on the wall or counter.</p>

<p>White goes with everything. Basically, you can&#8217;t go wrong with a white vanity. But don&#8217;t be mistaken, not all white vanities are created equal. There are so many styles to choose from—from classic two-drawers, one-cabinet configurations to two long drawers with open storage space underneath. But to truly make a white vanity your own, consider the hardware you select. Do you fancy classic knobs, contemporary pulls, or none at all? Choose your favorite!</p>

<p>Wall-mounted or floating, vanities are great for so many reasons. First, they are non-traditional so always a nice option for those who like to try something different. Second, they instantly make <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/plumbing-changes-bathroom-renovation/">the space appear larger</a> and give you extra room underneath if you like to place storage bins or baskets (however, these Sweeten renovators opted for a more streamlined look). Floating vanities are also easier to clean around and provide more square footage for radiant heat. Lastly, they can be placed at any height you desire, freeing you from the confines of the standard 30&#8243; to 36&#8243; vanities.</p>

<p>Many people are enamored with double sinks—and for good reason, and really one big reason: SPACE. They provide extra &#8220;breathing room&#8221; for larger families, or just for couples who like their own space. Even though double-sink vanities often take up more counter surface,  we bet you will find the trade-off is well worth it.</p>

<li><strong>Where: </strong>Sunnyside neighborhood, Queens, New York</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation: </strong>Remodel two bathrooms and transform the basement into a dual living and utility/storage space in a 1,200-square-foot single-family home</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Gordon</i></span></p>
<h3>A new start for an old home</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home, a brick townhouse in the Sunnyside Garden Historic District, was built in 1925 in one of the first planned communities inspired by the <span class="s2">English Garden Movement </span>in the United States. This enclave in the borough of Queens was originally developed to promote green space and community while providing affordable housing to working-class folks. Tracy, a financial analyst, and I, a teacher, had been living in the neighborhood for some time when we purchased the house, a former rental that hadn’t been improved since the early ‘90s. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/">We had a lot of ideas for updating it</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We felt lucky to find a three-story home of roughly 1,200 square feet, or 400 square feet per floor. The townhouse had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that was more than enough for the two of us, our cats, Laurel and Juniper, and our dog, Ballou. We wanted to gut-renovate both baths and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul our underutilized basement</a>. If we could squeeze in maximum function on every level, the house would feel more modern and bigger.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a landmarked townhouse</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/">renovated the kitchen</a> just after buying the house four years ago. The job, a mix of DIY projects and subcontractor commissions, was successful but laborious. We were recovered and ready to tackle the next phase, but understood that <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">the difficulty of the work would exceed our own abilities</a>, as would the red tape. Because we own a landmarked building, we would have to secure not only the expected Department of Buildings paperwork but also obtain Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) permits and approvals on all work impacting the building’s exterior. We knew our general contractor would assume much of this burden, which made us feel more comfortable diving in.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead.</span></p>

<h3>Giving new life to the basement</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the whole renovation, the basement would be the larger piece, the goal was to increase the house’s usable space. Before we started, the basement was a large, unlevel room. Thanks to the old home’s process of settling, there was a two-inch difference in floor height from the walls to the room’s center. It had an outdated bathroom and poorly planned utility areas. A previous owner had installed an awkwardly placed cabinet and sink in the middle of the big room, and the washer and dryer next to the 40-year-old boiler, making laundry day a sweaty affair. The basement bathroom was dark and dank. We wanted to recreate the basement as a study, gaming/movie space, music center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/healing-home-space/">cat sanctuary</a> with storage, laundry, and a hospitable second bathroom.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42868 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg" alt="washer and dryer basement" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A Queens basement remodel to be livable</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started in the downstairs, where we first had to level the floor. We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/">The cost and challenge of doing a poured floor</a> just didn’t make it practical, and we were ultimately happy with an alternative that gave the room a similar feel at a lower cost. After losing two inches of headspace in the leveling of the floor, our Sweeten contractor suggested raising the ceiling by exposing and painting the heating pipe—easy, since they were replacing the room’s drywall, anyway. A new basement door, window, and vents for the bathroom and boiler room were installed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, they subdivided the space, creating a new living area, a storage room, and an expanded bathroom. LPC approvals, necessary for the new exterior basement door and window, as well as bathroom and laundry venting, went through smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42855 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg" alt="bathroom image after remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><em>(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; basement bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42851 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg" alt="concrete bathroom sink" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That leads me to the renovation’s second and equally important part: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/">the bathroom remodels</a>. The basement bath would get a complete gut job to remove a creepy stall shower, and an expansion to make room for a freestanding bathtub. The windowless downstairs bathroom needed to be bright and clean. We went for a spare look, choosing large wall tiles, a custom concrete sink, and a wall-hung toilet, in addition to the beautiful bathtub. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">A tub-turned-shower for the master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our upstairs bath would also be gutted and refreshed, with a glass-walled shower replacing the old tub-and-shower setup. We couldn’t make the</span><span class="s3"> 30-square-foot room bigger, </span><span class="s1">but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/">we could up its storage and functionality</a>. Upstairs, we went for a modern toilet and a compact, wall-mount sink, along with a recessed medicine cabinet, and toothbrush niche. We installed rectangular wall tiles vertically for a playful effect. Both baths got recessed lighting.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><em><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42840 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="black hexagon bathroom floor tile, clear shower doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; upstairs bathroom</span></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was finally time to finish the basement, we were excited to be able to install the shelving system ourselves; the contractor made it easy by mounting wood blocking between the wall studs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">We wanted built-ins</a>, but the wall-shelving was more cost-effective and looks great. We offset neutral surfaces with books, wood accents, and colorful velvet furnishings. One takeaway we agree on: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Don’t cheap out on hardware</a>; the difference shows as it wears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only downside, in the end, was that the price of the project came in much more than we anticipated after we had to replace the boiler and a rotted drainpipe. Once we finalized the task list, though, our Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget. Doubling our living space has had such an impact on our daily life. We don’t have a single regret!</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ashleigh and Jonathan were renting an apartment in the Financial District of Manhattan while leasing out their own house in New Jersey, when they decided they’d rather own their everyday home. The couple sold their place across the river with the intention of buying an apartment in New York City. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found a 953-square-foot studio loft in DUMBO, Brooklyn, which was originally built as a soap factory in 1904. Since the place didn’t come equipped with a laundry hook up, they’d planned to have one installed to add a washer and dryer to their bathroom. Unfortunately, the couple <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t realize what that upgrade would involve</a>. “We had no idea that this next step would necessarily require renovation, however, we fell in love with the apartment, and figured out a way to make it work,” Ashleigh shared. </span></p>

They were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who Sweeten shared was already working on another project in the same building. “That was a large factor in us deciding to go with him for the renovation,” Ashleigh said. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="brass-fitting-over-white-bathtub" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48744 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03.jpg" alt="Navy blue paint and white subway tiles and brass fittings over white bathtub after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-laundry-niche" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48742 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg" alt="White subway tiles and blue paint in bathroom and laundry niche with washer dryer after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" />From the onset, the contractor knew timing was tight—since the couple had to be out of their rental in the Financial District by a non-negotiable deadline. “Right off the bat, he told us to only consider items that were in stock and not special order so that we could avoid unnecessary delays, which definitely guided us down a somewhat limited path when selecting tile, fixtures, etc. He was also very helpful in making design suggestions, such as what direction the herringbone tile should be installed, how many recessed lights we needed, door/molding choices, etc,” Ashleigh shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner’s first decision? The unfinished wood vanity with a Carrara marble top. From there, they chose the aged brass and gunmetal fixtures, classic white subway tiles, and navy paint for the walls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once their contractor filed the necessary plumbing and electrical permits, all they could do, construction-wise, was wait. “He assured us that he was doing everything he could to make this happen and stayed in constant communication, keeping us informed on how things were progressing with our permits, as well as letting us know when he needed certain items for installation,” Ashleigh said. Once they came through, he had a month less than planned to complete the project—but all-in-all the renovation wrapped up just two days behind schedule. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn’t exactly Ashleigh and Jonathan’s first renovation—but their first with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a licensed general contractor</a>. “His experience and expertise helped guide us through the process,” Ashleigh said. Sweeten reached out during the process and offered assistance, but the couple noted they actually didn’t need any further help and that everything was moving along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We absolutely love our new bathroom. Given the limited space, it suits our needs and style perfectly. We&#8217;ve lived with and without a washer/dryer and much prefer life with one, so the fact that we could solve that problem with the apartment makes it infinitely more livable for us.” Ashleigh said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Simple touches give this condo a personalized stamp</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Brooke and Sam knew they were home when they walked into this 1,800-foot, loft-style Brooklyn condo. The three-bedroom Fort Greene apartment was modern and gave them room to grow. That was good, because by the time they’d closed on it, they had  one-week-old baby Leroy in their arms. Brooke, a digital media exec, and Sam, a tech specialist, loved the sleek two-floor space, but wanted to freshen up the kitchen and (three!) baths, and give the apartment whimsical style. While in contract, they’d <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors. Soon, they’d <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chosen their contractor</a> and had keys to the condo. Here’s how new mom Brooke took the designer’s seat and pulled off a baby-friendly redo in a flash.</i></span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We closed on our home one week after I gave birth to our daughter. </span><span class="s1">The search for an apartment lasted longer than planning for the baby. For almost 2 years my husband and I would visit multiple open houses on a weekend throughout Brooklyn while we rented an apartment in Park Slope (a few blocks from where my husband grew up.) I had sold the apartment on the Upper East Side that I had purchased before we were married in the hopes of us finding a place to purchase together. </span><span class="s1">Finally, while I was pregnant, we found it. When we saw it, we knew Fort Greene was our home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42104" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-02.jpg" alt="Duplex before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The building is a resident-managed condominium built in 2010. The apartment is a duplex with 1,800 square feet of living space. We loved the clean, modern look and the openness and light in the apartment. It wasn’t perfect, though. All three of the bathrooms needed updating, the kitchen felt tired and the stairs weren’t kid-safe. T</span><span class="s1">he upstairs felt challenged: There was no master walk-in closet,  a huge landing off of the stairs not fully maximized, and the laundry was tucked into a closet with a small space for linen. </span><span class="s1">We had a vision and felt sure we could fix these problems while adding real value to the property. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We had one month left on our Park Slope lease and 10 weeks of work to do. This was my second renovation, but my husband’s first. He felt we needed a designer and architect in addition to a contractor. We weren’t moving plumbing or taking down walls, so an architect wasn’t needed. I convinced him of my designing abilities by creating mood boards on Houzz and pins on Pinterest and making a cohesive design plan. This DIY approach was key to keeping down costs and saving us time.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42123" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-12.jpg" alt="baby proofing stairs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">[A neutral bathoom] would ensure that a future buyer wouldn’t find the bathroom too edgy. But I also wanted it to be fun.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/a2275/staircases-child-proof-stair-gates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the safety of our baby</a>, we wanted a new banister with a closed glass barrier, and to install backings between the treads of the open stairs. Our Sweeten contractor helped me find a way to do this without compromising the style of the modern staircase, which was excellent!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While the bathrooms were the main focus, we didn’t have much budget for the kitchen, but it needed a refresh. I decided to replace two sets of cabinet doors with black-framed glass facings to give the space a new feel </span><span class="s1">and continue the open feeling of the glass banister through to the rest of the first floor</span><span class="s1">. I changed out the pendant lights with a coordinating set that has white-glass shades and black cords. This quick-fix was exciting!</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was most looking forward to working on the kids’ bath. I wanted tiles that were neutral and sophisticated—this would ensure that a future buyer wouldn’t find the bathroom too edgy. But I also wanted it to be fun for our little girl. When I saw the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wallpaper-for-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue with pink and yellow floral wallpaper</a>, I knew it was perfect. The shower tiles, with a textured gray pattern, are my absolute favorite feature.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the powder room downstairs, we decided to use wood-looking ceramic tiles on the floor I had leftover from a previous renovation. Since the tiling would be neutral, I wanted to add something amusing and sophisticated—the black-and-white floral wallpaper was a find. The large-scale pattern, absent of color, makes the small bathroom pop without looking too busy.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42108" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-06.jpg" alt="bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-BrookeNathan-Apt-Before-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the master bathroom, we had fun with hexagon floor tiles. The textured gray tiles are Sam’s favorite find—they were a splurge, but by using them to skirt the tub, we didn’t need many. We chose a large mirrored medicine cabinet to increase storage and make the tiny space feel larger.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">Overall, we made closet storage more efficient including closing off <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the washer and dryer</a>, which was located on the second-floor stairwell landing, into its own closet. Now, as a full laundry room, it hides all the linens and clutter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Through it all, our contractor and his team were incredible. They understood that I was on a tight timeline and pushed to get things done quickly. They set up a materials shopping list for me and suggested successful materials from previous renovations they&#8217;d done. They helped us source and purchase materials at good prices. My advice as a veteran renovator: when working with contractors, appreciate their expertise!</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We never had a problem we couldn’t solve with our construction team. We stayed at my mom’s Upper East Side apartment for a month while we finished, and I traveled back and forth from Manhattan to Brooklyn. Our renovation took roughly 10 weeks from start to finish. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We had a hard move-in date, as I had booked our baby-naming party and had invited 45 people to the apartment. We hit it! We moved in on Tuesday and everyone came on Saturday. It was a challenge, but worked out perfectly. Every day, my husband and I look around and think, “Wow, we did it.” We designed a space that feels like us—bright, comfortable, and home! </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>If you want to have your way with a New York City apartment, “handyman special” is the phrase to look for in the listings. And that’s exactly what our discreet homeowners—we’ll call them MR and SV—found when they walked into this one-bedroom Kew Gardens, Queens co-op. The 1,000-square-foot unit was chock full of prewar features, but would make way for a clean and modern look focusing on the kitchen and bathroom. The renovators <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/34618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the right contractor</a> who elevated an outdated apartment into the 21st century, on a budget to boot.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My wife, SV, and I purchased a co-op in a nice prewar building, where it looked like nothing had changed since the doors opened in 1939. Having renovated our previous Brooklyn co-op, we had some experience. We had no intention of turning this vintage one-bedroom into a jet-age European fantasy apartment that would look laughable in less than a year. Still, every inch of the interior, with the exception of the windows, which are the property of the co-op itself, needed work. We had a draftsman and architect draw up plans. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Meanwhile, our Sweeten bids came in; we interviewed four contractors and agreed on one. </span><span class="s1">We’d written in our project profile that we were looking for complete renovations of both the kitchen and bathroom. We’d stated upfront that we intended to source all of the appliances, cabinets, fixtures, and flooring ourselves. In the interest of full disclosure, I also wrote: “Please be aware that there are both cosmetic and structural alterations involved that will require meeting the co-op building&#8217;s management requirements and any DOB requirements.” I prefer to head off surprises whenever possible. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We began by gutting the kitchen. In addition to the cabinets and appliances, we removed the 1930s-era architectural elements including an arch and ripped out the dated kitchen door and its frame. The floor was covered in linoleum tiles. Out! Our contractor put down new </span><span class="s3">ceramic floor tiles</span><span class="s1"> and white </span><span class="s3">subway tiles</span><span class="s1"> as a backsplash for our gray-grained cabinets. The six-burner gas range was a splurge, but we did everything else clean and spare. </span><span class="s4">With proper electrical updating, we even managed a dishwasher in the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We gutted the bathroom next, in the end deciding to refinish the bathtub rather than replace it with the stand-up shower we’d planned. </span><span class="s1">SV decided on wall tiles with a beveled edge and a wispy smoke pattern. For the floor, crosshatch floor tiles were laid down in a chevron design. With input from our contractor, a glass-paneled barn-style door mounted on a track was installed which saves space in the bathroom and hallway.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our contractor stripped and stained all of the original parquet wood floors in the living areas. </span><span class="s1">We also installed smoke and carbon monoxide detectors throughout.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During every new phase, our upstanding Sweeten contractor looked at our plans, went over the steps necessary, and helped me answer questions from the building management company’s construction engineer. </span><span class="s1">SV and I grilled our contractor before we began, so we knew what we were getting into. He gave us a contract including a price and an exhaustive list of the work he’d be responsible for. He stood by the price and the work, re-negotiating our agreement only as changes came up. Whenever I had questions, I was able to contact him or his office manager. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We purchased most of the materials and ran each item by our contractor, I got a thumb’s up or an explanation for why something wouldn&#8217;t work. </span><span class="s1">I made it my business to be at the job site daily. I knew enough to stay out of the way of the workers and, if necessary, to sweep up or run out to get coffee for the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We suffered a few stops and starts, primarily due to disagreements with the co-op’s management over construction elements. </span><span class="s1">Did everything come out according to plan? Look at the photos and you decide. I’d write more, but SV wants me to install a wall-mounted broom rack. We’re getting a little closer to finished every day. And we love this old place. Especially now that it’s brand new.</span></p>

<h3>A new art deco apartment home<span>—in need of work</span></h3>
<p>Lindsay, Nicholas, and their cat, Sibyl, returned to New York City after two years in Baltimore and landed on a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in upper Manhattan. “Nicholas fell in love with the [art deco] lobby, and we both loved that it was right across the street from Inwood Hill Park and has a killer view of the Cloisters,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p>The apartment itself was so-so. It had some classic art deco features, like a sunken living room with herringbone wood floors, which Lindsay and Nicholas wanted to mix with their mid-century tastes. A bland kitchen and bathroom needed some help. The molding, doors, and paint were also due for a refresh. And then there were those two things many New Yorkers consider an ultimate luxury<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42169" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that pairs renovators with vetted general contractors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/9735" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their art deco apartment remodel</a> and chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-build firm</a> to execute the construction and the design. Lindsay and Nicholas were given a six- to eight-week timeline from start to finish and camped out in a sublet during the renovation. A few hiccups along the way stretched that timeline (more on that later).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan was to gut renovate the bathroom and make minor changes in the kitchen while doing mostly cosmetic updates to the rest of the apartment. A standout feature in the living area is the sliver of wallpaper that peaks out from the small hallway off of the living room. “Since it’s such a small space, we figured we could go a little crazy,” said Lindsay. That “little crazy” translated to an art deco-style wallpaper with teal, purple, and gold accents. “Even our friends who hate patterns and bright colors love it,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the current layout had a nook where the previous owners had placed a small breakfast table. Lindsay saw this as an ideal way to add more counter space. There was a miniature dishwasher “which made no sense since there was plenty of room for a full one,” said Lindsay. Rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut renovate</a> the kitchen (a decision the couple later regretted), they refinished the existing “country-style” cabinets in a gray modern tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark grout in the backsplash tiles upped the modern feel. The only appliance they replaced was that tiny dishwasher. “We are happy with how it came out,” said Lindsay, “but salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the only original feature that remains is the cast-iron tub with its detailed edges. Lindsay and Nicholas had it re-enameled so it matched the new bathroom. A new washer/dryer would replace an existing shower area and a shower would be added to the bathtub. For maximal storage, shelving lined the laundry wall in hard-to-reach places and double doors were installed to hide the clutter.</p>
<p>When the decision came to choose either a console sink or a vanity, they decided on a console. (The under-the-sink space became the new location for Sibyl&#8217;s litter box.) For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>, a large medicine cabinet, and niche shelves along the bathroom and shower walls did the trick. A matte black hexagonal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> became the new backdrop in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp" alt="black and white bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57241 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A feature the couple recommends to other renovators is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>. To remedy some oddly-placed shelves and a rod, their Sweeten contractor ripped everything out of the bedroom closet and installed a new system that can easily be changed later on as storage needs shift. “Custom designing the closets made a huge difference in how useful the spaces were,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42171" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-04.gif" alt="Washer dryer renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project hit a major snag when it came to the electrical work which pushed the end date back. Wiring dedicated to powering the washer/dryer had to be installed and ripped out twice from the ceiling. Despite this, it still shorted out the power after only a few uses. In the end, it was discovered there was a faulty part in the basement and the situation was fixed. Throughout the issue, Sweeten&#8217;s customer service, which checks in on renovations until projects are completed, stayed in communication until it was resolved and helped coordinate a new realistic timeline agreeable to all parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After their experience, Lindsay and Nicholas came out with a home they loved, but also some things they would do differently next time. “Always gut renovate,” said Lindsay. “We were trying to be thrifty by keeping the kitchen cabinets.” The other tip: plan for the renovation to take twice as long. But ultimately, the Sweeten contractor did a fantastic job,” said Lindsay<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and enhanced the features of the apartment to turn it into a unique home for their family.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Gus, a public health researcher, and Katherine, a chef, bought their Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, co-op over five years ago with every intention to renovate—just not right away. When they and their dog Miles, were ready, they came to Sweeten and </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30921"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to facilitate a full remodel of their dated bathroom—a standard white-tiled space with a built-in metal hamper from the ‘50s, impractical storage niches above the pedestal sink, and layers of old tiles on the walls. “The previous owners’ attempts at updating involved putting tile on top of existing tile,” Gus shared.</span></p>

They were willing to put more money toward things that would be used and touched regularly, like the shower and sink handles. </span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HJHiUiD4Kw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They created a cohesive and cool look with a clever mix of tiles: a herringbone ceramic for a statement wall, classic white ceramic for the remaining walls, and dark porcelain on the floor. The combined bathtub and shower is lined with marble, which their contractor also used to build floating shelves. Matte black fixtures for the sink and shower tie it all together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In lieu of a traditional vanity,  Gus and Katherine chose a wall-hung sink that saves on floor space. The basin is offset giving more counter space on one side. Plus, the double-mirrors with storage ledges provide another storage option.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As first-time renovators, they were also happy to have hired a design-build firm who not only handled the construction but the design, too. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a designer as a part of our renovation team was hands down one of the best decisions we made,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: One of their biggest pieces of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice? ”Be prepared to have lots of feelings as you go through this process.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Allyson</i></span></p>
<h3>Starting with the bathroom</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allyson purchased her East Flatbush, Brooklyn home with the intent to renovate and make it her own. Over the years, she collected goods and artwork from around the world. Her first home would showcase those finds and express her creativity. Allyson </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her renovation project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, for a full bathroom makeover and hired her general contractor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An electrical inspection revealed a full electrical update was required. According to the electrician, stereo wire had been used to establish connections. Therefore, it was a matter of when, not if, the house would catch fire. Her scope had just expanded.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="allyson-posing-outside-entrance-door" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40918 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-11.jpg" alt="allyson standing outside the entrance door and brick exterior after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>Personalize and modernize a dated bathroom</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allyson had a very clear vision for the space. “I wanted my bathroom to combine and reflect my love of vintage, mid-century modern, Afrocentrism, brass, and natural wood elements,” she shared. A separate shower and bathtub were also important. The 1950s wall hamper was removed and a closet in the adjacent bedroom was claimed to build the shower. P.S. That bedroom turned into a full walk-in closet!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Allyson-Bathroom-Before.jpg" alt="Blue tiled bathroom with gray wall before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48784" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Allyson-Bathroom-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Allyson-Bathroom-Before-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Allyson-Bathroom-Before-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="double-walnut-vanity-gold-sink" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40908 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-01.jpg" alt="double walnut vanity with gold sink and faucets and fixtures and white tiles on floor and bathroom and walk-in shower after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-01-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every element, from the flooring to the vanity, was a result of Allyson’s pursuit to personalize the space. She and her contractor worked together to ensure the materials she found were the right size and configuration. “I took on the part of figuring out what I wanted. He would instruct what mechanisms it’d need to fit,” she said. Her contractor turned a vintage credenza Allyson found online into a vanity. She installed brass sinks that were sourced from Australia.</span></p>

<h3>Using geometric spaces and salvaged materials</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bathroom floor, a mix of marble tile and brass rod inlays, required laying it out in a separate room and individually cutting the brass pieces. “I knew I wanted a look that was geometric, unusual, and somewhat imperfect,” Allyson said. The &#8220;new&#8221; door, an 1800s brownstone pocket door from Big Reuse, a nonprofit for salvaged and surplus building materials, became Allyson’s personal undertaking and definitely earned her some sweat equity. After at least two months of stripping and sanding to remove seemingly endless layers of paint and varnish, she decided to leave it to the professionals. “I could not be happier with having that vintage element added to my bathroom,” she said. Overall the scheme is a mix of cool and warm tones, with brass making an appearance in the shower and bathtub fixtures, as well as the lighting. The shower tiles, a rich aqua, have a windblown texture—the idea behind them was to make you feel like you’re surrounded by water.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="free-standing-bathtub-with-gold-faucet" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40912 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-05.jpg" alt="free standing bathtub with gray tiles on half walls and gold towel bars and two floating shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest and most time-consuming part of the renovation was sourcing all the materials. Allyson hit all the stops: Etsy, Instagram, Anthropologie, and international sites to find ideas. The process even inspired her to start a business called Cultivate Self, where she’ll curate items inspired by global design and travel, and share her tips for cultivating a home.</span></p>

<h3>Having a flexible general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the entire process, Allyson’s contractor helped to achieve her vision. “My contractor was patient and never dismissed my ideas as ridiculous or impossible.  If something wasn&#8217;t how I liked it, he made sure that it was corrected. Because a lot of the items I wanted to use came from outside of the country, he worked around my undependable delivery schedule.  He took a potentially stressful situation and provided steady guidance and expertise,” Allyson said. “I truly appreciate their amazing work and help in making this renovation happen. I really feel like my bathroom reflects my creative vision and I love every inch of it.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gold-sink-with-faucets-fixtures" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40916 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-09.jpg" alt="walnut double vanity with rectangle gold basin sink and gold faucets and fixtures and floating shelf after renovation " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she’s still very much in the weeds of the rest of her renovation, the homeowner and first-time renovator has advice to share. “Don’t be afraid to take risks. I read that if you’re not doing something in your renovation that scares you, you’re not doing it right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The brass inlay and marble floor was inspired by a backsplash Allyson saw on Instagram.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Simple streamlining makes good design even better</h2>
<p><em>Rebecca’s vision for the unique triplex apartment in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village started to form the first day she set foot in it. She was smitten with the multi-level layout and loved that the space had two full bathrooms. Rebecca, an Emmy-winning TV producer, bought the approximately 800<span style="color: #333333;">-square-foot,</span> one-bedroom co-op and moved in. Eight years went by before she was ready to renovate. It was time well spent. She’d used it to learn what she loved—and didn’t—about the upstairs, downstairs abode. Armed with a list of must-dos and ideas, Rebecca posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects renovators with vetted general contractors. Soon, she had her Sweeten design-build firm signed on, ready to transform her home from super to superlative.</em></p>

<p>I loved the stacked layout of my apartment from the moment I saw it. The high ceilings made it feel like a loft—just the downtown Manhattan vibe I was looking for. Triplexes are rare; the three floors are a surprise when you walk in. I purchased the co-op eight years ago, knowing I would eventually renovate, but I wanted to live in it for a while, to think about the space and what I wanted to do with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40693 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40694 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />I also wanted to take my time to find a contractor I really liked. This was my first experience with a renovation, and I had no idea how to approach it. Unfortunately, my first encounters with construction people left me feeling even more lost. I had spoken with a friend about my desire to change the apartment and told her about my frustration at trying to find the right contractor. She had a friend who’d had great success with Sweeten, and she suggested I check it out. After I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>, I met with several bidding firms, but when I met the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor I ultimately hired</a>, I knew it was a match. We hit it off right away and she was genuinely excited to help me turn the apartment into a place I loved.</p>

The three-level layout wouldn’t make it easy, but the home did have good light, and the open staircases were a start. I wanted to free up the square footage on each floor while making every area more functional. My main focus was on the kitchen and bathrooms. The kitchen was small and closed-off and was in desperate need of a refresh. Both bathrooms were due to be gutted and redone. Like everyone else in New York City, I also wanted more (and smarter) storage. The contractor got it immediately. She really listened to what I wanted and helped to turn my thoughts into things we could make happen, while at the same time coming up with her own innovative ideas.</p>
<blockquote><p>The kitchen was a total win, and that gave me the courage to take on the next phase: the renovation of both bathrooms.</p></blockquote>

She started by helping me come up with a color palette. I really like whites, grays, and cool blues, and I decided I wanted to carry those colors through the apartment so it felt like one cohesive space. Bright white has the amazing ability to modernize and brighten simultaneously, and we went with a lot of it, including on the walls, cabinetry, and shelving units to achieve a light, open look. I liked the contrast to the existing wood floors, which had been a honey-brown color, but looked so much better restained in a rich, dark walnut.</p>

The room was tiny and walled off from the rest of the apartment. It had a beat-up butcher-block counter and golden-brown, ‘80s-style cabinets. We decided to knock down the inside wall and open up the kitchen to the long, little-used entry hall adjacent to it. Later, when the contractor tore out the wall and the old kitchen behind it, the space immediately felt lighter and more spacious. It made a huge impact on the flow of the apartment.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved the complementary pairing of white and gray, so we chose a striking, slate-veined marble for the countertops and the facings on the newly created kitchen island. It coordinates beautifully with the stainless-steel appliances and cabinet hardware. The island offers plenty of room for a two-stool breakfast bar, and a sleek new storage unit lining the wall, with upper and lower cabinets, offers kitchen-goods storage and auxiliary counter space, too.</p>

<p>The kitchen was a total win, and that gave me the courage to take on the next phase: the renovation of both bathrooms. We did them one after the other, starting with the first-floor guest bath before moving upstairs to the master.</p>
<p>In each of the bathrooms, I hoped to find ways to create more space, while making the room feel brighter and more welcoming. Tile turned out to be the key. While shopping for it, I fell so in love with the stunning patterns I found at Ann Sacks that for both bathrooms, I selected the tile designs first—and fixtures and other elements to accommodate them. Once again, I went with whites and grays, doing the downstairs guest bath in marble, with a graphic black-and-white pattern on the floor.</p>

The construction team ripped out the old dove-gray tile and went to work on a sleek, simple design in black and white. Since this is my personal bathroom, I went with a glass shower panel in a stand-up shower. The small, wall-mounted vanity has a sleek matte black finish. To top off my storage desires and help the bathroom stay minimal, my Sweeten contractor set a giant, mirrored storage cabinet into the wall—this spot for bottles, jars, and brushes has a door that doubles as a full-length mirror.</p>

Even with one working bathroom at all times, it was really not fun! I kept telling myself that once the construction was finished, it would be amazing! And it really is. That dose of demo-inspired misery made my brand-new bathrooms look even shinier!</p>
<p>All told, the renovation lasted nine months. The kitchen and baths were the most work, but the job included paint and other aesthetic finishes in the living room and bedroom, and on both staircases as well. At every turn, I was in awe of, and so grateful for, my contractor’s knack for understanding how to make the most of small spaces. From the ingenious pull-out pantry next to the refrigerator she found for the kitchen to her suggestion of swapping out an iron inset on the second floor for a light-channeling glass panel, she helped me make the most of the space. My new-and-improved apartment is incredible. I’m so happy to come home every day!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>For its 100th birthday, two sisters give their family home a top-to-bottom refresh</h2>
<p><em>In some ways, nothing has changed at the Jamaica, New York house that sisters Gayle, Merri, and their family have called home for 50 years. But while the bones of the home, like the family that lived there, have remained the same, most of what meets the eye has changed. Calling on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, Gayle, a freelance brand strategist, and Merri, a corporate accountant, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired a general contractor</a> to bring all 1,200 square feet of the two-story, traditional-style house up to date. And they did it just in time to commemorate its 100th birthday.</em></p>

<p>Ripping out the dark brown paneling and the shag carpeting of our family’s detached home in Jamaica, a working-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, couldn’t have come soon enough. Our parents bought the home in 1970 and our family has lived in it continuously since then. I’ve been living in the home since 2012, Merri moved in in 2014, and we purchased the house from our mom, who had downsized to an apartment by then, in 2017.</p>

The space was functional, but it was a little worn, outdated, dark, and drafty.</p>
<p>Our main goals for the reno were to dispel the darkness throughout the house and to bring out the home’s original character, which had really been buried. On a purely functional level, we also wanted to make the house more comfortable by upgrading the interior insulation and making sure the electrical and plumbing were up to snuff.</p>
<p>The flooring throughout the house was another element that helped tie everything together. After peeling back the old carpeting, we discovered that all of the original hardwood floors were in great shape for a house built in the 1920s, so we ended up just sanding and staining them dark walnut. Not having to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay for new flooring</a> saved us a ton of money. We then installed walnut wood-look porcelain tile in the kitchen and bathroom to keep the look cohesive.</p>

<blockquote><p>[we found] a stained glass window behind paneling in the dining room. I wanted to keep it, so the contractor protected it and framed it out without missing a beat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between Merri and I, there must be dozens of books in the house. Part what we wanted in making over the house was one central place to keep them. I’ve always loved houses with libraries, so we designated one long wall in the dining room for the library, and bought a six-tier bookshelf to hold everything.</p>
<p>The dining room is located right off of the living room and off of that is an enclosed porch, which we turned into a mudroom. To section off the two spaces, we asked for a glass door, but there was a miscommunication with the contractor and an exterior door was installed instead. What we really wanted was a French door with multiple panes of glass from top to bottom. Our contractor quickly swapped it out for exactly what we wanted, but it was a lesson on how to be specific with requests!</p>

<p>But before we got to decorating, there was some renovating to be done. Our biggest challenge was getting the kitchen exactly right. We moved a corner sink to a new spot under the large window overlooking the backyard. We didn’t want to knock down walls or change the footprint of the kitchen, but we needed more storage. So we got cabinets that go all the way up to the ceiling and added a pantry, which had never been in the house before. We also added a ginormous refrigerator, a dishwasher, and we swapped out the microwave over the range for a freestanding hood. The sizes and layout of the upper and lower cabinets had to be precise to accommodate all of these additions without making the room look overstuffed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40780 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40781 mb-0 size-full" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For the bathroom walls, we found 12” x 24” rectangular blocks of gray fabric-look tile. It’s very understated but luxe and looks like suit fabric. We stayed in a hotel that used this kind of tile and managed to track down a lookalike. Everyone thinks it’s wallpaper until they touch it.</p>
<p>As first-time renovators, this was actually one of the biggest lessons we learned: Write your requests down! First, it helps you and whoever you may be renovating with (in this case, my sister) get on the same page. Merri and I have very different tastes and writing down what we wanted forced us to find common ground. The first day we met with our Sweeten contractor matches, we had a list ready for them to react to and this saved so much time. We were able to find out exactly how far our budget would stretch. The list also allowed our contractor to help us prioritize needs and wants. We kept revisiting it throughout the renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40783 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Prior to this, I personally hadn’t done more than paint a wall and put up shelves in my apartment, so the thought of a top to bottom house renovation was mildly terrifying. We were most worried about what was lurking behind the walls—the condition of the electrical and the plumbing. The house is almost 100 years old, so you’re never sure what you’re going to find.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw7gQyvamVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="reno-video-image"  class="alignnone wp-image-40893 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg" alt="image of behind the reno video" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>We did discover that two support beams were missing under the front entryway floor, which was why it sloped so bad. When our contractor called to tell me, he already had a solution to suggest and pricing ready, so we were able to easily make the correction without impacting the timeline. A good surprise, though, was finding a stained glass window behind paneling in the dining room that was removed. I wanted to keep it, so the contractor protected it and framed it out without missing a beat.</p>

<p>I never felt like I was out of the loop on what was going on with our contractor and his team. Even when our mom became ill one month into construction, we didn’t have a lot of time to talk to him or meet with him, but our back and forth communication had been so great before that he was able to just keep going, handling all of the small decisions and only calling if there was a major decision that needed our input. It was a relief that the work didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Our Sweeten Client Services contacts were also great with checking in weekly to see if everything was proceeding as planned. Three months after we started, the renovation was completed. My favorite part was experiencing how the atmosphere of the rooms transformed; I’d grown up here and everything was very clear in my mind, just the way my parents had it. The renovation actually made it feel like a completely new house. Now, it feels like a calm sanctuary. I just love how relaxed I instantly feel when I walk through the front door.</p>

Ditch a clunky layout. Add a kitchen island. And do it before the baby arrives. Those were Tara and Brian’s four main renovation goals after they bought a two-bedroom co-op (with a small office space) in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The prewar apartment was an upgrade in space and number of bedrooms from their previous rental as the couple prepared to start a family.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40338 mt-24 size-full" title="family portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40323 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>However, it was outdated. Oak cabinets in the kitchen and patterned tiles in the bathroom, all from the &#8217;90s, made the room feel old. A kitchen peninsula awkwardly dissected the eating area and living room. The fridge took up prime real estate, blocking light from the apartment’s rear. “The previous owners had lived there for eight years and hadn’t really updated it,” Tara said. They decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/meet-the-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose a general contractor.</a></p>
<p>The couple decided to do most of the renovation before moving in so Tara, who was pregnant at the time, wouldn’t inhale any dust. Once the water was connected and the messy work complete, Brian and Tara took up residence while their contractor worked around them.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40337 size-full" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40326 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" alt="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For Tara, adding that <span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island was non-negotiable and it turned out to be one of the crowning glories of the renovation. Their contractor had a reclaimed wood supplier in Pennsylvania and the couple picked out a big slab of walnut. They went for a rustic look, leaving two sides with a live edge and enhanced the wood’s cherry red tone with a lacquer. “<span style="color: #333333;">I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said, adding that now when they have friends over, that still proves true.</span></p>
<p>Their contractor suggested a workaround for the refrigerator. The area already had three big clunky closets across from the main kitchen. Why not match those closets to the new cabinets in the kitchen and hide the fridge in there? It turned into a perfect solution that helped the flow of space between the living room, kitchen and the back of the apartment.</p>

The new kitchen layout had a few feet of wall space that wasn’t serving any purpose other than be covered in the white subway tiles Brian and Tara picked for their backsplash. The contractor saw the potential for a small pantry. When it’s shut, it looks like a tiled wall. But pop the magnetic doors open, and a 10-inch deep cabinet is revealed. “<span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful,</span>” said Tara. “Our friends think it is so cool.”</p>
<p>To create a sense of openness in the kitchen, Tara and Brian ditched the cabinets above the counter <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelves-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in favor of open shelving</a>. Their contractor used the walnut from the new kitchen island to create the shelving. The red proved the perfect accent of color and texture to the couple’s color palette of black and white.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQtbfhBsVrk&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="behind-the-video-image" class="alignnone wp-image-40850 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia.jpg" alt="image of behind the reno video" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>Sticking closely to that color scheme, Tara wanted a darker stain with a matte finish on the wood floors. Brian thought it needed more gloss. “We spent a lot of time figuring out what stain to use,” Tara said. “My husband eventually came around.”</p>

Of everything in the renovation, making a decision on what <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span> faucets to install took the most time. Tara wanted something modern and functional. Brian had a strong view that it should have one handle instead of two. In the end, they found something “that we both didn’t hate,” Tara said.</p>
<p>She also felt strongly in favor of a glass partition rather than a shower curtain, “to make the space look bigger.” Brian pointed out the difficulties of maneuvering around a partial glass barrier when bathing their soon-to-arrive infant. To get on the same page on the glass, Tara volunteered to take the lead on baby bathing responsibilities. “At the moment she is still getting washed in the kitchen sink because it is so big,” she said.</p>

<p>The renovation hit a snag when their general contractor uncovered some serious water damage to the bathroom flooring. The couple had planned on keeping the original bathtub since they thought it was in pretty good shape. This new discovery meant they needed a new one. On the bright side, it gave Tara the chance to cross something off her “want” list: a bath with a tiled side.  “<span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor was very upfront with what was needed and what the cost would be,” Tara said, of the mid-project pivot. “He gave us options of what to do about it.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40331 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg" alt="study" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The walnut wood turned into the gift that kept giving. After completing the kitchen, their contractor used the remainder to create three small shelves in the bathroom. With some wood still unused, he carved up more shelves for the <span style="color: #333333;">office</span>.</p>
<p>The renovation took three months to complete. During the project, Brian and Tara communicated often with their Sweeten contractor via text message and in person. “He was so great because we would text with him and he would keep us up-to-date even on minor details,” Tara said.</p>
<p>The couple also learned the art of compromise during the process. “Brian had to remind me of what was practical even if I really wanted something,” Tara said. But at the same time, don’t be afraid to get creative, she advised. The secret pantry behind a tiled wall and walnut shelving in the bathroom are two examples of making inspired decisions on the go. “<span style="color: #333333;">We realized if we thought creatively,” said Tara, “we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.”</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sharon and Laurence have lived in their Financial District apartment for 25 years. They moved to the area for more space and because, at that time, it was considered “off the radar.” Eight years ago, they renovated the kitchen but were hesitant to tackle the bathroom—mostly due to the logistics of living without one during a remodel. But the space was falling apart and they hardly used the tub, so it finally came to the point where a renovation was in order. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We felt confident with Sweeten when we learned that they had contractors that worked in New York City and were comfortable with the unique challenges of working in a co-op with its strict rules,” Sharon said. </span>They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to the platform and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="brown-vanity-under-white-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48791 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown vanity under white sink and white toilet with tank before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharon and Laurence had initially hoped to expand the 48-square-foot bathroom, but after investigating a “mystery space” behind a wall, they learned it wasn’t quite big enough to make a significant difference in the overall footprint. A debate also occurred over whether to install a new tub or move forward with just a shower since tubs are often a big selling point for buyers. Ultimately, they decided to go with a shower and replace all the fixtures and finishes to create a neutral, easy-to-clean, and minimalist bathroom.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-eGuEr6Y6U&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="proper-etiquette-video-link-image"  class="alignnone wp-image-40848 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette.jpg" alt="video link image of what is a proper etiquette by sweeten founder" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their contractor recommended that in order to get the project done as quickly as possible, the homeowners should plan to have all the materials delivered and ready to install upon demolition. “We h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ave high-end aspirations with a down-to-earth budget so, to that end, we spent a considerable amount of time sourcing the best prices on fixtures that we liked,” Sharon said. The couple ran their choices by their contractor to make sure everything was compatible and found materials that aligned with their vision, including all-recessed lighting instead of separate sconces and large-scale tiles for the walls and floors.</span></p>

During demolition, their contractor encountered a waste pipe that ran horizontally not vertically—unlike many other jobs he’d worked on. The homeowners couldn’t return the toilet and had to pay a restocking fee, but their contractor went to a showroom with photos of the waste pipe to find a solution. Turns out, few manufacturers actually make toilets that fit horizontal waste pipes, but he found one for the homeowners to order. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the work was near completion as delivery issues with the toilet cropped up (all out of the contractor and homeowner’s control.) After a fourth delivery—previous toilets arrived broken—they were able to make the final touches, including installing the glass shower door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through it all, Sharon and Laurence stayed in the apartment during the renovation, using a neighbor’s apartment for bathroom access. Even though it wasn’t ideal, the bathroom was cordoned off with plastic, and Sharon thought it was better to be living on-site anyways to deal with potential issues quickly and efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the couple is very happy with their new bathroom. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor was professional, responsible, and able work with us to get the job done in a timely manner considering the toilet problems,” Sharon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sharon and Laurence’s apartment is in a former office building originally built in 1902!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Be open to the idea of unconcealed storage  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how big your bathroom is, the first thought to reduce clutter would be to keep it all tucked away in drawers and cabinets. But when things are out of sight, they are also harder to find. Strategically-placed open shelving adds visual interest and can make life a little easier. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has seen many renovators creatively add open storage to their baths. From recessed open shelving to floating shelves, see what ideas you might want to incorporate in your own bathroom renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27546" title="recessed shelving" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria and Eric’s small bath needed storage that would blend seamlessly with their minimalist Scandinavian apartment. A </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recessed wall unit with open shelves </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the perfect solution. Plus, hiding it behind the door means it’s only visible when the door is closed.</span></p>

			<h2>California transplants undergo a bathroom renovation in a New York suburb</h2>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom in need of an upgrade</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice’s work as a geneticist brought her husband Derek, their son Acelen, and the family’s miniature poodle, Royal, to Pleasantville, NY all the way from California. They purchased a single-family 3,300-square-foot home in the area and started planning for a bathroom renovation right away. The existing bathroom was definitely dated and as Alice put it, “The tub was so old, I didn’t want to set foot in it.” They wanted to renovate to create a fully enclosable wet-space to shower and then soak in the tub without stepping out of the room (which keeps the warm air from escaping). The plan was a similar arrangement to a bathroom renovation they completed in their California house.</span></p>
<div></div>

<h3>The right general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice and Derek’s main concern was finding a general contractor. “We had a contracting team who was essentially a family-friend in Cali</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fornia, so finding the right contractor who we could trust in New York was one of the biggest hurdles for us to get started,” Alice shared. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, received matches, and ultimately </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">selected a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to overhaul the bathroom.</span></p>

<h3>Changing the bathroom layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sticking with the same overall square footage, the homeowners worked with their Sweeten general contractor to reconfigure the bathroom’s floor plan to include the desired wet-space. The bathtub was moved into the same room as the shower, and the toilet moved outside of the formerly enclosed room and directly across from the vanity. Their contractor recommended moving the main entry door, too. &#8220;I </span>didn&#8217;t know moving doors was so easy and it made the layout much easier to work with,&#8221; Alice said.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-06-1.jpg" alt="neutral-shower-tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-40376 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Neutral and calm colors</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soothing palette of creams and tans contributes to the spa-like feel, as well as modern fixtures for the tub and shower. The renovators chose </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bathroom-trends-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wood-look tile flooring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s also waterproof and a vanity with natural wood doors for cohesion.  In the wet-room, a pebble-effect floor helps prevent slipping and creates a sense of separation between the spaces.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-05-1.jpg" alt="Light-tiled-shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-40375 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Their vision a reality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project went smoothly with the exception of one minor delivery delay with the bathtub. Work was stalled until it arrived and in retrospect, Alice says ordering materials ahead of demolition would’ve been a better idea.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our general contractor did a great job turning our vision into a reality,” Alice shared. “He </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always listened to our ideas and worked with us to make them into operational tactics.” Now the family has a new bathroom retreat, and Alice loves soaking in the tub after a long day at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The toilet was outfitted with a bidet toilet seat, adding to the luxe vibe.</span></p>

<strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After living in their Crown Heights, Brooklyn, apartment for about two years, and dealing with random leaks from the bathtub and falling tiles, Sonya and Aaron decided it was renovation time. “Instead of putting a Band-Aid on it, we decided to completely change the layout to optimize the floor plan to its maximum potential,” Aaron said. They </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a clean and seamless bathroom, with the overarching goal of making the 42-square-foot space look and feel as big as possible. They were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to take on the remodel.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-white-bathtub"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48801 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aaron-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White bathroom with white bathtub and shower curtain before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aaron-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aaron-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aaron-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Rearranging the floor plan was definitely the biggest priority. “Imagine squeezing yourself into a tight bar bathroom, but it is your actual bathroom. Our sink was literally the size of two small hands,” Aaron said. When demolition began, however, they discovered pipes that didn’t allow them to move around plumbing as originally planned. All of the pipes needed to be rerouted and replaced to meet code—which did end up costing the couple more than expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to give up a closet in the adjacent bedroom and use that extra space to reinvent the layout. The bathtub moved along the window wall and the toilet next to the sink. They installed custom wood shelves in a spot where the piping couldn’t be rerouted.</span></p>

They chose light tile along one wall to make the bathroom appear bigger, then a dark gray tile along the back wall to create a sense of depth. The couple installed a toilet with the tank hidden behind the wall to keep with the streamlined feel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As effortless as their new bathrooms looks, however, this renovation did not come without its challenges. The couple did expect to uncover issues because of the building’s age, but the problems that ensued were a little beyond what they thought they’d be. The bathroom basically had to be built from scratch, including the subfloor and plumbing. “Our contractor was patient with us and notified us about all the issues as they were coming up,” Aaron shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All work had to be coordinated with the co-op’s schedule too, which extended the timeline. But the result was well worth the wait. “We love our new bathroom. It is literally night and day from before,” Aaron said. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The space-saving glass door swings out just above the toilet. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bathroom floor and wall tile; sink and vanity: </span><a href="https://www.porcelanosa-usa.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porcelanosa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tackling a bigger bathroom renovation project—six ways to make the most of the space you have</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a too-small bathroom?  While some renovators choose to expand the space or reimagine the footprint, those types of changes can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the budget</a>. So how can you make a bathroom appear larger with the space you already have? Read on to learn how Sweeten general contractors undertook bigger bathroom renovation projects. Here&#8217;s how they updated homeowners&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small bathrooms to feel bigger—without changing the overall square footage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>1.) Install a floating vanity<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25453 size-full" title="floating vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="floating vanity" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>If having a closet in or next to your bathroom isn&#8217;t an option, consider a vanity with drawers or doors. Some vanities are freestanding, but floating vanities are attached to the wall and do not “sit” on the ground. That extra space means the flooring can extend to the wall, which actually makes the room look larger. Nancy&#8217;s bathroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfectly demonstrates that idea</a>, showing off the ornate black and white tile. Since she couldn&#8217;t change the layout of the space due to code compliance, this offered a great alternative in the overall vision of opening up the bathroom.</p>
<h2><b>2.) Or if you have enough storage, try a pedestal sink</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38077 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="black-hexagon-bathroom-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" alt="pedastal sink with black faucet and fixtures and wooden shelves above toilet and black hexagon floor tiles and medicine cabinet with mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">If storage isn’t an issue, a classic space-saving option is a pedestal sink. In Saira and her husband’s East Village apartment, they had two small bathrooms they needed to update to accommodate their family of four. In the powder room, they opted for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/guest-full-bathroom-renovation-east-village/"><span class="s1">classic, white porcelain pedestal sink.</span></a> They used shelving above the toilet and a mirrored vanity for their storage needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp" alt="Black and white bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy and Chris chose a</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pedestal sink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with console legs that show off the tiled walls and floors, and give this classic NYC bathroom a more spacious feel. &#8220;In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open.

<h2><b>3) Stick with neutrals or go tone-on-tone</b></h2>

A safe bet to opening up a small bathroom? Choose neutrals that don’t compete for attention. Jessica and Kevin swapped out pink marble for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-bathroom-goes-from-clunky-to-classy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white and gray color palette</a> that lent their space a more spa-like feel.</p>
<h2><b>4.) Opt for a larger mirror</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36996 size-full" title="small bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" alt="small bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina had wanted to renovate her 550-square-foot studio in Murray Hill since she moved in. She knew exactly what she wanted—including tons of bathroom storage space. To achieve this, she </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">installed a large, mirrored medicine cabinet.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The mirror takes up most of the wall, automatically giving the room the illusion of more space, without changing the layout at all.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>5.) Take advantage of wall space</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22407 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="recessed storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="Scandinavian white bathroom with storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">Even if your bathroom has a small footprint, you can always build onto the wall, or in Maria and Eric&#8217;s case <i>into</i> the walls. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/"><span class="s1">recessed shelving</span></a> unit tucks in just behind their bathroom door. This minimalist solution boasts more storage without adding bulk.</p>
<h2><b>6.) Ditch the tub &amp; shower curtain for a bigger bathroom</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30666 size-full" title="light-filled bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg" alt="light-filled bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>A fairly common bigger bathroom renovation project is to ditch the tub in favor of a walk-in shower with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-new-baths-top-off-a-remodel-odyssey/">a glass shower door.</a> Using glass in place of a shower curtain allows light to flow through the space, which is especially important if the bathroom has a single source of natural light. In one of Tara and Mike&#8217;s bathrooms, they did just that, while leaving the rest of the floorplan as-is.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35156 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Gramercy Park bathroom, bathroom renovation, tile, glass divider, tile floor, tile wall, toilet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A glass bathroom door is even more effective when used in an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open shower style</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like in Charon and Lex’s bathroom. Removing the tub altogether opened up the space, making it more comfortable for two people (especially since Lex is 6&#8217;2&#8243;)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another factor that worked in their favor: the use of one color (in different shades). </span></p>

<h3>Remodeling for a fresher aesthetic</h3>
<p>Erica purchased her first apartment, a one-bedroom in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. “Everything was in working order, but my hope was to eventually fully gut and renovate the kitchen and bathroom,” she said. First the kitchen, and two years later decided the bathroom’s time had come. The all-pink-everything (the toilet, tub, sink, and wall tiles) had to go. “I knew I wanted a more zen, spa-like bathroom without the added expense of switching the location of the existing plumbing,” she shared.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Pink bathtub in a pink bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48812" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="Hexagon tiles in bathroom and herringbone vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48818" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Renovation team collaboration</h3>
<p>Ready to get started, Erica posted her project to Sweeten. “Sweeten was extremely attentive to my needs as I searched for a contractor,” she shared. After reviewing her options of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local general contractors</a> in Brooklyn, she hired one to work with. Then, her renovation team—her Sweeten general contractor and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interior designer Amy E. Bishop</a>—joined forces to revamp Erica’s bathroom into a relaxing retreat.</p>
<h4>Key design element: hexagon tiles in the bathroom</h4>
<p>They developed a design that would maximize style and storage. Amy and Erica created a Pinterest board to share ideas, and the designer helped guide the overall look, starting with a three-drawer vanity the homeowner loved. As they were finalizing their concept, Erica’s mom pointed out the lack of a backsplash behind the vanity might be an issue, calling her &#8220;a splasher.&#8221; Hence, they designed a backsplash with hexagon tiles in the bathroom. The cascading formation carried over from the shower wall, offered a creative and practical solution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="Hexagon tiled shower wall with large vanity mirror over sink and backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="678" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48825" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11-300x203.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="Light pink bathroom with built in shower niche and bathrobe hook after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48821" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Storage in a small bathroom</h3>
<p>With limited space, the storage options would get creative. Shelves above the door hold toilet paper and other supplies, while a large medicine cabinet and custom in-shower shelves host Erica’s growing collection of skincare and beauty products. Her general contractor played an integral part in executing the custom idea. The original design placed the shelves on a different wall. However, once her contractor discovered it was solid cement, they relocated the double-stacked niches to the bathroom&#8217;s back wall accented by the hexagon tiles. The contracting team also made sure all the electrical was up to code (which wasn’t the case before they came in).</p>

<h3>Hexagon tiles in a bathroom bring on the calm</h3>
<p>Living with her cat Gigi onsite throughout the renovation and using the powder room in her building’s laundry room were the biggest hardships Erica experienced during the five-week renovation. They were well-worth the sacrifice.</p>
<p>“I absolutely love the bathroom!  Everything is so fresh and clean with a much more sophisticated color palette and design. With my enormous medicine cabinet, shower niches, vanity, and shelving over the door, I appreciate the ability to be much more organized getting ready for work in the morning,” Erica said.</p>
