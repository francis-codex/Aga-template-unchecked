										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>After spending many years patching up a rental they lived in together, two architects decided to purchase their very own fixer-upper on the top floor of an 1890s brownstone on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. One may wonder whether Kate Meagher and Arthur Liu had the same basic questions as non-design pros when it came to budget calculations, the cost of relocating plumbing, or even where to find a contractor, and the answer is yes! Having fallen in love with the view of the Hudson River, high ceilings, and the fact that the apartment hadn’t been touched since the ‘60s, they embraced the cozy new home to make &lt;500-square-foot feel significantly bigger. The couple came to Sweeten to find a team to help them reconfigure walls, add space to the kitchen, and renovate the bath. Here, Kate and Arthur tell us about their renovation journey, including a painting project that took longer than anticipated—but the results were well worth it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21477" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21420"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Kate Meagher </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arthur and I had been living in an apartment for around seven years, which belonged to his family. That apartment—much loved—was a constant work in progress. We improved the kitchen and bathroom, installed new lighting, and suffered through two floods (thanks, upstairs neighbors!) which required new ceilings and flooring yet again. As architects, we loved it—it was great to have a rental which we could experiment on. At a certain point, however, it seemed that we should be directing our energy toward a place that was truly ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During our search, Arthur and I had gotten into a rhythm. After each Sunday’s open house tour, we’d stop in whichever neighborhood we ended up in, get a drink, and sketch floor plans over the broker’s listing sheets. Could we fit a dishwasher? How did the closet compare with our old one? How much would it cost if the plumbing needed to be reconfigured? (Sweeten’s construction and renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> were extremely helpful setting initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovation-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> targets.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were obviously looking for a fixer-upper, and when we saw this apartment, we fell in love despite its tiny size. It’s right next to Riverside Park, on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone. The ceilings are high and the bay windows still have the original curved glass. In the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, we can see the Hudson. Best yet, outside of some electrical updates, the apartment hadn’t been touched since the 1960s. The main priorities for this apartment were to update and expand the kitchen, renovate the bathroom, and to squeeze as much storage space in without impacting the small footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had come across Sweeten at some point in our apartment search, and it was the first place we looked for a general contractor after we closed. Arthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don’t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation—we needed help finding someone! Sweeten definitely filled a niche for us, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project</a>. We interviewed several and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>. I was struck by the notes he took throughout our initial walk-through, and that he asked for time to review further on his own. We felt he really listened and understood what we wanted and could accomplish it within our timeframe and budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21455 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Arthur_floor_plan-723x482.jpg" alt="Arthur_floor_plan" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21431 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21436 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21438 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21439" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the classic detailing in the apartment and wanted to preserve everything we could that was more or less original. However, both our sensibilities skew contemporary/minimalist when designing, and we were looking to strike a balance. We decided to make only a few key alterations to the floorplan. First, the wall separating the kitchen/bath zone and the living room was moved, gaining us a little more than a foot-and-a-half extra. The bathroom feels more generous now, and most importantly, it allowed us to configure a narrow L-shape for the kitchen. We chose tall doors for them to align with the height of the bay windows, and drew a custom profile for the door frames—beautifully executed by our contractor’s team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The extra L-shaped length was critical to add a full-height refrigerator, full-height pantry cabinet, and an 18” dishwasher. We installed shallow 15-inch-deep cabinets in the new leg, and kept all appliances to the adjacent wall. This preserved as much floor space as possible, and had the added benefit of retaining the original locations for the plumbing, gas lines, and ducted extractor—no permits to file or added expense of rerouting. We wanted a minimal aesthetic—black and white. Ultimately, we took our cues from a soapstone countertop we saw on a Sweeten blog <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. After visiting M. Teixeira’s amazing warehouse, we chose a stone that had a lot of green undertones in the black base. For the cabinet paints, we decided on an extremely dark black-green shade, and a cool white to complement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This space ended up being a special project in the apartment. While our contractor&#8217;s team completed the major work—prepping the walls, installing wood flooring, adding lighting, installing the appliances and sink, and tiling the backsplash—Arthur and I ended up building the rest of the kitchen ourselves (!) using Ikea base cabinets that we modified and custom fronts. We also decided to just paint the fronts ourselves. (*Note: after doing it and coming out the other side, this is NOT recommended. However, if you have the time, patience and space, you will save a lot.) For those of you interested in the details: We needed to paint 26 panels—some over ten ft tall—inside the apartment because, well, that’s the only space we had. Working in stages, we brushed two coats per side, sanded, vacuumed and wiped down with a tack cloth between each coat. And our two cats meant even more obsessive vacuuming and confining them to the bedroom for most of the full month it took to paint—the threat of fur was everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21429 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21441 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, our excellent foreman, Al, demolished a loft bed, and combined the small bedroom closet with an adjacent coat closet. We’ve hung a full-height curtain, so we can use every last inch of the ceiling height for storage. The entry door from the living room into the bedroom was moved toward the kitchen. Previously, it was right in the middle of a living room wall, making that room very difficult to furnish. The team expertly restored the plaster walls, and matched new wood flooring inside the closet area and kitchen with the original (our contractor really pulled through with that find!). New moldings were also seamlessly integrated in areas that had been exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21430 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21435 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21443 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21432" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom skews warmer in tone than the kitchen, and was designed as a spare and sleek space. We replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—and rain shower head to keep the lines clean and open up the room. (This required an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/business/laa.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAA permit</a>, which called for a master plumber.) A wing wall keeps all the water from splashing out, and conceals a recessed shelf for products. The contractor&#8217;s team—Al specifically—were truly master tilers. We chose a tiny copper ceramic mosaic for the floor, shower curb and base, and creamy white, elongated tile for the walls. The grout is a warm brown that picks up on the terracotta edges of the white tile and the copper tones of the floor tile. We, of course wanted every joint to match and it does. We opted for a large recessed mirrored medicine cabinet to contain clutter and a wall-mounted sink with no cabinet. Everything fits except the hairdryer, which lives in the credenza directly outside of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it’s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our Sweeten contractor, Al and the team. They were a pleasure to work with throughout and we’d love to collaborate again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you so much, Arthur and Kate, for sharing your story. It’s always intriguing to hear about a home renovation from the point of view of architects! We hope you enjoy your new home.</em></p>

<p>Racing to line up an ambitious renovation before closing on a dated co-op in Woodside, Queens, Maria, a financial reporting director at a major media company, and Eric, the owner and Creative Director at broadcast design studio <a href="https://www.generalidea.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Idea</a>, expected “pain and horror” as first-time renovators. They’d linked up with an architectural designer and came to Sweeten to find a general contractor to overhaul all 850 square feet of their new two-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>Some of the finishes were just plain uninspired, while other layout and fixture details limited a more holistic use of the space. Laminate counters and discolored floor tiles anchored the kitchen, warped cupboards demanded a good nudge to shut completely, and the small bathroom’s ornate pedestal sink went way overboard on frilly decorative details while way under-delivering on countertop real estate.</p>

<h3>Creating a team</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goals were pretty straightforward: open up the enclosed kitchen to the living room, update the kitchen and bathroom, and refinish the floors. Still, their designer, <a href="https://www.vidachang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vida</a>, brought three critical points of view to the project. One was technical and practical: to limit work to the existing structural and plumbing layout so that the crew could focus on visible details that mattered most. The second was connectedness: Vida posted the project on Sweeten to find local contractors matched to the project’s budget and scope, freeing her up to focus on design solutions. And the third was creative: clean design details and a minimalist style found in matte finishes, simple profiles, and rich walnut wood warmth. They were matched with their Sweeten contractor for demolition, rebuilding, and craftsmanship detail down to the new doorknobs.</p>

<h3>A gallery kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maria and Eric wanted an open, bright space with clean lines. They had drawn up a 3D model on their own to convey big ideas, and worked closely with Vida to fine-tune, leaning toward Scandinavian sensibilities with some mid-century modern touches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor&#8217;s team took on the kitchen wall, which sectioned the galley kitchen off in its own corner. To give Eric and Maria the open feeling they wanted, the designs called for approaching the two galley walls strategically. On one side, countertop prep space takes the lead, wrapping around the kitchen wall and extending into the living room with low walnut cabinet storage. Skipping the usual line of upper cabinets in this spot helps keep the living room open through to the kitchen’s window. On the opposite wall, full-height cabinets concentrate storage but still keep a low profile with matte white finishes and concealed hardware. The stainless Bosch appliances and a striking black sink and faucet combo star in this otherwise simple space.</p>

<h3>Making a space space feel bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom’s small footprint led the team to focus on storage solutions and a simple palette. High contrast black and white materials, a frameless mirror, matte black plumbing fixtures (even under the wall mount sink!), and recessed wall storage gave Eric and Maria a bright and uncluttered retreat. The floor tile was admittedly a splurge, but with just a few square feet of coverage needed, it made sense to focus a high-end finish in that small spot.</p>

<h3>Updated floors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room and bedrooms, the team stripped walls and focused on restoring the existing wood flooring. Getting the floors right was a challenge. Aiming for a serene, matte oiled finish required the team to strip the previous stain and try out a few approaches with a new topcoat. The new finish, a layer of natural sheen, is an updated take on the original material.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-53574 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06.jpg" alt="white on wood bedroom design" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Bumps in the road</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maria and Eric planned to use the second bedroom as a home office and needed to reframe the entry to open it up to the living room. The custom pocket door is their favorite design detail, a necessary addition after finding an unexpected structural beam which could have prevented the plans for a floor-to-ceiling entry. Vida suggested encasing the beam in walnut, with an asymmetrical line. It&#8217;s a beautiful and unique solution that helps tie in design touches from each room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-53585 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17.jpg" alt="open bright living room" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With their expert team in place, Maria and Eric found that communication was key. They had detailed conversations about measurements, finishes, and placement prior to work starting, saving time and headaches. Their contractor&#8217;s team helped keep the project on track and were key partners in addressing issues that came up as work progressed. Vida kept balance and prioritization top of mind to negotiate cost, quality, and lead times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And behind the scenes at Sweeten, we saw in-progress photos of those show-stopping black fixtures when the Sweeten contractor checked in with updates throughout the project (with Queens cheesecake hand-delivered on a visit to our offices!). What a complete treat for us to be able to show off all of this beautiful finished work!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When a design editor and curator came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate the kitchen and bathroom in her 1910 Greenwich Village industrial loft, we were psyched to see what she would do with the remnants of a 1970s condo conversion and eager to see how a design professional would (presumably) breeze through her own renovation. We most definitely did end up with a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom after we introduced this homeowner to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Aleks</a>, but we also landed some especially insightful lessons learned along the way. We&#8217;ll keep our source secret because she works in the industry, but here are three renovation lessons from a sweetened kitchen and bathroom that everyone should know.</p>
<p><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/3-renovation-lessons-learned-from-a-greenwich-village-designer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14579" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg" alt="kitchen and bath renovation " width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14565"></span></p>
<h3>1. Visit the showrooms, but buy online.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The insider tip from this renovation is that you have to combine high-tech and low-tech research methods to make decisions and purchases. Products are endlessly available from a huge variety of sources and it&#8217;s worth visiting showrooms and stone yards to see and touch the materials that will be in your home for years, but the best prices for most materials can be found online. Even with architect and designer discounts, this design pro found that most purchases were cheaper online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One potential downside of skipping the brick and mortar ordering experience is that you are dealing with a wide variety of sources across many appliances and fixtures. The word from our insider is to apply some good old-fashioned patience and diligence in dealing with different customer service contacts, but also take very clear pictures of labels and serial numbers and specs in case you need to correct an order or source any additional tiny parts. Keep your cool as materials arrive by cataloguing electronic records and photos of all of the pieces, with serial numbers visible in your photos, so that you can instantly source what you need as deliveries fall into place. These records will also help you document any problems you do run into with vendors and will give you a much clearer path to resolving issues big and small.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Learn your way around IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our industry source looked at lots of kitchen cabinetry options and found that the high-end route was astronomically expense. Frustratingly, the next tier down was slightly more budget-friendly, but not enough to mask the difference in construction quality. IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system required admittedly time-consuming weeknight trips and weekend excursions, but investing time and learning her way around their design software yielded a great set of cabinets and a modern look at a much lower price point. &#8220;Brace yourself and crack IKEA&#8221; in her words!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with any order, you should have your contractor confirm measurements and weigh in on the pieces you pick before you order. Your contractor is your full partner in the renovation &#8211; even if you have the patience to teach yourself to use IKEA&#8217;s design system, your contractor will figure out ways to make things work and help you pass obstacles you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see coming.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Stay close by and check in often.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re going with a major renovation and need to stay elsewhere while the work is underway, it&#8217;s really important to be close by and check in often. Even with all of the advance planning and ordering and designing that goes in to the process, there are decisions being made on the ground at every stage and you want to be a part of it. It&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re supervising the work or preventing mistakes, it&#8217;s that there are small decisions and many paths that the team will go down, and you can have an impact as design translates into build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talk to your contractor about when visits make sense and be a regular thought partner in the progress. Our insider also encouraged renovators to be kind to themselves and to their contractors: be prepared for mistakes &#8211; the wrong color, the wrong size, and unforeseen adjustments are an inevitable part of a complex and custom process. Forgive yourself and build in the emotional and scheduling contingencies to address mistakes and keep moving forward.</p>
