<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by homeowner Jessica</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We purchased the apartment with intentions to renovate. We both love architecture and design, and we wanted a place that we could make our own. The previous apartment, with its sunny balcony and endless closet space, had given us high standards, and working in real estate, I look at beautiful homes all the time. We wanted a home where we could make our mark and add the elements we craved.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43743 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12.jpg" alt="homeowners in their newly renovated living room" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We were thrilled when we landed on this one-bedroom apartment, in a 1930s Chelsea co-op. The building had great bones and Art Deco details but the apartment needed work. We’d been following Sweeten, and after closing, when we knew the reno was imminent, we looked to the service for direction. </span><span class="s2">We wanted to create a clean, modern space marrying traditional and contemporary design elements accented with our personal twists. Throughout, we planned to incorporate art and photos from our travels.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Living in</span><span class="s2"> the apartment for about half a year and bringing</span><span class="s1"> our Sweeten contractor onboard brought the project into focus. We wanted to rethink the closet layouts and planned to </span><span class="s4">update the living room’s custom built-ins</span><span class="s1">. We were also looking for a lighting solution since the courtyard-facing unit didn’t get much natural light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last but certainly not least, we planned to improve the kitchen and the </span><span class="s4">bathroom</span><span class="s1">. </span><span class="s2">A</span><span class="s1">dditional cosmetic and electrical updates included new doors and hardware and USB outlets throughout the apartment. Our contractor was patient, listening to our thoughts (lots of them), answering questions and—most of all—assuring us that he could get the job done, within our time constraints and with the level of quality we were hoping for.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">A narrow galley kitchen? Yes. And we love it.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Closets and storage came first. We’d known when we purchased the apartment that we were in for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major storage deficit</a>. With our contractor’s help, we found we could reconfigure the hall and bedroom closets, which backed up to one another. We moved the interior wall, creating a larger bedroom closet with</span><span class="s2"> French doors (sliding doors can restrict access)</span><span class="s1">. Downsizing the hallway closet felt like a sacrifice, but we outfitted the space for linen-and-shoe storage—useful and enviable extras in NYC.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43739 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="washer dryer in kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The kitchen was one room where plans changed. It had been renovated and we hadn’t planned on a gut-job. We love to cook and entertain, and didn’t want to forego full-sized appliances, but we wanted more cupboard and counter space. </span><span class="s5">We ultimately did a full rip-and-replace</span><span class="s1">. The cabinets are </span><span class="s5">an </span><span class="s1">off-the-shelf pick that we stacked to the ceiling; it was like putting together a giant puzzle, but was good for our budget and timeline, and gave us a ton of storage. The cabinet above the dishwasher was a last-minute call to increase pantry space. </span><span class="s5">Q</span><span class="s1">uartz countertops and </span><span class="s5">a slab backsplash </span><span class="s1">give us a marble look without the maintenance</span><span class="s5">. </span><span class="s1">A narrow galley kitchen? Yes. And we love it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The </span><span class="s4">old &#8217;70s </span><span class="s2">bathroom remained, and it </span><span class="s1">was a full demo and redo</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">We replaced the peach and yellow bathroom tile, </span><span class="s2">which appeared to be original to the </span><span class="s1">building, with marble subway tile, </span><span class="s2">placed vertically for some spin. We played with metals, choosing</span><span class="s1"> an unexpected iron vanity (the countertop is quartz) and chrome hardware. </span><span class="s2">The floor tiles are porcelain, sleek and durable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="s2">The rear-facing apartment was pin-drop quiet, but dark. The silence was </span>a luxury to us, having endured roaring sunrise garbage pickups and the revelry of late-night barhoppers. But the long living room, which also comprises the dining area, had just two windows and<span class="s2"> no built-in light fixtures. </span>We installed recessed LED lighting in this room and it brightened the area so perfectly that we added it in the bedroom, the bath and, finally, the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The existing built-in cabinets spanning the windowed wall in the living room</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">provided additional storage and brightened up the room with a fresh coat of white paint. We removed a floating center unit to accommodate a wall-mount TV. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To finish, our Sweeten contractor detailed with all new doors and hardware and added t</span><span class="s5">hose USB outlets, which become more useful every day. </span><span class="s1">It was our idea to hang wallpaper in the foyer; the subtle raffia gives the walls texture and depth. We chose materials that would stand the test of time from both an aesthetic and durability standpoint. But it was so helpful to have an expert to guide us. There are a ton of vendors out there and our contractor had relationships with suppliers and experience with almost <a href="https://youtu.be/cr3uihyuiUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any material available</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our advice as first-timers is to do the research and know what you want but keep an open mind! </span><span class="s1">Seeing the work progress day-over-day and week-over-week was amazing, a</span><span class="s5">nd we’re so thrilled with the outcome! </span><span class="s1">Adding our stamp to this place was fun and fulfilling. What a great feeling!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Jessica and Alex, for sharing your story!</i></span></p>

Depending on the type of structure, you may still have the option to remedy the situation. Here we lay out the details on how to add a washer and dryer: space, building approval, permits, electrical, and plumbing.</p><h3><strong>What do you need?</strong></h3><p><strong>Space—</strong>This may be obvious, but there isn’t always room in tiny NYC apartments for one! You can get creative—take a look at the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryers in apartments</a> that Sweeten homeowners have come up with for ideas. You may want to build a closet, tuck it under a kitchen counter, or hide it away inside cabinetry.</p><p><strong>Building approval—</strong>This only applies to apartment buildings. Many buildings have no “wet-over-dry” rules, so it’s best to choose a spot inside a “wet zone” in the apartment. Good locations include inside the kitchen or bathroom or directly next to one of those rooms. It will also be easier to route plumbing this way. Buildings usually stack the wet zones in a vertical line. Putting a washer and dryer in your bedroom closet wouldn&#8217;t be permitted even if there’s room for one. You’ll have to submit an architect’s plan for review by your board. Many Sweeten contractors can refer an architect <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">if your project requires one</a>.</p><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27425 size-chrono" title="laundry room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER-723x482.jpg" alt="how to add a washer and dryer , installing a washer and dryer, laundry, renovation, remodel, design, and construction" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><em>(Above) </em>Cristiana&#8217;s front-loading machines in her Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">basement renovation</a></p><p><strong>City permits</strong>—If you are adding new electrical and plumbing, you’ll need proper city permits for either a house or an apartment.</p><p><strong>Electrical capacity—</strong>Per typical building codes, the electrician will need to install an AFCI, which is a circuit breaker that will prevent electrical fires. However, you’ll also need to confirm with a licensed pro that your home has the electrical capacity to handle the additional load. This goes for both a house and an apartment.</p><p><strong>New plumbing and electrical—</strong>A licensed plumber and electrician will need to route new lines. If you go with a gas dryer, the plumber will install a new gas line as well as water lines for the washer.</p><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Washer-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37043 size-full" title="under-counter washing machine" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Washer-03.jpg" alt="how to add a washer and dryer , installing a washer and dryer, laundry, renovation, remodel, design, and construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Washer-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Washer-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Washer-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a> <em>(Above) </em>Sweeten homeowner Marissa installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-fit-for-the-lights-on-broadway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2-in-1 combo washer dryer</a></p><h3><strong>Getting approval to add a washer/dryer</strong></h3><p>If you live in an apartment building—whether it’s a co-op or a condo—check the alteration agreement and house rules for adding a washer and dryer. Some buildings expressly prohibit it, others will allow existing units to be grandfathered in but will not permit new ones. A select number will allow it with the proper approvals and permits. “If your building doesn&#8217;t allow the installation of a washer and dryer, don&#8217;t take it personally,” said New York/New Jersey Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a> Majid. “There is a logical reason why. Older buildings have limited plumbing capacities that adding a washer may overwhelm. There is a higher risk of leakage and overflow as well as the potential for water or fire damage.</p><p>Most boards won&#8217;t accept the risk or liability&#8221; and won&#8217;t allow it if the building is not already equipped for it. For this reason, it’s also not advisable to add one without approval. Should your unapproved appliances malfunction and damage units adjacent to or beneath yours, you’ll be responsible. If you live in a house that you own, there should be no problem since there are no boards to notify. In a rental, you’ll have to discuss it with your landlord, who may be willing to add one at his/her discretion.</p><h3><b>How much does a laundry room remodel cost?</b></h3><p>It will cost more to add a washer and dryer to a city apartment than it will in a house. “There are additional variables that get factored into the estimate,” Majid says. Contractors will consider the parking situation, the limits on working hours permitted by the building, and the greater liability of working in a multi-unit building.</p><p>Majid also suggests that compact, stackable washers and dryers (electric and ventless) are the most suitable choices for apartment living. In the city, homeowners should budget $7,000 to $15,000 on average for a new washer and dryer, which takes many variables into play. The higher end of the range includes creating a closet for the appliances. In a house, because there are fewer complexities, the price range is lower: approximately $3,000 to $5,000 should get the job done. The higher-end includes building a space or room to house the units.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42269" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-09.gif" alt="Washer and dryer" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><em>(Above) </em>Gina + Andrew stack a washer and dryer in their Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a></p><h3><strong>How long does it take to install a washer and dryer at home?</strong></h3><p>In terms of construction and labor, a good estimate is 3-5 days. The plumber will need a day, the electrician will need a day, and then you may need a day for relocations as well as to close up the wall. On day four, you’ll be able to paint, once it’s dry, install the new washer/dryer (day five).</p><h3><b>What permits and approvals do I need before installing a washer/dryer?</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are adding any new plumbing or electrical wiring, you’ll need a permit from the city. If you live in an apartment building, you’ll probably need approval from your condo or co-op board, even if it’s a simple installation. Be sure to check house rules before hiring an architect to draw up plans. </span></p><p>If you are already considering a renovation elsewhere in your home, adding this to your scope is a good idea if you’re able to meet the criteria above.

City dwellers will pay more for a laundry room remodel than suburbanites. On average, city-area homeowners should budget $7,000—$15,000 for a new washer and dryer. The higher end of this range includes creating a closet for the appliances. In a house, because there are fewer complexities, the price range for a laundry room remodel is lower; approximately $3,000—$5,000.</p></div>
