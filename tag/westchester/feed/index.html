</ul>
<h3>Moving mom closer to family</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to having her son, Alissa had worked in fashion and had a good eye for style, design, and finding a great value. So when it came time for her mom, Tatiana, to find, gut, and renovate an apartment, the two teamed up to take on the condo renovation in Westchester. Tatiana was both downsizing and moving from Port Washington, in Long Island, to be closer to her grandchildren. She concentrated her search in southern Westchester, about 30 minutes outside New York City. Alissa and her family live in Bedford, NY, so that location would provide easy access.</p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mother-daughter duo prioritized location and a great building with amenities, and also looked specifically for a rundown space so that they could do a full gut condo renovation. Tatiana also wanted a condo rather than a co-op; in case she ever wanted to rent out the property in the future, she didn’t want to deal with strict building rules and sublet policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment they settled on was a one-bed, one-bath condo measuring 975 square feet, located in Hartsdale, NY, in a condo complex with a pool, clubhouse, and gym. The apartment itself was outdated and the kitchen and bath were original to the building when it went up in the late &#8217;70s. Alissa <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> and the pair chose to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. Her mom closed on the unit and began the condo renovation in Westchester just a week later. Everything had to go—the floors and carpets, popcorn ceilings, walls, doors, and the entire bath and kitchen.</p>
<h3>Handling and ordering materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa and Tatiana decided that they would <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order all of the materials themselves</a>, so they could search for good values and have full control over the final look. Alissa explained, “We knew exactly the vision we wanted for the spaces. Working in fashion and living in NYC my whole life, I was able to go direct to the wholesale districts and find the best deals on items like the fixtures and other materials. This gave us leftover money to splurge on designer furniture and lighting!” The contractor took care of the demo, installation, and provided rough construction materials.</p>
<h3>Merging construction and style</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“My mom is very stylish and vibrant; we wanted to create a bright, airy contemporary space to match her style,&#8221; said Alissa. &#8220;We went for neutral gray tones with splashes of color.” In the living room, they chose a calming gray for the walls and floor-to-ceiling curtains, accessorizing with gold-toned finishes and brass furniture. A leather couch offers a grounding contrast to the animal print rug—both on-trend and grandchild-friendly. Dark gray wood flooring and Jonathan Adler lighting are seen throughout the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a more affordable solution, the contractor covered the popcorn ceiling with a one-quarter-inch layer of sheetrock rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoothing out the texture</a>, which would have been time-consuming and costly.</p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h3>Kid-friendly materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tatiana wanted her apartment to be “dressed” in a way that resembled her personal style: classic with a flair. In the kitchen, this meant going with a clean, bright white. Shaker cabinet fronts with nickel hardware were selected for their simplicity and mixed with open shelving as well as glass fronts. Stainless steel appliances complete the look. White and gray porcelain tile on the floor mimicked the look of marble without the price tag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining area, the mother-daughter duo was thrilled to find leather chairs in a bold cobalt blue at a Lillian August SONO outlet in Connecticut. Durable and wipeable, they are perfect for visiting grandchildren and sit around a dining table under a silver drum pendant light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They painted Tatiana’s bedroom in warm ivory tones, with blush pink velvet curtains and a comfortable armchair. The colors are calming, and the high-gloss sheen they chose for the paint “gives the walls a very lush feel and works really well with all the velvet,” said Alissa.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34252 mb-0 size-chrono" title="open-glass-panel-door-in-foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" alt="open glass panel door in the foyer opening to a white room after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The serene bathroom is in a similar color palette to the kitchen. The marble tile floors and walls complement a white vanity that has plenty of drawer space. Alissa and Tatiana accessorized the space with woven covered baskets for storage and to add a bit of warmth. They also reglazed the original bathtub and added a glass shower divider to remove the need for a shower curtain.</p>
<h3>Alissa&#8217;s renovation tip: Measure your appliances—and then measure again!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa shared with us a hiccup in the process: “Funny story—this was such an amateur move! Before the renovation started, we were online looking at kitchen appliances, got overly excited, and bought a refrigerator without taking the measurements first. My mom picked out the BIGGEST double refrigerator, thinking it would fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the appliances were delivered, the refrigerator did not fit through the front door! It was so annoying—the store had to take it back, and then we had to take very careful measurements and select another style to satisfy the space. After that incident, we measured and re-measured before making a purchase!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite that obstacle, the Sweeten contractor met the deadlines and even delivered the apartment a few days early. Since the project&#8217;s completion, Tatiana reports that “the new space is amazing, and I never want to leave!”</p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing your Westchester condo renovation with us, Tatiana!</em></p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45098 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45113 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="Yonkers family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg" alt="drip dishware collection" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg" alt="kitchen display ideas" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45105" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen with natural wood cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>

<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>

<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Amanda and Cory, for sharing your Colonial home remodel story with us!</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a master bathroom in Pelham, New York</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In advance of moving into their newly purchased Pelham home, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom in Westchester, Alexy and her husband decided to get some necessary renovations out of the way. The couple had a five-year-old and were pregnant with their second child. They were still living in Brooklyn, which made this reno project one that would be done from afar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The house only had showers, which aren’t ideal for bathing infants. They decided to add a tub to the second-floor bathroom, which had already undergone a renovation by the previous owner that had stolen some space from the neighboring bedroom. “The bedroom closet was just a few inches deep with some shelves,” Alexy said. There was also the absence of a linen closet on the second floor. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Alexy was familiar with Sweeten from the service&#8217;s many renovations in Brooklyn, but didn&#8217;t know any general contractors in Westchester. She needed to find one she could trust since the house would be empty. They tried to get to Pelham on weekends to check on the work even though Alexy was nine months pregnant.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor they chose</a> took space from the hallway to add a large linen closet to the bathroom. &#8220;It holds a lot, and that is exactly what I wanted,” said Alexy. The redistributed hallway space also provided the extra room needed to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> to the shower area. Alexy’s husband originally wanted a double vanity, but there just wasn’t enough room. After much soul-searching, he decided what he really wanted was adequate counter space. The vanity they went with had a counter that stretched to the wall while adding more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> underneath.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by Westchester homeowner Brian McFarland</em></p>
<h3>The 14-year wait for a kitchen and bath renovation</h3>
<p>We spent nearly 14 years in our house before taking on this renovation. We had talked about it for years, and finally just grew too tired of trying to hold the existing kitchen and powder room together as parts kept failing or wearing out. Really, the kitchen was on Tracey’s list from the time we first made an offer on the house. The property is a 2,300-square-foot home constructed in 1920. It’s not very typical of any identifiable style, but if a realtor were listing it, they’d probably misidentify it as a Colonial.</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flow of the ground floor of our house was a mix of the original ‘20s layout and alterations made in the last 20 to 30 years. Circulation was difficult and space-consuming. Also, the prior kitchen alterations were done with materials that had now outlived their reasonable life cycle. It had always wanted to be re-done and now it finally would be.</p>
<h3>Finding a general contractor for their renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22786">posted our project</a> to Sweeten, we didn’t have a clear vision of a specific look or style—at least not a consensus. The focus was to simplify and yield more functional space. It was also important to create a working side of the eat-in area of the kitchen with storage and a pantry. We planned to keep the appliances but wanted new countertops, cabinets, floors, and backsplash. In an effort to improve flow, we also knocked down walls in a coat closet area and moved the powder room. Lastly, we planned to close up an exterior door that was never used. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We chose this Sweeten contractor</a> for the job with me doing the planning and sourcing of most of the materials, while Tracey handled most of the day-to-day communications with the contractor.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were most excited about getting rid of the ceramic tile floor. It really was evil. Every time we cleaned it, it got dirtier.</p></blockquote>
<h3>A rocky (but successful) start to the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The demolition was scheduled to begin on the first day of our summer vacation. We thought that the Village was going to permit that based on materials that had already been provided to them. We heard from our contractor that he needed signed-and-sealed drawings even to begin demolition. I served as the architect on our project and happened to be in Virginia Beach at the time. I really should have known better. Luckily, being the son of a fireman and a one-time Boy Scout, I’m always prepared for an architectural emergency. What architect worth his eyeglasses goes on vacation without his seal (and, yes, stamp pad) and an external drive with his current projects? After all, nowadays, you can architect from anywhere with an iPhone, Google Maps, and Kinko’s/FedEx.</p>

<h3>Planning the kitchen color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blue is Tracey’s favorite color. We went through the Benjamin Moore fan deck looking for blues and expected to do a custom color. It turned out that Omega’s blue stock color for the cabinets was very close to a paint color swatch that we had chosen. We were very pleased to be able to save extra time and money. Originally, Tracey said she was thinking white upper cabinets and blue lower cabinets with wood floors, but I wanted something more uniform. In the end, we chose blue cabinets for both the upper and lower cabinets, but with a white interior and glass fronts, so we each got a little of what we wanted.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the story behind the kitchen floor tile?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were most excited about getting rid of the ceramic tile floor. It really was evil. Every time we cleaned it, it got dirtier. We tried an exorcist but, apparently, they don’t do floors. It certainly didn’t help that it was more of a painted clay tile than a glazed ceramic tile. Underneath the thin beige-y surface coat was a red clay body, and the finished surface didn’t have anywhere near the tensile strength to overcome the flex in the floor that had been caused by some crude cuts made in the joists below in a prior alteration. Not only was the surface always dirty, but there were always red clay particles roaming around the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had fallen in love with a Porcelanosa tile pattern in blue shades. Tracey said she was surprised as it was completely outside the box of what she expected me to pick. She loved it—and now loves it even more because it doesn&#8217;t show any dirt, she says. We both love the new sink base with deep drawers, in lieu of cabinet doors. No more bending and fishing through the growing variety of cleaning supplies hiding deep in the back of the cabinet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> is Tracey’s favorite part of the renovation. Hands down. She’s so proud of it, she keeps the door open all the time. And I close it every time I go by.</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wallpaper-for-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powder room</a>, we went with a pocket door as a space-saving solution. We chose simple grey flooring, a compact modern sink, and a single hanging pendant. My favorite part of the renovation is the simplicity of the powder room with the glazed door, and the large window in it. Its remote location provides all the privacy it needs.</p>
<h3>Surviving the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Importantly, Sweeten helped us find the right contractor, especially by knowing when to suggest, “Maybe if you increase your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> a bit….” The recurring calls by account managers to monitor progress were welcome evidence that Sweeten maintained an interest in the project being delivered successfully. Our Sweeten contractor did just what he needed to do and treated the project as a business venture, whereas we behaved as if it was our home and we wanted it to be just right. He always knew when to suggest a solution to coax a decision, and retained a remarkably even temper throughout, even when we probably didn’t deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of advice to future renovators: decide EVERYTHING before you start. Trust me, there will be things you never even dreamed of, so the last thing you need is an outstanding to-do list when tradesmen are in your house, swinging tools, asking you new questions every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We feel our renovation was an even more dramatic change than we had expected. The whole flow of the house is better. Believe it or not, we see our teenagers more because the kitchen is now a pleasant, comfortable place where they sometimes linger for a few minutes before retreating back to their rooms. The only way I could be happier with it was if it was free!</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Tracey and Brian, for sharing your long-awaited renovation with us!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Two weeks after closing on a Tudor-style townhouse built in 1926—with 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and 1,800 square feet of living space—the homeowners decided that the kitchen renovation would have to happen sooner rather than later. The sense of urgency was propelled by the fact that many of the appliances didn’t work. There were also the ‘70s-era finishes to consider; dark brown cabinets, beige countertops, and vinyl flooring. Planning a gut renovation, the homeowners decided to maintain as much of the existing layout as possible. On the list of must-haves were new cabinets, fresh tile, and updated appliances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Ready to renovate, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. The original placement of the sink under the window made sense, but the placement of the cooktop and double oven—on opposite sides of the kitchen—was inefficient. Plus, with the dining room next door, the built-in dining nook was unnecessary and took up valuable real estate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/kitchen-renovation-cost-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32996 size-chrono" title="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-1-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although storage wasn’t an issue, the couple decided to add a line of cabinets to the right wall to match the line of cabinets on the opposite side, bringing symmetry to the kitchen layout. White, Shaker-style cabinets were installed along the upper line with a set of gray cabinets beneath them. The backsplash was replaced with white subway tile that reaches the ceiling for a seamless appearance while <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slate floor tile</a> adds rich contrast to the overall neutral palette. The finished space also received the much-needed (working!) new appliances, including a range.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Update a galley kitchen in Westchester County, NY</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Two decades after moving into her 1912 co-op in the town of Eastchester, Nancy felt her galley kitchen was due for a dramatic overhaul. What she craved was a brighter, more contemporary-looking kitchen. True, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley layout</a> was functional, with plenty of room for generous-sized appliances and two vast expanses of prep space. Yet, it was precisely those long stretches of surfaces that caused the room to feel outdated. The speckled laminate countertop clashed with the original wood cabinets, while the wood floor was an awkward marriage of half oak and half pine—both with time-worn stain finishes. Anxious to get an improvement underway, she posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and chose her Sweeten contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30442 mb-0 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Having used the kitchen for 20 years, Nancy remained satisfied with the original cabinets and the placement of appliances. She began the renovation with the selection of a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> and floor that would reflect her vision of a calm, minimalist cook space. She knew she wanted Caesarstone for its durability and easy maintenance, and fell in love with a pale gray that harmonized with the stainless steel appliances that she had installed a few years earlier. Underfoot, “I always wanted a black floor,” she says. Crisp black ceramic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> answered her wish. The small hexagonal tile shape adds a subtle pattern while the extensive grout lines help keep the surface nonslip. New black knobs, found on Amazon for the cabinets, visually connect the pale wood with the tile and lend a touch of drama.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the backsplash, Nancy opted for a white ceramic subway tile, keeping with the original era of the kitchen and its cabinets. A new undermount stainless steel sink and sculptural single-lever faucet with matching soap dispenser tie in with the existing appliances to underscore the sleek, simple look she was after. A coat of paint for the walls and radiator and new toe kicks under the cabinets complete the surface transformation. The result: A kitchen with a fresh outlook that’s still at home in its surroundings.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Keeping the cabinets and appliances in place allowed Nancy to invest in the materials—countertop, floor tile—that she had her heart set on. The rip-and-replace renovation also meant minimal disruption, and the contractor finished the job exactly when he said he would.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the summer of 2017, Brooke and Paul closed on a 1924 Mediterranean-style home in Pelham, New York. The couple, already living in town, was drawn to the location of the house, perched on a picturesque hillside cul-de-sac in a neighborhood full of young families like their own. The property was designed by architect Guy Mariner, who arrived in Pelham in the early 20th century, making his mark on the suburb&#8217;s historic residential homes and landmarked structures. Their &#8220;new&#8221; old home featured exposed oak beams, beautiful archways, and a barrel-tiled roof—not to mention original faience tiles and leaded-glass windows. The space was almost perfect for them, their kids—Charlotte, Francie, and Teddy—and their two black Labs, Hattie and Reed. There were a few changes that needed to be made to accommodate their busy daily routine.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Their previous home had an expansive, open kitchen with a large island that encouraged casual family gatherings, and it was the go-to spot for baking, art and crafts, and Play-Doh sculptures. In this new house, the kitchen was closed off from the dining room and had lower ceilings. The cabinetry was warped, and the island was “too small for our family of five to gather around,” Brooke explains. The design choices in the kitchen did not match the rest of the house, and the duo wished for an aesthetic befitting the historic architecture of the home while addressing the practical and busy lifestyle of an active family. &#8220;We wanted to create a kitchen that would be functional for everyone to be in without feeling crowded,&#8221; she said. Additionally, the master bath needed a major facelift: a pedestal sink provided no storage and the ancient tub had to go. The pair <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. They were quickly matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>, who they asked to design and install the kitchen, along with a new vanity in the master bath.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooke and Paul embarked on the renovation process without having first lived in the home, which presented some challenges. They weren’t sure how they would use the space, but they did know that they wanted adequate storage, a more open kitchen/dining area, and a large island. Their Sweeten contractor took this information and came up with a solution that incorporated their wishlist. First, they took down the wall separating the dining room and the kitchen and added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large island</a> in its place. “It was also very important to me to have an island that curved out so that when we gathered around to eat, we weren’t in a straight line,” says Brooke.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/kitchen-renovation-cost-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32996 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-1-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the age of the house, the ceiling in the kitchen was quite low and not level. They would have lost two inches if they attempted to level the entire surface. The solution: their contractor carefully integrated the cabinets within the out-of-level areas and cut the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moldings</a> in a certain way to give the appearance of an even ceiling. Brooke tells us, “I struggled with designing a kitchen that I hadn’t lived in before, but our Sweeten contractor was great to work with; he blended my suggestions into his designs and I’m thrilled with how it turned out.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple also chose to install a microwave drawer (a favorite), an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extra-large fridge</a>, and two refrigerator drawers just for beverages. Brooke reports that she loves her blue patterned tile backsplash, a splurge that really embraces the Mediterranean architecture of the home. She went with marble for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>; after examining other options, she couldn’t find a substitute that would give the feel she was looking for. A soft gray paint complemented the white cabinetry and blue island. The configuration of the new kitchen, which not only combined the dining room but also opened up the existing butler’s pantry, created a better flow and an easier space for the family to congregate. A custom L-shaped dining bench, topped with cheerful blue and yellow pillows, was the final touch to a warm, happy space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bath, their Sweeten contractor was tasked with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a vanity</a> that could hold a laundry hamper as well as toiletries and other daily necessities. He worked with the small footprint, since moving the plumbing fixtures would have meant going over budget. In the end, however, Brooke and Paul took about a foot from an adjacent bedroom to fashion a slightly larger space. The new vanity is topped with marble and utilizes all the space available. A walk-in shower with pebbled tile floors replaced the old tub, and a bold custom blue paint was the final touch for a fresh new space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, Brooke shares one of her major lessons learned: Paint colors never look the way you expect them to. “I had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, ‘I didn’t know you were going green in the kitchen.’ So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32997 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Westchester County renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-2-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marrying an old house with modern life also meant taking time to figure out how the family wanted to live and use the space. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t been in our home for six months yet, so there&#8217;s still movement in how and where I store things as we get settled,&#8221; explains Brooke. During the demolition, they discovered a time capsule buried by previous owners containing a newspaper clipping dating from the first day of the Iraq War, as well as some information about the family and neighbors. And now, their own house history begins.</p>
