										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21669 size-large" title="fashion designer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg" alt="White bedroom" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">This Upper East Side apartment is now the perfect showcase for travel treasures and curated art collection</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18492" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s dispatch comes from the interior designer of a New York City apartment re-do. Samantha was brought on to help modernize a client’s apartment, and while she was up for leading the ambitious design needs, she needed help finding a general contractor who could execute beautifully on the plans. Her client had filled his home with art and travel finds over the course of four decades in the space, and what started as a “refresh” project evolved into a total apartment renovation to create a light and bright canvas for treasured pieces and cherished friends. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Samantha Stein, Interior Designer</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stars aligned when a good friend put me in touch with a potential client I’d known for years. Ron, the homeowner, had been living in the same Upper East Side post-war apartment for 40 years (!) and was ready for some interior changes to freshen it up. We met to discuss priorities and a design vision, and then turned to Sweeten for help choosing a contractor for </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were able to use Sweeten’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">network to narrow our contractor choice down to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one firm</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was experienced and great to work with. They had a reasonable price for our initial wish list, and after we began working with them, we grew more comfortable expanding into more custom solutions and additional scope, for what would ultimately become a full gut renovation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the theme of the renovation was a relatively minimal ‘refresh’ &#8211; new paint, strip and refinish floors, clean-up details such as the custom five inches of crown molding in the living room, add custom millwork covers for the old and dilapidated radiator units, and complete a full renovation of the very outdated kitchen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron, the client, wavered back and forth about updating his traditional apartment into a more modern space with an open-concept living and kitchen area. Ultimately, however, his classical taste and the way he uses the apartment in his daily life led us to leaving an enclosed kitchen, but updating its finishes and changing a few details to make the whole living area feel larger and flow more seamlessly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We removed both doors to the kitchen in favor of open entryways, demolished the two china cabinets that were edging into the dining space, and intended to continue the existing parquet into the kitchen. But, the more we discussed matching the existing parquet in rooms that had either outdated carpeting or badly damaged linoleum, the trickier it seemed it would be to get the clean, flowing feeling that Ron was looking for. After weighing costs and options with George&#8217;s team, we decided that going with a wide-plank engineered wood throughout the entire apartment (with the direction of the planks leading your eye out to the living room windows) was the right solution for a cohesive, flowing apartment. Ripping out the parquet allowed us to fully level and soundproof the subfloor, as well as fully waterproof the kitchen area. Great sighs of relief went up all around when the 40+ year old parquet and carpeting pieces were hauled out, and the textured wood floors (supplied by Glen Floors) look fantastic. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron has a fabulous lifelong collection of china, music, and incredible books on art, music, and travel that were hiding around the apartment. So, one of the top priorities for the renovation was storage. Curating a selected display of these items felt to me the best way to celebrate his travels and life experiences – they should be an integral part of the apartment without looking kitschy or messy. I had originally proposed a huge built-in wall of custom shelving and cabinetry, but pricey bids from other contractors made us step back. Once we started with George&#8217;s team, however, we felt confident we could bring back this concept to make up for the lost kitchen/dining storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We drew inspiration from several interiors that featured shelving surrounding a ‘nook’ for the sofa, and Michael and Dennis were able to help us flawlessly execute this vision with a stunning custom piece. The weight of the real wood doors, soft-close hinges, adjustable shelving, and hardware we selected from Nassau Suffolk Hardware make it all fit in perfectly—it’s hard to believe it wasn’t there before. We added two brass sconces from Ralph Lauren Home to softly light the sofa area at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="dark wood floors" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> </span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="traditional dining table" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was where the majority of the hard work happened. Our expert team was able to match my every demand. We re-centered the sink on the windows, removed a dropped ceiling section just above the windows, and gained upper cabinets by replacing the double wall ovens with a more conventional range. We saved a ton on appliances with some lucky timing with a big sale at Thermador, and chose a refrigerator, gas range, recirculating hood, and dishwasher from their Professional Series line. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom cabinets, again made from real wood, fit perfectly and are of incredible quality. We ordered the Kohler sink from Wayfair and the Rohl faucet from Nassau Suffolk Hardware. Our experts helped us choose Caesarstone quartz countertops instead of a pricier granite or marble, and we are impressed with their quality. Under-cabinet lighting and a few LEDs above the sink, in addition to the overhead fixture, make for lots of different ways to light the kitchen at night. The kitchen alone makes the entire apartment feel new and fresh, and its traditional accents (crown molding and the custom bevel on the countertops) keep it in the same design family as the rest of the apartment. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom and living room, we carefully selected vintage rugs to soften the newly wood-clad floors. Custom millwork radiator covers with picture-frame molding and Caesarstone tops replaced falling-apart metal enclosures for the A/C and heaters under the windows. Each has a powder-coated metal grill inset into the top and they act as gorgeous shelves to display a few more curios. These new units alone make the apartment look so much better! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Dennis also helped us outfit each of the seven closets in the apartment with custom shelving, so that we could reorganize all of Ron’s belongings to make more sense for his daily use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="custom radiator millwork covers" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18505" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="traditional bedroom aesthetic" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were so happy with their work that toward the end of the project, we even decided to hit on a long term wish list item for Ron: a deep-soaking tub in the master bath, and brand new shower and sink hardware (all from Rohl through Gracious Homes) in both bathrooms!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="rohl shower faucets" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18508" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="large format white shower tiles" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the full renovation took a lot of hard work, energy, and time. Ron loves showing off his new space and everyone is thrilled with the results. We’re grateful to the team at Sweeten for matching us with George and his crew, who were dependable and creative. They were flexible enough to work with us to incorporate lots of changes on the fly, and helped make our initial fantasy vision into a tangible reality.</span></p>

</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jamie, Queens homeowner  </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband and I dreamt of buying a brownstone in Bed-Stuy. This dream was apparently shared by everyone else in New York, because trying to find a place—any place—was a humbling experience in getting outbid by foreign investors and other first-time buyers with resources greater than ours. After a year of frustration, we found a condo in a recently remodeled brick building in Ridgewood, Queens—a quirky little Polish-Ecuadorian neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border that none of our friends had ever heard of. The good news was that the apartment was huge: the building’s original six units had been merged into three, giving us a yard and a finished basement to go with our ground-floor living space.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news was that the renovations had been undertaken in an aesthetic that my husband and I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">described as “late-life Euro bachelor”: dark wood fixtures and liberal use of large brown Tuscan tiles that gave certain rooms the yellowish air of an Adirondack rental property you’d regret renting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17412 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first year in Ridgewood was dominated by DIY projects—refacing cabinets, painting, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gardening—that improved the overall look of our apartment. The projects that remained were too complicated to be mastered through YouTube videos and trial-and-error, which put us on the market for a contractor to do some larger projects. First in line: our trainwreck of a master bathroom, which when we bought the apartment had been renovated in a very dark (read: creepy) and not-so-functional (read: the showerhead didn’t line up with the tub) way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our search for a contractor stretched over a year. I interviewed people from all over—recommendations from coworkers and friends of friends, names from Brownstoner’s community forum, references in interior design books. There was also Angie’s List, which was effective in introducing me to a series of contractors from Long Island and Brooklyn who were well-versed in bathrooms that featured lots of fogged glass and Jacuzzis—not the bright, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELLE</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Décor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-type vibe I was going for. These candidates would generally show up, late and complaining about parking in my neighborhood, then tell me how the fixtures I wanted were going to be too expensive for my budget, how they thought the current bathroom was fine as-is, how I should do a better job training my dogs not to bark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like a series of first dates that I knew were going to be awful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in the process I had read about Sweeten, but let’s be clear: I was far too jaded to be anything but skeptical. I went to their site and decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of sheer desperation. They first connected me with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and from day one, I was impressed. He showed up on time, listened carefully to what I was hoping to achieve, and demonstrated strong attention to detail, noticing things like the slope of the floors and the fact that the recessed lights were out of alignment. He was quick to turn around a quote (some contractors took weeks; others required me to follow up multiple times), and was very responsive to my many emails regarding questions and concerns. I took the leap and hired him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the start, working with Erion and his team was a delight. They showed up promptly at 9am each day, motivated and ready to begin work. And these guys worked hard! I swear, I barely saw them stop to eat! Construction debris and dust is part of the deal when you embark on a project like this, but Erion and his team were extremely tidy and took extra care to protect our house and hardwood floors. Even at the end of demo day, our house was surprisingly clean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of my experience with Erion was his openness to what I wanted and his tireless pursuit of making this a reality. I wanted a bright, clean, fresh, and timeless space—something that would age well with the house and provide a spa-like atmosphere. This bathroom has no natural light, so I made sure to choose materials that reflected light (beveled mirrors, polished nickel fixtures, high-gloss paint). Erion considered all my sourcing decisions, weighing in where I asked him to and letting me handle things everywhere else. I spent a lot of time researching the fixtures I wanted and although the approach was a bit piecemeal (and largely dictated by stores for which I had gift cards), it worked.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the tile we wanted to keep it light and clean and I worked with the lovely people at Ann Sacks. Their showroom is beautiful, pricing competitive, and customer service exceptional. On the bathroom floor, we chose large marble squares (16 x 16) with a honed finish because it’s not as slippery as polished marble and tends to show fewer scratches. We also decided to install radiant heat to keep our toes warm in winter. For the shower walls, I knew I wanted a larger tile (less grout to clean!) but something with a bit more character than subway tile. At first, I was unsure about going with a handmade 6 x 18 tile because each cut was slightly different, but in the end it turned out beautifully and the hand-made nature of the tile gave it a textured appearance that we absolutely love. As for the shower floors, we did a micro-mosaic which makes me happy every time I look down at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As unexpected challenges or issues arose—as they always do in remodeling—Erion handled them with a calm demeanor, thoroughly explaining my options and letting me know how they would affect factors such as time and cost. He would talk through the pros and cons of various options and together we would make a decision on how to move forward. At no point did I ever feel steamrolled, or like he was cutting corners. Erion demonstrated an exceptional dedication to quality and was just as concerned as I was that everything be done right and look good. The end result is a beautifully serene space and the sort of justification for all my time and anguish that I’d hoped for.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postscript: While writing this blog post, our apartment suffered severe water damage from a neighbor’s apartment. The silver lining in this situation is that we knew exactly who to call and who we could trust to do the work. Erion dropped everything to help us navigate this urgent situation, going above and beyond to help us triage damage and map a way forward. He has truly become our technical and professional liaison for maintaining and improving our largest investment, and the confidence I have in his practices, tastes, and commitment to quality cannot be overstated. Thank you, Sweeten, for connecting us.</span></p>
