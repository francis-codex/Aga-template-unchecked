			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering laminate wood flooring for your home? The benefits abound, from costs and style to durability</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="brown-laminate-wood-flooring" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg" alt="Brown laminate wood flooring with beige bench and side stool" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51403 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With lumber prices skyrocketing, many homeowners are rethinking their material choices for renovations. One alternative to hardwood flooring, that deserves a second look, is laminate that looks like wood. Although lumber prices are starting to drop back to normal levels, Sweeten lays out what the benefits are beyond price alone to choosing laminate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is laminate flooring?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Lamination is a process of uniting layers of material by an adhesive (or other means.) Laminate wood flooring is just that–it is three material layers pressed together, using heat, to create a strong product. The base layer of laminate flooring is wood particleboard, followed by a layer with a wood image, known as the design layer. Over top is a protective transparent wear layer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is easy to confuse laminate wood flooring with vinyl wood flooring. The main difference is their composition: laminate is 99% wood product, and vinyl wood flooring is all plastic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As with everything, there are tradeoffs when choosing one material over another. However, laminate flooring has a lot going for it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Pros:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Less expensive than hardwoods</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Durable: kid- and pet-friendly</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Comes in many styles and color options</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Is easy to install as a DIY project</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Can last from 10 to 25 years, depending on quality, care, and amount of use</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Generally eco-friendly: Made of post-consumer wood products; no need for glues or adhesives in installation; can be removed and re-used; can be recycled </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Cons:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Unlike solid hardwood flooring, laminate can’t be refinished when it begins to show signs of wear</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">It&#8217;s not 100% waterproof (not recommended for kitchens, bathrooms, or over cement slabs, as in basements)</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Difficult to repair</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring has been around for more than 40 years. Over that time, manufacturers have improved on both the product’s performance and style. Today, there seem to be endless variations of the types of laminate available. Here are some of the features to keep in mind when choosing the right kind of laminate floors for your renovation.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Style and design</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Because laminate flooring is manufactured, the sky’s the limit on styles. With advances in technology, laminate wood flooring can very closely imitate the look and feel of real hardwoods. Today’s laminate includes grooves and ridges in the texture that create a natural-looking character. Boards come in all sizes: short, long, thin, or wide-plank. Want that hand-scraped wood look? No problem. Working on a coastal look? Laminate comes in gray and white-washed stains. You can choose your look by color variation, wood species, style theme, and size.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Underlayment</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is installed as a floating floor. As a part of proper installation, a separate underlayment is required. The <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">type of underlayment</span></a> varies depending on the subfloor. However, some laminate wood flooring products come with attached underlayment. In this case, a separate underlayment is not necessary. Pay attention when you buy as to whether or not your planks already come with or without this feature.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Waterproof</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">No laminate wood flooring is truly waterproof; for that, look to vinyl wood flooring. Despite this, you will see laminate wood flooring on the market, advertised as being waterproof. This tends to mean it is “spillproof.” Read the warranty closely. In the case where water gets under the flooring, either due to standing water under an appliance or installation over a previous cement slab, the wood material can still be damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Noise resistance</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Some laminate manufacturers market features to reduce sound transmission underfoot. This can include attached backings, or the option to pair the flooring with a specific additional underlayment pad. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Use with radiant floor heating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Radiant heating is a type of in-floor heating system that goes below the floor covering. Just as some solid wood species are better than others for use with radiant heating, the same goes for laminate. There are laminate wood flooring products designed for use with radiant heating. Discuss with your contractor what humidity levels you need to maintain to avoid gapping between the boards. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Durability rating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is known for being durable. Just how durable? Check <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">its AC rating</span></a>. Short for Abrasion Criteria, the rating ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most durable. AC1 is suitable for low-traffic areas. For residential uses, AC3 or AC4 is generally advised for high-traffic rooms.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring cost vs. hardwood</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Obviously, solid hardwood flooring comes from planks milled from real trees. And that explains why, generally speaking, solid hardwood floors cost more than laminate flooring. The price is tied to factors such as weather, the rareness of wood, <span class="s8">and export costs</span>. Conversely, laminate wood flooring costs are based on its quality and style features: thickness; durability of wear layer; and presence of underlayment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While laminate overall is less expensive than hardwoods, high-end laminate wood may cost more per square foot than low-end hardwoods. When choosing your laminate flooring, think about your durability needs, in addition to the other features we covered. (And, keep in mind, there are other variables to consider overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">when choosing a flooring material!)</span></a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does hardwood flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/how-much-does-flooring-cost/"><span class="s9">Forbes</span></a>, hardwood flooring costs can average from $3–$12 a square foot. Add to that $26 (or higher) for 500 square feet of the required underlayment. Labor costs for hardwood flooring installation add an extra $3–$9 a square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The type of wood you choose affects the cost. <span class="s9">For example</span>, an exotic hardwood, like Brazilian walnut, can range from $8–$14 a square foot. A softer, more plentiful wood, such as pine, averages from $3–$6 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Adding together materials and labor averages, total hardwood flooring costs can range between $6–$21 a square foot. For perspective, costs to install real hardwood flooring in a 500-square-foot area would be between $3,000–$10,500.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does laminate flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s10">Most laminate flooring comes with an interlocking tongue-and-groove system. </span><span class="s1">Being a very DIY-friendly option, it’s helpful to focus on material costs alone. Laminate flooring can be purchased for as low as $0.59 a square foot, and can range upwards of $6 a square foot. Purchasing laminate with an attached underlayment will cost you more up-front, but will save on labor later.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s11">Breaking <span class="s12">this down further, laminate</span></span><span class="s2"> with a thin wear layer is available for as low as under $1 a square foot. Medium-quality laminate ranges from $2–$4, and high-quality sells for $3–$5+ a square foot.</span></p>
<h4>How much does it cost to install laminate wood flooring?</h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">If you’d rather have a pro install your laminate wood flooring, labor costs average between $1–$3 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Altogether with materials and labor combined, laminate floors can cost as low as $1.59 and as high as $9 a square foot. That means it would cost between $795 and $4,500 to install laminate wood flooring in a 500-square-foot area.</span></p>
<h5>Choosing laminate floors for your home</h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The advances in laminate flooring technology over the past several decades have made a once-eschewed flooring material a strong contender to hardwoods. With its lower cost, durability, eco-friendliness, and wide range of style options, more people today are happily picking laminate hardwood flooring for their homes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural, versatile, timeless&#8230;wood floors can last for decades or even generations. But if there&#8217;s damage after years of wear, or the stain just isn&#8217;t suited to your style, replacing them may be your best bet for safer and better-looking floors. Ahead, we share five reasons Sweeten homeowners decided to replace hardwood floors and revitalize their spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Improving the overall home design</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35230" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07.jpg" alt="home renovation, living room renovation, open floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With low ceilings at just a little over eight feet high, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie and Adam worked to create an illusion</a> of a taller height. A ceiling plan for each room was planned out by the couple. This included narrow interior doors, white walls, colorful art, and 7-inch wide hickory flooring throughout.</span></p>
<h3>Adding soundproofing to floors</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36986 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Murray Hill living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>When Christina decided to renovate her studio co-op in Murray Hill, the building requested that she <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install a layer of soundproofing</a>. Even if soundproofing isn’t mandated, it can add a layer of ease and “acoustic comfort” to your space. And, Christina pointed out that the installation process isn’t as bad as you might think. About replacing her floors, she said: “the entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.”</p>
<h3>Repairing subfloor water damage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35603 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg" alt="This homeowner replaced water-damage flooring for light, wooden oak floorboards" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
In Sherry&#8217;s midtown apartment, the wood floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered from water damage</a>.  A previous tenant had left the windows open for weeks when Sherry&#8217;s family rented the apartment out. When she was ready to move into the space, she changed out the damaged floorboards for sleek, new oak wide-paneled wood flooring.</p>
<h3>Replacing uneven (and noisy) hardwood floors</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38259 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792.jpg" alt="Warm red oak wooden floors replace the once uneven, creaky wood flooring in this city apartment" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />When Katie and Marcus&#8217; bought their apartment, they knew they&#8217;d have to replace the noisy and uneven wood floors. Their contractor started to rip open the floorboards, only to find there was no subfloor. He worked to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/replacing-wood-floors-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add in new subflooring and soundproofing</a> and replace the floors. They decided on a warm red oak that complements the exposed brick fireplace.</p>
<h3>Reflecting more natural light</h3>

A Manhattan couple decided <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/kips-bay-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replacing wood floors with a lighter finish</a> would give their space a brighter look. Their designer helped refresh their space by painting the walls a warmer white hue and by adding translucent drapes to let in more natural light.</p>

<h3>Remodeling for a new life chapter</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Manhattan couple bought their three-bedroom apartment in Kips Bay Towers, designed by renowned architects I.M. Pei and S.J. Kessler, more than 30 years ago, they renovated. Fast forward three decades, which included the whirlwind of raising kids, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/renovations-dream-homes-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was time for a redo</a>. What had looked good then, now looked tired and outdated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen had already been renovated a second time and the avid entertainers, who host plenty of dinner parties, made the living and dining rooms next on the renovation list. Their interior designer, <a href="https://tarabenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Benet</a>, turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found this Sweeten contractor</a> to bring the vision to life.</p>
<div></div>
<h3>Enhancing natural light in the home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen curtains were drab and did not gracefully frame the exceptional floor-to-ceiling views from the glass-front apartment complex. The cream and beige tones also did little to complement the New York City backdrop. Comfy couches and cluttered decor lacked the glamorous, crisp, and adventurous style reflecting the couple&#8217;s modern-day taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood flooring also became an issue. The original rug had been in the same spot for 30 years. The intense natural light left a darker footprint where the UV rays had not faded the varnish. The couple went with a lighter floor color to match the overall brighter look, adding a fresh touch to the whole renovation. Previously, the homeowners had used old-fashioned track lighting because the concrete ceiling couldn’t take any sunken lights. Their modern solution? Using two chandeliers to light the room. As a bonus, their unique design also made them a focal point in the living area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, open floor plan" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35659" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-10-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, table, decor" width="1000" height="1400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35658" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-10-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-10-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-10-1-600x840.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-10-1-723x1012.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-10-1-585x819.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A white-painted background became a canvas for the other elements in the room to stand out. However, the couple came to learn that white is never just white. &#8220;There was a lot of debate over the white which needed to be a little bit warmer than it was before. We ended up with a shade that has a tiny bit of orange. It has a glow to it,&#8221; Tara said. And to offset the white, a muted royal blue acts as a deep color accent and can be seen running through the custom-made rug, a throw rug, and the living room chairs. (Blue is also a contrasting color to the orange hue added to the white paint.)</p>
<h3>Picking the materials and color palette</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A secondary color palette—the metallics of brass, bronze, and gold—further balance the blue accent. This is seen in the vases on the dining room table, in the construction of the coffee table, woven into the pillows, and throughout the lamps and light fixtures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, couch, rug" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35655" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the strength of the view through the windows, Tara helped her clients achieve an uncluttered look and did not use much wall art. To inject some creativity, they picked out well-designed furniture that could almost double as art pieces. The blue chairs from designer Walter Knoll function like little works of art that you can sit in, as do the Roche Bobois sofas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, open floor plan, dining room" width="1000" height="1400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-600x840.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-723x1012.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-585x819.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen drapes were replaced with near-translucent fabric, letting in more light and giving a gossamery feel. And the view will never be obscured. The curtains are purely for appearances; they are locked into the ceiling and floor and cannot be moved, ensuring the &#8220;wow&#8221; moment when guests get a first glimpse of the cityscape. &#8220;They literally never want to close the windows,&#8221; Tara said.</p>
<h3>The key to remodeling success? Team communication.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Tara, their Sweeten contractor was a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great communicator and in constant communication</a> with her and the clients. He was even willing to meet with the client on weekends to keep the project on schedule. With a touch up for the millwork, a fresh coat of paint, and refinishing the floor varnish, it’s a reminder that less often equals more when luxe furniture and lighting make up a dream space.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-49070 size-full" title="beveled subway tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg" alt="bathroom with black subway tile in the shower" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3>Floor tile from modern country and classic to monochrome</h3>
<p class="p1">While it’s most important for bathroom floor tile to be functional, finding the right design style is what gives the room its personality. Fortunately, the cost of bathroom tile presents a wide spectrum of shapes, colors, and finishes. From the penny round to cement tile, increase or lower the design volume to match your vision.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are some top looks from our Sweeten bathroom renovations—along with pricing info—to guide your search. The price points below fit a wide range of budgets—from $2 per square foot for a classic ceramic and $18+ for a more handmade look to $30+ for a marble mosaic.</p>

<h3>Herringbone tile</h3>
<div></div>
<p>(<em>1st photo</em>) Kyli and Luke&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black herringbone tile</a>; (<em>2nd photo</em>) Karun&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/concrete-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industrial bathroom</a>; (<em>3rd photo</em>) Greenwich Village <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loft bath</a></p>
<p class="p1">The herringbone floor tile pattern can easily be the featured focal point in the bathroom. Choose a neutral and the design still delivers dimension and texture. Or opt for a bolder hue for more impact. In a variety of sizes and colors, the tile is popular in marble, porcelain, and ceramic between $4.25–$50 per square foot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Kyli and Luke renovated their bathroom in their 1920s house and used materials that would last. They designed the room to be stark and graphic. Black porcelain tile with black grout produced the artisanal effect they wanted. Sweeten homeowner Karun brought a modern industrial look to his bathroom. A marble herringbone floor tile softens the edgy raw feel overall. In a Greenwhich Village loft, marble is a main feature in the kitchen. The homeowner followed suit with marble in the bathroom with a larger-format herringbone.</p>

<p class="p1">Cement tile, or encaustic, is durable and its texture has more grip underfoot. Therefore, it is a safe and good-looking choice for the bathroom. Made from natural materials, cement tiles are also porous so they need to be sealed properly. Sweeten homeowners Mitzi and Jenifer installed the same federal blue floor tile in their master and guest bathrooms: one in a stacked bond pattern and the other in a herringbone.</p>
<p class="p1">Plenty of linear shapes coordinate nicely in artist Katy Garry’s master bath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Her Sweeten renovation mixed glossy subway tile with graphic cement floor tile in primarily black neutrals. These tiles can cost between $10–$18 per square foot for an 8” x 8” tile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Ceramic tile</h3>

<p><span class="s1"></span>Ceramic tile is a versatile choice if you’re looking for solids, patterns, or the look of natural materials like marble or slate. Its water-resistant qualities make it function well in the bathroom. <span class="s1"></span>Brooke and Sam fashioned a perfectly balanced style in their powder room. Wood-looking ceramic tile was the right neutral to complement a black-and-white floral wallpaper in a large-scale pattern.</p>
<p class="p1">Initially, Nicole thought she wanted an all-white bathroom for her basement. She decided, however, to let this room give the bottom floor the personality it was missing. Thanks to her Sweeten contractor, she had guidance with material selections. So, Nicole settled on a 16” x 16” patterned gray ceramic floor tile. Depending on shape and color, <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>expect to spend between $3.50–$40 per square foot.</p>

<h3>Hexagon tile</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Tara and Brian&#8217;s bath, dark hexagon tile paired with light grout grounds the design and gives it a modern vibe.</p>
<p><span class="s1"></span>A Sweeten homeowner in Prospect Heights chose classic white on white for her bathroom renovation. Except for a few modern black finishes, her marble hex floor tile has the graphic pattern of a honeycomb. Expect prices to be between $5–$45+ per square foot. <span class="s1"></span>Marble and ceramic start at around $15 per square foot, and porcelain at $10.</p>
<h3>Penny tile</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="cost of bathroom tile with gradient blue and white penny tile" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56694" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29227 " title="mosaic penny tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom tile costs" width="769" height="1151" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />
(<em>Top photo</em>) Katy&#8217;s blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny bath tile</a>; (<em>b</em><em>ottom photo</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/penny-tile-beige-bath-blue-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Michael’s shower</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Penny tile is a classic option that gives off major vintage vibes. The goldfish artwork, created by artist and Sweeten homeowner Katy Garry, inspired the dappling of gradient white and blue penny tile. It covers her bathroom from floor to ceiling invoking the sense of being in the water. In Brooklyn, Rachel and Michael’s shower renovation transformed it into a waterfall mosaic. Penny tile is a type of inexpensive floor tile, costing as little as $5 per square foot for white porcelain. The price increases to $18 or more for colorful mosaics.</p>
<h3>Basketweave</h3>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Basketweave is truly old-school, but it’s been making a steady comeback. For example, in Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s master bathroom, it feels surprisingly modern as part of the minimalist design. In Tara and Mike’s bath, the tile lends itself to a more traditional look without making the space feel dated. Porcelain, a material used in inexpensive bathroom tile, can cost around $8 per square foot; high-quality marble begins around $30 per square foot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Our favorite projects across five neighborhoods</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a population almost as large as Brooklyn, and the biggest footprint of the five boroughs, Queens has a lot to offer. Besides its growing, international food scene, a mix of established neighborhoods and amenity-laden condos, and an influx of tech startups, there&#8217;s the proximity to Manhattan, the U.S. Open tennis tournament, and Citi Field (go Mets!). <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, provides a peek into renovations across the borough, all the way from Long Island City to Ridgewood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28204 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When their tiny, 700-square-foot Manhattan apartment began to feel cramped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah and Craig</a> packed their bags and moved to Long Island City. They found a 1,160-square-foot one bedroom that felt enormous in comparison to their previous digs. At first, the spacious upgrade was more than enough. Four years later, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-to-bottom renovation</a> allowed the couple to transform their home into the stylish and eclectic space that they’d always wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27104 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The very tight kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/">Lisa and Chris’s</a> Kew Gardens co-op made cooking in the space awkward. If you opened the refrigerator door, you’d end up trapping yourself in the kitchen! Converting the wall into a peninsula widened the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a> and increased dining and prep space. With the addition of new cabinets and appliances, the kitchen refresh was just what they needed to enjoy their home again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25185 mb-0 size-chrono" title="apartment flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Housed in the former building of the <em>Ridgewood Times</em> newspaper, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael and Chenta’s</a> loft had deep roots in Queens. A condo conversion in the early aughts—white walls and wood floors—stripped the space of its original, industrial charm. Looking to restore some of that raw quality, the couple ripped up the tired wood floors and exposed the original concrete underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24325 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A long search for a larger space led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan and Cecilia</a> to a mid-century apartment in Elmhurst. With a 25-minute commute to midtown, the location was perfect for them. The 1,300-square-foot, 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op was a true fixer-upper. The couple made changes to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor plan</a> and updated fixtures and finishes in the kitchen, bathrooms, and living areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27494 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> loved their neighborhood of Astoria but needed more space. What the next apartment lacked in style and function it made up for in square footage. They focused their renovation on the kitchen and bathroom—the two spaces that would benefit the most from an upgrade. Custom cabinets, new appliances, and gold pendant lights took the kitchen from drab to fab. In the bathroom, the couple drew design inspiration from their favorite New York City restaurants, installing new fixtures and a fun, pineapple print wallpaper.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20504 size-chrono" title="hardwood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="sweeten_rima_hardwood_flooring-10" width="723" height="482" /></a>(Above) Rima installed mid-sized <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plank engineered wood</a> with a matte finish throughout her home.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Of all the surface options available for the home, hardwood flooring remains the one with the most cachet and value. After all, it&#8217;s warm in appearance, easy underfoot (especially compared to tile or stone), versatile in application thanks to the range of wood species and finishes available, and innately luxurious. From solid to engineered to salvaged, you’re likely to find an option that suits your home’s style as well as your lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Wood flooring prices can vary greatly, depending on where the flooring was manufactured, how it was made, how it was finished, and who’s installing it. Base your decision on where the floor will go, and what type of activity those rooms will see. Flooring is an investment—of resources and the time it takes to install it. Make the right choice, and you will enjoy your wood floor for probably as long as you want it.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider your lifestyle</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, examine what the room or room(s) will be used for, how much traffic they will experience, and what kind. Wood can be enjoyed throughout most homes, with a few precautions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Will there be pets scratching it with their nails? </span><span class="s1">High heels from frequent entertaining? </span><span class="s1">Toys from energetic little ones?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do you expect grit consistently tracked from the front door or backyard? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the room get loads of sunlight that could fade the surface in some areas? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Is there the possibility of accidental yet prolonged exposure to water, next to a dishwasher or by a bathtub, which could cause the floor to swell? </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Today’s hardwood flooring often features highly durable polyurethane coatings that are formulated to stand up to light or average wear, but you will need to commit yourself to a regular maintenance routine in order to keep the surface beautiful. And engineered versions, with a wood veneer backed by a composite that helps assure its stability (while slightly lowering the cost compared to its solid wood cousin), can sometimes go in environments that experience some moisture, like a basement or a bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27034 size-chrono" title="engineered wood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Throughout Tom and Alex&#8217;s apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered wood</a> replaced old parquet floors.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Customize the look</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Each species of wood has its own color and grain, and the choice is yours. Appearance has expanded beyond classic wood species and stains to include colored washes and dramatic textures added during manufacturing, from classic satin to wire-brushed to scraped. These distressed effects also serve to hide some wear over time as well as enhance character. Dimensions vary, too, from traditional narrow strips to wide planks that lend a rustic mood and also means fewer seams into the overall floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The hardness of the wood should be taken into account, too. If your floor will see a lot of action, you want one of the harder species, like oak, maple, or hickory. The ranking system for hardness among different species, called the Janka hardness test, measures how a wood stands up to dents and wear. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Finishes affect the overall style, with a range of high, medium, or low gloss available from most manufacturers, depending on whether you want a highly polished or a more satiny effect. The finish, applied in anywhere from three to seven coats, should include aluminum oxide to make it resistant to the abrasions of daily foot traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Click-lock versus tongue-and-groove</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Edge treatments vary widely to give you plenty of options to achieve the look you want, from square to beveled to scraped to pillowed. Wood floors connect one edge to another by means of two methods: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like the term implies, click-lock boards click into place to provide an almost seamless appearance, except for the grain of the wood. Found in engineered wood flooring, these require no adhesive and so the installation tends to go faster.</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The tongue-and-groove method fits together using a thin piece on one long side that fits into the grooved indenture on the adjoining board’s side. Planks are further secured when nailed, glued, or laid in a floating installation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28816" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />(Above) Dark walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in Jonathan and Cecilia&#8217;s home adds richness and a sense of depth to their space.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Get real with solid hardwood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solid hardwood</a> comes either factory-finished or can be finished on site. Factory-finished flooring arrives needing only to be installed, making it clean and quick to lay down. This method eliminates or reduces the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The curing that site-finished wood requires (which can take up to two months as the wood adjusts to your home’s climate)</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Dust from sanding</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chemical fumes from the finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time from start of installation to complete drying of finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time to final use of room</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The finish is also cured under UV lights at the factory, a process that can’t happen on site, so the factory-finish is likely tougher than the one applied on site. This floor should also include a warranty from the manufacturer instead of the installer. The main benefit of having a site-finished floor is if you desire total control over the final look. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Factory-finished floors typically arrive already topped with several layers of a water- or oil-based polyurethane coating that incorporates aluminum oxide to protect the wood from scratches and fading due to sunlight. A clear top coat provides the glossy or satin appearance. This floor can be refinished several times until the multilayer coating is completely removed, which then means reapplying the finish or, in extreme situations, replacing the plank. If your floor is finished on site, discuss with the installer what type of finish he recommends, and if it includes aluminum oxide.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Caution: Solid wood is a natural material, making it vulnerable to swings in temperature and humidity. Because it will expand and contract, it must be fastened to a subfloor but not concrete, so it can’t go below-grade or in damp areas like a basement or a bath that gets lots of steam.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono" title="engineered wood floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineered wood</a> finished with a natural veneer pairs well with exposed brick in Miguel&#8217;s bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Fool the eye with engineered wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If it looks like it’s real wood, that’s because it is—a veneer of real wood atop a structural base, typically plywood. The base gives it added stability so it can go in a bath or a basement, as well as over radiant heating elements. It requires fewer trees than solid hardwood, but the base includes glues that bind the plywood and the veneer. This option is easy to install as a floating floor or it can be secured with staples or glue. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Expect to find all the classic species of woods and stains in this engineered wood category, as well as some fun fashion colors like a gray wash. You’ll discover a range of quality, too, so when shopping, investigate the thickness of the veneer, the number of protective coatings, and the number of ply in the base, which can range from three to seven and up. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Refinishing engineered wood is far more limited than solid wood—as little as once, depending on the thickness of the veneer. Buy an extra box in the event you need to replace a plank, so you don’t have to worry about matching. Ask about warranties for both the finish and veneer delamination.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Go authentic with reclaimed wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the most environmentally-friendly choice, reclaimed wood that is salvaged from old buildings requires no cutting of trees. Its unique appeal comes from its original sourcing, which may be domestic woods that are now rare or unavailable for residential use. Like a vintage wine, reclaimed wood also shows a character that can’t be reproduced today, even from advanced manufacturing techniques. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This wood is typically sourced from old factories, deconstructed homes, old decking or piers, but it still has to be treated to go into its new home. It may be warped or cracked in areas, and so require some milling before it’s ready for installation. Make sure the wood is kiln-dried after milling, as this will aid its stability and also eliminate the possibility of critters, such as termites. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This category can be found from a few national dealers, like Mountain Lumber, or locally by doing a search online, but if you shop from an independent dealer, make sure he or she guarantees the product.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider maintenance and repair </b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest enemy of your wood floor is nearly invisible grit tracked in on shoes. Place area rugs or mats at entry points to catch dirt. Try to sweep or vacuum daily, clean monthly with a wood floor cleaner recommended by the manufacturer, so you can enjoy your floor for a lifetime.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Light or dark, wide-plank flooring is a smart investment that provides lasting style</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like a pair of jeans, wide-plank flooring is a classic design that comes in a variety of materials and finishes and can adapt to any <span style="color: #000000;">decor</span>. It works in every room of your home as a dependable canvas for the rest of your design choices and furnishings. This width comes in engineered and hardwood styles, both of which are high-quality and long-lasting. If you’re thinking about a cost-effective option, engineered is the way to go. However, if you really want <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a>, go for it! Don’t be discouraged by daily wear and tear. Like those jeans we talked about earlier, hardwood only gets better with age. Below, five Sweeten homeowners use wide-plank flooring to complete the look of their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25922 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13-723x1095.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1095" /></a>A hallway in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill home</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill couple replaced orange-hued parquet with matte wide-plank flooring to set the tone of their home, outfitting their main hallway, kitchen, and combined dining and living spaces with it. They chose a high-grade engineered wood in a pale shade that counterbalances the white walls.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25923 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-723x469.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="469" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-austins-williamsburg-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin’s bedroom</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin’s pale shade of matte flooring looks familiar, but unlike the Clinton Hill couple, his bedroom floor is made of hardwood. The feeling is fresh and simple and contributes to his home’s sense of serenity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25924 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Ron’s apartment, dark, wide-plank <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>, fully waterproofed, adds richness to an all-white kitchen. The engineered wood planks continue throughout the living and dining spaces, providing a touch of drama within the home’s otherwise neutral palette of sand and beige tones<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25925 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/claudia-and-alejandros-boerum-hill-condo-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claudia and Alejandro’s nursery</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia tore out the old, yellow tinted floors and installed a light oak floor in every room of her home, including the nursery. Paired with lightly colored walls, the look is soft and dreamy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25926 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14-723x468.jpg" alt="wide-plank flooring" width="723" height="468" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario and Joe’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another take on oak: Mario and Joe chose matte wide-plank flooring to modernize the appearance of their apartment. In the kitchen, layered rugs add color and texture.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>Here’s how to keep key materials—from countertops to appliances—performing at tip top</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">home renovation</a> draws to a close, you may experience feelings of relief and joy at the transformation from the old to the new. Decisions on materials turned out to be good choices, and daily life is now blending and flowing around your new space. Aftercare may be the last thing on your mind, or you may find yourself wondering: &#8220;How do I keep my newly renovated space looking great for years to come?&#8221;. Here are five ways to care for your new home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Range with white tile backsplash and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Consult manufacturers’ manuals for appliance care</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An obvious first renovation aftercare step that many homeowners skip. Most appliance manufacturers have a place on their webpage dedicated to manuals or product service and support. A model number will lead you to literature on cleaning and maintenance. Often, a simple Google search is enough. For example, a stainless wine refrigerator requires little attention except for periodically washing off fingerprints. This can be done with water and mild dish soap, then polished with a microfiber cloth dipped in mineral, cooking or olive oil. Note: Clean and polish with the grain. Look closely! Steel has grain just like wood. Here are extra tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://amzn.to/44JR5ag">Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes or Liquid Spray</a> work great</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Register major appliances with the manufacturer through their website.</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you know the model numbers for future reference &#8212; often they are on the back of the machine so take a picture or write it down for future reference.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak with your contractor about how to maintain your equipment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Safeguard your kitchen countertops</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You probably reviewed pros and cons of different materials before you made your final decision of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/">kitchen countertops</a>. Ready to start cooking? Here’s a refresh!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><strong>Quartz countertops</strong>, such as <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caesarstone</a>, are durable, non-porous and do not need to be annually resealed, but acidic foods or juices can erode the acrylic. This material is also more likely to be damaged by excessive heat than granite, crushed glass or concrete. Treat yourself to trivets.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Porous natural stones</strong>, such as granite and marble, may need to be resealed periodically and are susceptible to stains from oils and acids. Don’t let spilled liquids sit on your stone countertops. Spill? Swipe! Accidents happen &#8212; <a href="https://amzn.to/44LtExe">this etch remover</a> can be a lifesaver</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate or solid-surfacing countertops</strong>, in this case, renovation aftercare means cutting boards are mandatory because both of these materials are easily scratched.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp" alt="Shower with green and white patterned tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57255" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Tend to your tiles</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/">Bathroom tiles</a> get hazy with soapy residue, while kitchen backsplashes get splattered with oil, and floor tiles experience both! Regular cleaning will prevent the need to muscle through buildup, so break out a mild all-purpose cleaner and some basic cleaning equipment.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">For kitchen backsplash tiles, mix dish liquid with water and rub away the oily residue with a sponge or gentle cloth. White vinegar mixed with warm water is another option. A mild all-purpose cleaner will clean up bath tiles nicely. Mix the solution with water and wipe with a rag, a soft brush or sponge.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweep or vacuum floor tiles of any debris and grit on a regular basis to avoid dulling or scratching the surface. After clearing away large particles, use a mop and bucket with mild soap or detergent and warm water. If you wind up with a hazy film, consider switching up your mop material (sponge to chamois, for example) and/or wipe away the film with a fresh cloth and an all-purpose cleaner.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Seal your grout! Where there is tile, there is grout. <a href="https://amzn.to/3EusDPF">Use a sealant like this one</a>. For renovation aftercare for your grout, use gentle brushes to scrub it clean. And if your regular tile cleaning routine is not doing the trick on your grout, try a paste of baking soda and water, a mild bleach solution or store-bought grout cleaner. Remember to reseal grout periodically.</li>

<h3><strong>4. Work with your wood</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Refinished or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand new hardwoods</a> can be beautiful foundations for your home. If you are the type of family that takes off your shoes before entering the home, you are off to a great start! Even if not, caring for your floors can be easy with a few simple guidelines.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Begin your flooring renovation aftercare by placing indoor and outdoor welcome mats. Mats placed before and after the threshold of your door are an important first step in maintaining scratch- and stain-free floors even in the winter.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Area rugs cut down on regular wear and tear on the floors in the areas where they are positioned.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Little felt stickers (<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z7SqXp">like these</a>) do a good job protecting your floors from furniture-driven scratches.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few rules of thumb when cleaning your floors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sweep or vacuum debris on a regular basis</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mop with water and a gentle soap and never leave water or other liquids sitting on your hardwoods. Water can eventually penetrate the finish and leave stains in the wood. If you are not sure what cleaner to use on your floors, manufacturers of wood sealants often offer hardwood floor cleaners, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3RcK4vs">Minwax® Hardwood Floor Cleaner</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Laura-pantry-09-scaled.gif" alt="Moving image off renovator in custom cabinets" width="1706" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57343" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Care for your cabinets</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although you likely will not be cleaning your kitchen or bathroom cabinets as often as higher-traffic surfaces (such as shower tiles and cooking countertops), don’t forget about them!  </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Knobs and pulls can harbor germs and cabinet doors can become grimy over time from moisture and oils in the air. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly to hardwood floors, wooden cabinets don’t do well with water or other liquids resting on their surface.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you clean your cabinets with soapy water, white vinegar water or mild all-purpose cleaner, remember these vital last steps: wipe away cleaner residue with a wet cloth and dry your cabinets with a towel.</span></p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia. Similar programs exist in many other cities such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/community-development/housing-assistance/residential-property-tax-abatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>
<table style="height: 349px;" width="797">

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;<br />
Your choice in tile can influence the entire space it occupies. Here is how <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur and Kate</a> used stacked patterns in minimalist fashion, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly</a> went bold with cement tile on the floor but subtly glamorous on the wall. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet’s</a> geometric backsplash become the kitchen’s centerpiece, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s</a> subtle 3D tile struck a perfect balance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Good news: You can have pretty much whatever you want, as long as you follow a few guidelines</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22170 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Maple engineered wood flooring in IKEA kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label">Engineered wood flooring in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rima&#8217;s</a> kitchen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The decisions to be made when designing a kitchen can be daunting—the sheer number alone, let alone the anxiety. Will this material work in the cook space? Will it hold up? Will I still like it in five years? Factor in a growing family and those worries begin to multiply: What if the kids drop their juice boxes; will it stain? What if my child falls&#8230;will he hurt himself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides looks and function, you need to consider what type of traffic the flooring will experience. Is it off the garage or a deck, where dirt can be tracked in? Do you also have pets that can scratch with claws or bring water and dirt from outside? Is your child in a high chair that gets dragged around frequently in one area, or has he graduated to his own mini vehicle during playtime, adding to the wear and tear? Health is a factor, too, of course, and any flooring that is manufactured and/or has a finish should be able to provide a rating for its various contents and performance, including VOC emission and slippage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take all of these factors into account as you consider the following materials underfoot. The good news: You can install just about whatever you want, and, with a few precautions, continue to enjoy it as your family grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hardwood</strong><br />
Sought out for its natural elegance, wood also delivers a lot: It offers a slight pliancy underfoot so items you drop are less likely to break than on a harder surface such as tile. The two basic wood options:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solid wood</strong></span><br />
If you love solid wood, opt for prefinished floors (aka, “factory finished”) that come from the factory with a hard-wearing top coat of aluminum oxide urethane that offers protection from scratches while minimizing upkeep, like waxing; daily sweeping should do it. Ask your dealer about the warranty, which should be provided by the manufacturer and not the installer, so you have greater recourse if the floor needs a major or immediate repair. This type of floor also can be refinished, as long as the dings are not too deep. If your preference is for hardwood but you worry about those dings, take a look at “distressed” styles that can disguise any new dents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: This type of floor will fade with regular exposure to sunlight, so don’t put it by a window that ushers in strong daily outdoor sun. You also need to think about exposure to moisture—say, a leak at the dishwasher or fridge, or water constantly splashed by the sink. And if your toddler drops food by the high chair, you will want to take a precaution and put a mat underneath, to prevent spotting or stains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engineered wood</strong></span><br />
The other option in this category is engineered wood flooring, which is made of a thin veneer of real wood attached to structural plywood. It should cost a little less than solid wood, but depending on the thickness of the veneer, you may not be able to refinish it, making it not such a thrifty choice after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Formaldehyde, used as an adhesive, can be found in some engineered wood floors, including bamboo (see below), but at the present time this chemical is not strictly regulated, so you need to inquire with the salesperson or manufacturer with regard to any floor made with pressed wood or medium density fiberboard (MDF).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bamboo</strong><br />
Although actually a grass, bamboo is sold with hardwoods for many of the same reasons—looks natural and warm, endures light to medium wear, is easy underfoot. Most bamboo flooring is made of a bamboo veneer attached to a backing such as plywood or MDF. But you need to be mindful of quality. Bamboo gets treated with many chemicals to turn it into a material suitable for flooring so off-gassing can be a factor. Also, this relative newcomer to flooring has many manufacturing sources and quality control is not yet highly regulated. Investigate thoroughly, as with any product you bring into your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate</strong><br />
This type of flooring is similar to laminate countertops, in that it is composed of dense fiberboard topped with a photographic image of a real wood (or other material) that is then topped with a clear protective layer. With the development of HD printing, laminate offers a lot of different wood looks, and you can mix several styles (e.g., a pale oak with a colored border) to achieve some fun effects. It tends to resist light scratching and fading from sunlight. And that hollow sound that turned off many homeowners once upon a time has been eliminated by many manufacturers that incorporate underneath a sound-muffling material like cork. Laminate is installed as a “floating floor,” which means there’s no glue or nails. Boards connect by means of an interlocking tongue and groove design. Since there’s no need to connect the boards to a subfloor, they can be installed over any uneven surface as long as it’s sealed and remains dry. This makes laminate a good solution till little ones are more grown up if you want to replace it eventually with tile or real wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Laminate wears well but like wood, it won’t withstand prolonged exposure to water, and it’s slippery when wet. Also, it can’t be refinished; if there’s damage, you’ll have to replace the entire board so order extra to have an exact match if needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resilient</strong><br />
Mostly vinyl falls into this category, but there’s also linoleum. As the term “resilient” indicates, this flooring is easy on humans, when little ones fall or adults stand for long periods when prepping a meal, and if you drop a dish, it’s less likely to break on this surface than on tile or even wood. It also handles a lot of wear or sunlight and resists stains from food and drink spills as well as crayons and magic markers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vinyl</strong></span><br />
Recent advances in manufacturing have improved performance since the days when vinyl was for your grandmother’s laundry room. You can now find vinyl that infuses the surface with cultured diamond particles for increased protection against dents, scratches, scuffs, and stains. HD printing advancements allow you to choose a vinyl that really looks like wood or tile. Peer closely, though, and you’ll know it’s vinyl, but the faux effects can be part of its fashion-forward appeal. Vinyl remains probably your thriftiest choice, depending on the pattern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Linoleum</strong></span><br />
Linoleum is sought for its range of saturated colors or marbled effects, resiliency, slip resistance and everyday wear. It comes in sheets, for an almost seamless appearance, as well as tiles if you want a classic checkerboard or just like that look. Made of linseed oil and other naturally sourced materials, linoleum is marketed as a “green” flooring choice, but in fact, it requires chemicals, too, to arrive at the finished product, so ask the salesperson about off-gassing and VOC ratings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Both wear well but can’t be refinished. Buy extra in case of repairs so you can match the area you need to patch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tile</strong><br />
While tile comes in both ceramic and porcelain, the latter is the harder of the two and thus more appropriate for most floors that see a lot of foot traffic. Completely resistant to fading, scratches, and moisture, tile is good for a busy household. And since it’s sealed with a fired-on glaze, it’s good if allergies are an issue, but you will want to take some precautions with youngsters in the house. Until children are old enough where toddling and falling is not an issue, use a rug in areas where little ones congregate. An expansive indoor/outdoor area rug that can be taken outside and hosed off will help protect little ones while adding a splash of colorful style. Many tiles are slip resistant since they are used in commercial areas, so ask the salesperson about this rating, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Dishware will break on this super-hard surface, and tile can crack if not installed by a pro on a perfectly smooth surface. A rug that protects little ones may have to be cleaned regularly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each week, we aim to translate insight from Sweeten experts into information you can use to make better decisions about improving your home. This week and next, let&#8217;s take on flooring. I might be biased, because new floors were the very first step I took in renovating my tiny East Village apartment, but I cannot possibly think of a better way to get a bigger bang for your buck. If you are looking to transform the way your home feels, you can do it with new floors in less than a week&#8217;s time. For proof of its impact, scroll through these flooring selections some of our favorite homeowners have made in the last year. <em><strong>Next week, check back for the full low-down on the process and cost of re-doing your floors.</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Williamsburg, <a href="https://sweeten.com/2013/10/31/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot renovated</a> with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the first floor of their townhouse. The natural knots and irregularities serve as a counterpoint to the clean cabinet lines and modern lighting fixtures. I&#8217;m always amazed at how<span id="more-11520"></span> simple white walls set against warm wood tones makes a space feel clean, bright, and relaxed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela replaced their Clinton Hill parquet with white oak, left unstained. The simple color and texture of the new floors is such a smart complement to the custom walnut millwork, saturated green accents, and mid-century modern decor that makes this home so unique.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, a homeowner combining three apartments unified the space with a custom engineered white oak floor from Master Floor, an Italian company. The planks are pre-finished with a matte effect, which keeps your eye focused on these incredible views and amplifies natural light throughout the apartment without adding any glare.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen of their Brooklyn row house, Allison and Jovito chose a porcelain tile, finished to look like wood. For extra visual impact, they laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. Porcelain was an especially smart choice for these cat owners: tile is more durable than softer wood materials and is easy to keep clean in a high-traffic area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Chelsea, this homeowner, an architect and designer, kept the wood floors that were original to the iconic London Terrace building but transformed them with a matte black finish. The decor choices throughout this apartment are so glamorous &#8211; this dark matte finish helps diversify the feel and gives a little bit of grit and texture to the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Their dream space comes to life with herringbone tile, gray kitchen cabinets, and a clawfoot tub</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Editor&#8217;s Note: This post, originally published May 2014, is one of our favorites for still having a classic and modern look years later. Allison and Jovito purchased their first home together—a single-family brick row house, c. 1910, in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn. Though they knew the place needed some serious renovations, Allison, a content manager, and Jovito, an electronic prepress director, both in textbook publishing, promptly packed up and, along with their adorable cat, Momo, moved in and geared up for some major home improvements. Allison shares their renovation story and walks us through the stylish choices she and Jovito made in the process of creating their new home.</i><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24064 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-723x493.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="493" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-723x493.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-300x205.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Guest post by Allison in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten months of intense searching, eight lost bids and a couple hundred viewed properties later, Jovito and I finally found an adorable 1910 brick row house in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn to call our own. We loved the bones and original details of the house, but the over 100-year-old home was also in need of some serious updating. Knowing that we’d have some large-scale renovations ahead of us, we went into the purchase two parts excited and one part slightly terrified.  There was a long list of items on our “fix” list when we moved in, but we also had a limited budget. So our energy and efforts were focused on tackling the kitchen and upstairs bathroom renovation first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having never renovated a property before, we didn’t know where to start. How would we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a reputable contractor</a> that would understand our vision, work within our budget, and do a stellar job? Perusing Apartment Therapy on a day when I was feeling somewhat overwhelmed by all our options, I read about Sweeten and decided to post <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our project</a> to the site. We really liked the idea that they would act as matchmakers and pair us with contractors based on our project’s scope of work and budget. Knowing that they had pre-screened their network of contractors also made choosing feel a lot less scary.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After meeting with two contractor matches from Sweeten, and two contractors that were friend referrals, we decided to award our renovation job to Sweeten. We appreciated his pragmatism, patience in answering our many questions, and his thoroughness during the onsite visit. We also appreciated that he seemed completely un-phased by the scary (to us), timeworn, “before” conditions of the kitchen and bathroom. He’d seen and worked on old houses like this many times, so that also helped us feel like we were in good hands. His familiarity with constructing IKEA kitchens and reasonable estimate sealed the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started our renovation of the kitchen and bathroom in mid-November. Living in the house during construction wasn’t fun, but our contractor and his team were careful to keep the work area as clean and contained as possible. On the plus side, it was exciting for us to see the team’s daily progress and some of the relics they unearthed during demolition. (Like pieces of newspaper from 1943 mentioning President Roosevelt stuck inside the bathroom walls!) The team spent a lot of time and effort making sure the new walls and floors were level, plumb, and true, which was no small feat in an old house where nothing is straight!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen needed a gut renovation. The walls were covered with dark wood paneling and cabinets, there was a dropped ceiling with fluorescent lighting, cracked floor tile and beat up Formica countertops and backsplash. The existing soffit ran in front of the kitchen window, cutting a good eight inches off the top, and a lot of daylight along with it. It was a less-than-optimal layout and had definitely seen better days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of our limited <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>, we decided to go with IKEA kitchen cabinetry and Caesarstone quartz countertops, both of which we purchased during one of IKEA’s kitchen sales. Not wanting the new kitchen to clash with the age of the house but also wanting it to feel current and new, we went with a more traditional cabinet door style in a medium gray color. To keep the space open and airy feeling, we decided to forego wall cabinets. We made sure we had plenty of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet storage</a> to hold all our pots and pans. Because we removed the dropped ceiling, we gained back some ceiling height, so we stacked glass-front cabinets to the ceiling and created a hutch to display our collection of vintage glassware and serveware. We chose durable white quartz countertops to keep the room bright and to add contrast to the gray cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24048 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-723x525.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="525" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24049 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re tough on our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>, so we chose extra durable wood-look porcelain tile that we found online at a closeout price. Our contractor laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. We really love the way it turned out! For the backsplash tile, we went with a large format porcelain tile with a raised geometric pattern and tiled all the way up the wall for visual impact. (It’s also incredibly <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy to clean</a>!) The wall tile is from Mondial in Bensonhurst.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We both love to cook so it was important for us to have a range that could accommodate many pots and pans and put out some serious BTUs. We were incredibly lucky to find our range second-hand in excellent condition at a local salvage shop. The exhaust hood was found in the clearance section of Home Depot and our brand new dishwasher came from the As-Is section of IKEA. Our counter-depth fridge was on sale at the local P.C. Richard &amp; Son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24051 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our ceiling light fixtures are porcelain lamp holders made by Leviton running about $2/piece online. The pendant over the sink is from Restoration Hardware and is based off an Italian factory light from the 1950s. We like that the lights can extend out about four feet on each side, giving us the option of creating more overhead <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> for prep if we need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to go with brass cabinet pulls, knobs, and faucet to warm up all the cool gray and stainless steel. It took a lot of searching to find a brushed brass faucet, but we finally found one through Newport Brass. The solid brass pulls and knobs are made by Laurey and were also found online.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our bathroom was very…blue. Blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. It had last been majorly renovated in the 50s and everything was really showing its age. The floor of the bathroom was about a 4” step up from the hallway—the ghosts of past flooring renovations buried beneath. To top it all off, the bathroom space itself was tiny—about 36 square feet. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> wouldn’t allow us to enlarge the space or reroute plumbing, so our goal was to increase the feeling of space while making it as pretty and useable as possible. Style-wise, we wanted the bathroom to look like it could have been original to the house so we were careful to choose pieces that had an old-fashioned feel to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maximize space, we swapped the existing door for a pocket door and chose a dual-flush toilet with a narrow tank and small footprint. A console sink and clawfoot tub kept things airy and off the floor. Finding reasonably-priced marble floor and subway wall tile at Lowe&#8217;s kept us on budget, as well as sourcing salvage and secondhand materials which helped to cut costs. Finally, we added an exhaust fan/light combo to help cut humidity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24056 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24057 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite holidays, lots of snow days and a few surprises along the way, the renovation process was mostly stress-free. Our contractor did a good job keeping us informed throughout construction, and he always made himself available to answer questions. And because we lived in our house during construction, we were also able to address and correct any miscommunications right away, which helped the project run more smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re thankful to the Sweeten team for pairing us up with the contractor and his team for an excellent first renovation experience! I&#8217;ve already recommended Sweeten to several friends! Sweeten&#8217;s matching service removes a lot of the scariness and uncertainty associated with finding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified contractor</a>. And when we’re finally ready to begin the next project, you can be sure we’ll be contacting them for another great match!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Many thanks to Allison, Jovito &amp; Momo for sharing your beautiful home!</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This is certainly one of those renovations that I have been anticipating with bated breath. Partly because the amazing homeowners, Kyle, an IT professional at a law firm, and Angela, a freelance illustrator, have the style and the je ne sais quoi to totally charm; but also, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I love projects like this one</a>, where the homeowners have lived in the space, dreamed about what it will be one day, and saved up for years towards the goal of making that dream home their real home. It gives all of us who may still be far from that goal, a sense of possibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-apartment-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10714 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="515" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We&#8217;d been living here for eleven years and things were starting to get a bit shabby. When we moved in, the apartment had been freshly renovated with all the cheapest materials available at Home Depot, which was fine back then, but we really wanted to make it &#8216;ours.&#8217; We saved up for renovations all the while and put a lot of thought into what we wanted to do.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"> &#8211;Angela, homeowner</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the time had arrived early this year, Kyle and Angela (and their &#8220;mean, little chihuahua&#8221;) posted to Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get started on renovating</a> their 900 sq/ft, 2 bedroom Clinton Hill co-op apartment. The road to selecting &#8216;the perfect contractor&#8217; was made a whole lot sweeter by our three suggestions; according to Angela, “we feel confident that any of the contractors Sweeten selected for us would have done a great job, but we&#8217;re really happy that we chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>.&#8221; Kris and his team were able to take the homeowners&#8217; dreams of extra counter space for baking and a place that showed off their personal mid-century style, and turn them into a reality, on-time and within-budget!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10717 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kris&#8217; team worked closely with Kyle and Angela to meet their main objectives for the project: to create a modern, open apartment AND stay on budget. First order of business was making the &#8216;big moves,&#8217; which meant tearing down the non-structural interior walls and tearing up the outdated and damaged parquet flooring. With just these changes, the homeowners could already begin to anticipate their moment of, “I can hardly believe it&#8217;s the same place we&#8217;ve lived for the past decade!”<span id="more-10713"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10718 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10719 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/06_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/06_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/06_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10720 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What I love about Kris and his team is that, not only are they exceptional at getting the work done well and on-time, but their custom millwork is always so impressive! They worked with Kyle and Angela&#8217;s mid-century modern aesthetic and came up with this gorgeous walnut custom cabinet system that I assure you will never wear out, but only wear in, as this lucky couple grows into their space. For their backsplash, the homeowners went bold with a bright green mosaic tile, <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&#8217;ceef 5 in lime green</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Along with opening the kitchen came operation living-room-update-and-integrate. This meant that although that rich orangey/yellowish wall color is one of beauty, it needed to be refreshed and made more current with a clean, modern white. Underfoot, the old parquets were replaced throughout with new flooring in unstained white oak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10722 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10723 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Although transitioning to a more modern aesthetic, Kyle and Angela wanted to keep a vintage vibe pulsing through their new space. The couple mixed mid-century based furniture, including a set of classic <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eames molded plastic/wire dining chairs</a>, a pair of vintage Heywood-Wakefield side tables, and a period-inspired <a href="https://www.radiusstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elite Four walnut credenza</a> by Radius Innovative Design, with more current pieces like their <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble and stainless steel portica table</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10724 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">One of the best parts of tracking home renovations is seeing how people choose to highlight the art and objects that make up their personal collection. Throughout Kyle and Angela&#8217;s living area, the couple showcases their very impressive collection of prints by California-based artist, <a href="https://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shag</a>, and mid-century album covers by illustrator <a href="https://www.jimflora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Flora</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10725 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Over the dining table, they were able to bring some of that green from their backsplash out of the kitchen in another retro accent, <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation&#8217;s Astron Tri chandelier</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10727 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela could not have been more excited to finally be rid of the outdated (Home Depot-centric) bathroom decor that they had come to love to hate (scroll to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it here</a>), in exchange for their bright new, modern and material-rich space. The deep soaking tub from Kohler is cloaked, like the walls, in super white subway tile, and floating beside it is a dark oak Fresca Vanity with Versa faucet, both from <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a>. I personally love the texture that the carrera marble tiled floor adds to this sleek space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10726 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">All in all, this home looks great and I can&#8217;t get enough of the true personality inside. Many thanks and congrats to the happy homeowners, Angela and Kyle! Also, big thanks to Sweeten Expert Kris, Natalia, and the rest of the team for the excellent work in making this home a whole lot sweeter!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-billy-sallys-diy-project-begins-w-thesweeten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we introduced you</a> to a Brooklyn-based couple who have just completed the renovation of their 775 sqft Fort Greene flat: Billy, a freelance web developer (currently at <a href="https://www.paddle8.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paddle8</a>), and Sally, a <a href="https://www.sallypaul.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painter</a> and museum educator at MoMA, ICP and the American Museum of Folk Art. Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s project got started on Sweeten with preliminary construction work by Sweeten member <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ecostruct llc</a>, and subsequently finished up with a full kitchen update and flooring replacement carried out by Billy &amp; Sally themselves (&#8211;some of which is also documented <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> on Billy&#8217;s renovation blog). The couple, along with their kitty, Lil&#8217; Miss, recently invited us back to show off the gorgeous results. Their new space is cozy &amp; bright, and, after being put to the test over the holidays, is also a perfect venue for cooking &amp; entertaining!</p>

Throughout the apartment the parquet floors were badly worn and the ceilings showed significant water damage. The kitchen, which was tucked away in a maze of walls, was a tight &amp; dreadfully generic space.</p>

Here in the entry we have our first glimpse of the new flooring and the open kitchen. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38588 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Billy &amp; Sally selected a light and modern-looking floor surface of engineered hickory that could actually be installed on top of the existing parquet floors (more on the install <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/2012/09/05/flooring-install-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). So, leaving the old parquet surface intact, they removed only the small area of kitchen tiles and replaced them with a layer of sub-flooring before finally working their way through the entire apartment with <a href="https://www.lumberliquidators.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the new hickory boards</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38589 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />In the kitchen, ikea cabinets with <a href="https://www.berensonhardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berenson pulls</a> look clean &amp; modern, and since they&#8217;re more budget-friendly than custom cabinets, the duo was able to splurge on well-designed appliances. We especially love their new Bertazzoni range (available online <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Other new additions include a refrigerator by <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> and a sleek dishwasher by <a href="https://www.blombergappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blomberg</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38590 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black countertop and undermount stainless steel sink and faucet after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Similar to the cabinets, the new kitchen <a href="https://www.ikea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sink</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faucet</a> are also from ikea. <img decoding="async" title="small-open-kitchen-and-dining" class="wp-image-38591 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg" alt="small open kitchen with floating shelves and peninsula island and dining space after renovation" width="723" height="1044" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-208x300.jpg 208w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-600x867.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Above the new kitchen island, the couple chose a pair of all-white pendants which were purchased on ebay.  The open shelving in the far corner is made from ikea <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NUMERAR</a> countertops that were cut to fit and mounted on elfa brackets (available at <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Container Store</a>). These shelves remind us a lot of <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-lucky-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the unit ecostruct built for Amanda</a> last summer. <img decoding="async" title="open-shelves-and-white-kitchen-cabinets" class="wp-image-38592 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and open shelves and stainless steel appliances and black countertop after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />One of Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s favorite new features &#8211;and another worthwhile splurge&#8211; are their lovingly-polished <a href="https://www.soapstones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soapstone</a> countertops. <img decoding="async" title="peninsula-kitchen-island-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38593 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="peninsula kitche island with black countertop and pendant light and hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Looking back into the living area, it&#8217;s clear that cooking is now a social activity rather than a private one. <img decoding="async" title="floating-book-shelves-in-living-room" class="wp-image-38594 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="floating book shelves on white wall in living room with hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />More open shelving in the living space makes for lovely &amp; efficient storage, as well as a nice display alongside the couple&#8217;s unique art collection. Best of all, the repeated shelving details weave this space together with the kitchen.</p>
<p>BIG thanks to Billy &amp; Sally for sharing their beautiful renovation!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This apartment would benefit from a soft, bright palette of materials to  keep the rooms, which receive most of their light from the back  windows, light and airy.</p>
<p>I would start by painting the walls and ceiling in an off-white color and installing a durable, light-colored flooring material throughout.  Maple and bamboo are both good choices.  With a natural stain and light varnish the fine grain of these woods shows through and they&#8217;re easy to clean.  A simple wood base of the same material wood will give the walls a neat finish.  The new wood doors, door frames, and window frames would be finished to match.  For the kitchen I&#8217;d use cork floor tiles, which are soft to stand and work on, modern maple cabinets, and dark countertops.  For the bathroom I&#8217;d stick to traditional white ceramic fixtures, and use black and white ceramic tiles on the wainscot and floor.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="174" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>A cream- and honey-colored palette for furniture complements the wood flooring and also adds warmth.  Contemporary pieces that stand up off the floor keep things feeling light and airy. I&#8217;d mix in a few more substantial pieces too, perhaps a coffee table from reclaimed wood, or an old-fashioned upholstered sofa.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Full-height sheer white curtains along the back wall will provide privacy while letting in lots of light.  I&#8217;d use simple bulb-shaped ceiling mounted light fixtures, and hang a special, more ornamental one above the main living or dining area.  Darker colored wool rugs or sisal mats can soften the living areas and pull seating arrangements together.  Brightly colored pillows, wall hangings and throws will add depth and cheer to the rooms.  Red, orange and brown would all be strong accent colors.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="343" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This apartment is going to make a stylish, comfortable  home for someone.  I can&#8217;t wait for her to come in and start sweetening!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1095 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>
