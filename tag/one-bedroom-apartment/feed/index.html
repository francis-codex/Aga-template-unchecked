<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Sharing a one-bedroom, postwar condo in Manhattan’s iconic Flatiron neighborhood feels like as much of a rite of passage into adulthood as it does into New York City life. Living on her own, Whitney, a finance associate, would find a new way to view the home she owned and a host of modern amenities in those same 800 square feet. But uncovering her apartment’s solo-living potential took some work, such as renovating the bathroom and kitchen and installing new flooring. Whitney <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a>  to</i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i> </i><span class="s3"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a Sweeten design-build firm</a> to turn her starter unit into sophisticated living quarters for one.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Few people can say that they relish living with roommates, but moving from a sheltered college town right into the middle of Manhattan, I missed having friends and classmates around. So I decided to share my apartment—an 800-square-foot condo inside a postwar high-rise. The living arrangement brought familiarity as I adjusted to my post-graduation working life, and it really helped me feel more rooted. (I had been traveling and living abroad since elementary school.)</span></p>

I also knew that if I were to ever sell or rent my apartment out, I’d have to make some changes or give the space a facelift at the very least. This felt like a good time to just go for it, so I decided to renovate the entire place and enjoy living on my own for a little while.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39540 size-full" title="entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="s1">To backtrack a bit, the apartment hadn’t been remodeled since the ‘90s, which means a lot of the finishes were dated. (Parquet floors are nice, they’re just not my style.) And when I shared the space with a roommate, I wasn’t into many of the design details or really even taking great care of the place. The apartment just didn&#8217;t speak to either of us, in all honesty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once I decided to live alone, however, I wanted something that I not only cared about, but that reflected who I am. It also needed to reflect the current decade and be functional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first thing I did before starting the renovation was to load up on inspiration and visit open houses in my building and neighborhood. That’s where I got the idea to install floor-to-ceiling doors throughout the apartment, which really draw the eyes up and accentuate the high ceilings throughout the building. The entry door to the apartment was already floor-to-ceiling, so this really helped unify the look and make it more consistent.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aesthetically-speaking, I had a strong point of view on what the newly renovated space would look like. I knew I wanted a black-and-white color palette throughout and that I have a soft spot for dramatic silhouettes and proportions with artwork hanging and leaning against the walls. This is where hiring a construction pro really helped because my vision wasn’t always practical or realistic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For instance, I was knob-averse for the longest time, meaning I didn’t want to have handles or knobs on my cabinet doors out of fear that they would break up the modern, minimalist look of the </span><span class="s5">kitchen</span><span class="s1">—and the entire apartment for that matter. My Sweeten general contractor warned me repeatedly that there would be no way to open the doors. Despite that, I stuck to my decision until I moved back in and realized that there was actually no way to open my cabinets! Of course, they were right all along.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39537 size-full" title="white kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02.jpg" alt="white kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="s1">For the </span><span class="s5">kitchen</span><span class="s1">, I replaced all of the appliances, took out the walls (a half wall and the upper cabinets), and created an open, airy flow between the kitchen and dining area that really highlights the waterfall countertop and counter seating. I also refinished all of the AC units throughout the apartment so they’d blend more seamlessly into the walls.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s5">bathroom</span><span class="s1"> got new fixtures as well, along with new tile in two different patterns of pale marble (a basketweave for the floor and subway tile for the walls). Installing a glass shower panel made it so I never have to deal with a moldy curtain ever again. It also opens up the space, which has no windows, so it <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looks larger than it is</a>.</span></p>

It was a compromise for me that worked out in the end: I had more than enough storage space and I was able to maintain the streamlined look I was going for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Using one color theme throughout the </span><span class="s5">apartment</span><span class="s1"> ultimately allowed me to flex my sense of humor in some places (see the Seletti Monkey Lamp), and take risks in other spots, such as the mirror-covered hallways, which was actually a nice mistake. </span><span class="s1">I had originally planned to have only one </span><span class="s5">wall mirrored</span><span class="s1"> as part of a dressing area. But due to a miscommunication, we ended up mirroring the entire hallway. The effect was quite stunning and brought in so much light and drama. It makes me feel like I’m on a runway when I walk through from the bedroom to the closets and bathroom while getting dressed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39541 mb-0 size-full" title="mirrored closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06.jpg" alt="mirrored closets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I ended up swapping out the parquet flooring for wide wood planks and repainting everything black and white, including black window frames and matching shutters. </span><span class="s1">Keeping it classic sounds simple enough, but choosing the right shades of black and white, ones with just the right undertones for the lighting in my apartment proved tricky. I have a high-floor, north-facing unit, and things look much cooler when the northern light and blue-ish sky comes streaming in. This meant I had to pick shades with a bit more warmth in tone and matte in their finish.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39731 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09.jpg" alt="bedside table" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It was the same deal with the floors. Though I’d set out to get really light wood flooring, I went with a shade that looked substantially darker in the showroom. The result? This beautiful pale neutral wood that, once installed and illuminated under the natural light, ended up being just what I wanted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before I started the project, I was consumed with all of the choices I’d have to make between what I wanted design-wise and the things that would enhance the value of the apartment. I was lucky to be able to navigate and negotiate those decisions with the help of my general contractor.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39539" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04.jpg" alt="wall with portraits" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My Sweeten contractor was also there to help me nail down decisions that would ultimately enhance the value of my apartment. Coming from a non-technical background, it was sometimes hard to convey my design ideas, but he made sure to align the technical aspects of the project with my aesthetic, he was quick to respond and follow up, and he was not afraid to be creative, take risks, and persist until things were done right.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From one first-time renovator to another, I think it pays to plan ahead and have a full vision before bringing other team members on. </span><span class="s1">In the end, the design process ended up being my favorite part of the renovation. It was a practical exercise in working within a timeframe and budget— which were my two biggest concerns at the start of the project—and it’s been rewarding to see my vision come through.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After years of traveling, living in foreign countries and cities, it means the world to me to have my own space in a city I identify with.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ink was barely dry on the closing papers of their new Brooklyn Heights co-op when Hari and Kaity decided they were ready to renovate a number of areas in the one-bedroom apartment, with the kitchen at the top of the list. The cramped galley space came with issues that could clearly be improved, and both Hari and Kaity also felt that their bathroom was past its prime. Here’s a look at dramatic upgrades in both spots. Check back next week for the full living room and bedroom reveal!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17510 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg" alt="hari-kitchen-bathroom3" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-17481"></span>The kitchen in Hari and Kaity’s new place was cheery but filled with dated tile, attempts to overcompensate with bad lighting, and appliance placement that seriously cut into counter space. The windowed bathroom had great potential and had been carefully kept up, but Hari and Kaity saw opportunity for smarter storage and a chance to customize the tile with chicer selections. As first-time renovators, the couple decided to <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their renovation project</a></strong> on Sweeten and we matched them with <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Jamal</a></strong>, who was ready to help the couple settle into a home complete with major updates in every room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17507" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like most residents with NYC-style galley kitchens, Hari really wanted theirs to feel more open and emit more light—especially since this kitchen did not come with a window, as many do. The previous owner overcompensated by adding lighting strips to the tops and bottoms of the cabinets, but the kitchen’s layout was the real issue. Jamal got to work, designing a plan that would expose more of the room to the home’s entry and living area, relocate a key appliance, and expand storage and counter space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17513 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17487" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jamal’s team cut into the kitchen’s entry door frame and brought the fridge a few feet outside of the kitchen’s walls, which in return allotted for more counter and cabinet space. They yanked old floor tiles and installed large, textured stone-like tiles in their place. New dove gray IKEA cabinetry with silver hardware plus a taller line of upper cabinetry, some with glass paneling, replaced the shorter set of originals. Hari and Kaity chose smooth white Caesarstone for the countertop and decided on white subway tile for the backsplash in a herringbone pattern, incorporating the classic yet modern aesthetic they were after. Under-cabinet and interior-cabinet lighting now brings a warm, inviting glow and stainless steel appliances (plus room for a brand new paneled dishwasher!) completed the turnaround.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Jamal set his sights on revamping fixtures and finishes for a more stylish and functional retreat. Hari and Kaity hoped to gain a little extra storage space, but otherwise, the upgrade would be fairly straightforward and relatively cosmetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They chose a classic basketweave floor with marbled tiles and expanded the chic black and white look up the walls with white, undulated subway tile lined with a glossy black border. Jamal introduced a shower niche for subtle storage and replaced the old pedestal sink with a modern version that offered more room for soaps and daily necessities. Hari and Kaity kept the same mirrored medicine cabinet and pendant lighting, added a simpler set of glass shelves, and opted for a new Toto toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hari and Kaity love the new kitchen and bath, and we can’t help but be psyched to showcase the innovative work in the rest of this home next week. Get ready for stunningly lovely refinished floors, picture frame molding, and envy-inducing closets!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We know first-hand how daunting it can be to envision renovation options as you&#8217;re standing in a crowded open house. This week, we are beyond psyched to share a first look at our new partnership with <a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corcoran</a>, New York&#8217;s preeminent real estate group. We&#8217;ll be partnering with Corcoran to help buyers and sellers demystify the renovation process, understand design options for particular properties, and break down potential upgrades at various price points. Over the next few months, you&#8217;ll see more information for first-time buyers about how to value renovations for properties on the market, ideas for new homeowners looking to undo the renovation decisions of prior owners, and guidance for sellers looking to maximize their re-sale value or refresh a property before it gets listed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our first video take, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> founder and CEO, Jean Brownhill Lauer, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kent</a> run us through kitchen renovation options, in under a minute, for a <a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/2840734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-bedroom apartment</a> on the market for $525,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc/listings/display/2840734"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10990" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02.png" alt="SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02" width="600" height="200" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02.png 659w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02-300x100.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02-600x200.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the budget in the $10k &#8211; $30k range, Jean focuses in on the most immediately visible elements of the kitchen: new tile and backsplash, under-cabinet lighting, painting cupboards, and a possible high-impact splurge on new countertops. With a $30k &#8211; $60k budget, Jean and Kent help us picture a more transformative project: opening the kitchen up to the living room, creating a custom prep and dining island, bringing millwork finishes from the living room to new kitchen cabinetry, and re-doing the kitchen floor. Now press play!</p>
