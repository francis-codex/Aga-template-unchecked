<h3>Elevating the best aspects of home</h3>
<p class="p8">We have been living in this apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, since 2015. It was the first place we lived together, and it felt like a real 1980s loft, which Sue and I liked a lot. The previous owner was crafty—he’d installed his own kitchen cabinets, and the spirit of the place was very DIY. Sue works in Fin-tech and I am in interior design. We didn’t do much work when we first moved in, thinking it made sense to let the apartment evolve.</p>

<p>The apartment comprises approximately 900 square feet. It had many vantage points, which our cat, who recently passed, really enjoyed. The neighborhood seems to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of industrial building conversions</a>—a church here, a school there, made into residential apartments. Our building belongs to the latter group, and was converted more than 30 years ago. Visitors are often amazed at how wide the hallways are. That sort of space is not something you often encounter in NYC.</p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Honing in on the shared lifestyle</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Looking to build on the apartment’s openness, we made a few changes early on. One was removing a spiral staircase and replacing it with an industrial-use stair; it remains in the same location in the current iteration. Another was taking out an idiosyncratic shelving system that the previous owner had installed. We are both utilitarian, and that aspect of our personalities influences our aesthetic.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-staircase-leading-to-loft" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg" alt="View of the black staircase leading to loft along with dining area and kitchen after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50882" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="dining-area-with-open-shelving" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg" alt="Dining area with open shelving unit overlooking the black staircase leading to the loft after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50881" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We also like this word that the Dutch have, <i>Gezellig,</i> which translates to something like coziness. It’s not a style, per se, but achieving it was a driving force for our renovation. We didn’t want an overly designed space, but rather one that felt <i>considered.</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Practical launch pad to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated our renovation</a> to coincide with the water boiler warranty expiration. Each unit has its own boiler, and you always hear about these things failing shortly after their warranty goes. We figured we would try to avoid becoming a statistic. Another <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivation to upgrade</a> was the desperate need for an electrical panel overhaul in the apartment. </span><span class="s1">We wanted to add an in-unit washer and dryer and a shower to our powder room. In addition, the apartment lacked, and desperately needed, built-in storage. </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We posted our project, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> was a great help in providing a list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant contractors in Brooklyn</a>. Since I work in this field, I did not utilize other services the company provides. I wanted to complete the renovation within an allotted time frame, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep within a firm budget</a>. Our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor proposed great ideas</a>. We had a few conversations before the renovation, and she was very accommodating. </span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Design tricks-of-the-trade</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It is always exciting to see a project on paper come to life, but it is especially interesting when you have an experimental client—in this case, ha!, ourselves. Our contractor convinced me that we should open up the entry foyer, which I wasn’t sure of. But in the end I think sacrificing the extra storage was worth it to expand the passageway. We also separated the passthrough between the dining and living space with an oversized barn door, which disappears when retracted.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We employed other tricks as well. Take the painting and color scheme, for example. We applied a World War I ship-camouflage technique known as Dazzle—which was a way of masking the volume and shape of military ships using geometric patterns—to try to make walls and objects more or less vanish into the space. We used black behind the TV to have it blend into the space. It is also a nod to the blackboard that would have hung on the wall in this former classroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stayed with a pretty strict material palette just because it is easier to manage and is also a fun challenge to stretch the limit of the material. For example, the black countertop and black backsplash is actually a paper-based product that is extremely durable. I also used it as treads for the stairs.</span></p>

<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Being flexible during the process</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No matter how simple you aim to keep it, in any construction project, there will be challenges to overcome. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved out of the apartment</a> during the renovation, but I went to the job site every other day to make sure we were moving forward. During one visit, I noticed that the contracting team had framed one of the walls in the wrong location. Instead of losing time having the contractor demolish the framing and restart, however, I decided to redesign that portion of the space. I did it overnight. In the end, we were able to salvage the work and it turned out nicely. It felt serendipitous. </span></p>

</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Laying out the plan for high ceilings</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners closed on an 850-square-foot loft apartment in a multi-building complex in Greenwich Village, just a short stroll from Washington Square Park. The building dated to 1890 and had formerly housed a cast-iron factory. The apartment itself benefited from the structure’s history with high 16-foot ceilings and original detailing. The interior finishes were outdated, however, since it had been decades since the last renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47451" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg" alt="loft homeowner" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They planned to convert the one-bedroom apartment into a two-bedroom while making full use of the ceiling height. A mezzanine level around much of the apartment would allow for storage and display of their art and decorative pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen was tucked away in a dark corner of the loft, with dark wood cabinetry and black countertops adding to the gloom. It made more sense to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap the locations of the bathroom</a> and the kitchen. This brought the kitchen closer to the the dining and living spaces. The bathroom itself needed a gut renovation. Its finish materials and all the wiring and plumbing were deteriorating.</span></p>

<h3>Out with the debris, in with the light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As their Sweeten contractor began to demo the space, he unearthed&#8230;actual earth. The contractor found about eight inches of “some kind of dirt floor” beneath the flooring. He had to excavate it along with the rest of the demolition debris—a first for this seasoned contractor. He speculated it was perhaps due to the building’s past as a factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They worked to create a gallery-like space featuring bright white walls, highlighted with blackened steel accents. Keeping the finishes simple allowed the airiness of the space to shine.</span></p>

<h3>A triumph of clerestory windows</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there are now two bedrooms rather than one, the homeowners were able to preserve a sense of expansiveness by not taking the walls all the way up to the ceiling. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clear glass clerestory windows</a> were installed</span><span class="s1"> in the bedrooms, as well as in the bathroom so that natural light could still shine in each part of the renovated loft. </span></p>
<h3>An integrated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the hallways, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, a steel rail was installed for a custom library ladder, to give access to the mezzanine areas. This unique system used brushed steel for the rail and brackets, and black-anodized aluminum for the portable ladder, to make it light enough to carry from room to room. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Storage-12-scaled.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the living room lost a few feet to create the second bedroom, it gained plenty of linear feet in display storage as a result of the loft renovation. Custom black steel bookcases run along the length of one wall. The contractor secured these shelves through to the studs as they were rebuilding the apartment, so they&#8217;ll be able to handle any load. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The living room space opens up to the dining nook, which also houses an upright piano. An <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g2262/gallery-wall-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjacent gallery wall</a>, decorated with black-framed art, provides visual interest along the interior wall. Recessed lighting and statement pendants support the minimalist aesthetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47429" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47433 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg" alt="library ladder" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<h3>Extra storage for the bathroom</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the smaller bedroom next to the kitchen, they created a lofted sleeping area for guests with a simple mattress set-up, which is also accessible via the library ladder. The elevated sleeping loft allows the floor area of the room to be used by the homeowners as a closet and dressing area. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47427" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg" alt="loft bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom received a similarly modern treatment with a deep soaking tub. A matte black towel hook and shower and sink fixtures create contrast, and match the overall black-and-white motif. Unusually, the homeowners were able to add storage above the shower area, also accessible with the portable library ladder. As with the overhead kitchen storage, the space above was built without shelves or compartments, to accommodate large or odd-shaped items. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple now has a beautiful home that handles their storage, showcases their art and treasures, lets in the light—and even lets them share their space with overnight guests.  </span></p>

<p class="p3"><em><span class="s1">This is what Europeans-turned-New-Yorkers, Uldis and Serge, saw when they stepped into a loft in a 1929 industrial building in Manhattan’s Midtown East: soaring 12- to14-foot ceilings, floating steps to a steel and tempered glass mezzanine, and 10-foot windows overlooking a tree-lined courtyard. They were sold on the historic feel and open concept but a remodel was in order including a full kitchen installation, new lighting, and reworking the layout to fit a master bedroom.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My partner, Uldis, and I are both from Europe. We have been dreaming of New York for quite a while before we were able to move to this very special city. </span><span class="s1">Initially, we stayed in a rental apartment. At some point, we decided to buy our own place. </span><span class="s1">When we viewed our new home, we liked it right away and made up our minds fairly fast! </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42360 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="portrait renovating homeowners" width="1000" height="1471" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev-204x300.jpg 204w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x883.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our new 800-square-foot former studio is located in a historic property in Midtown East. Originally built in 1929 as a design school, the 27-story tower was briefly home to a print factory. In 1979, its careful conversion to an apartment building was noted with the First Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects. As a condop, the building combines all the magnetism of a graceful prewar property with the flexibility of a condo.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We liked the overall structure of the apartment. However, we wanted to slightly change the layout to create a master bedroom. The plan was to also rebuild the kitchen, repair and repaint the floor, walls, and ceilings, and upgrade the bathroom and lighting throughout the apartment. In addition, we sought to incorporate eye-catching details of American Mid-century modern style to soften the space and make the place feel homier.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My genuine interest, passion, and experience in design allowed us to renovate without an architect or interior designer. One of our biggest <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenges was to find a contractor</a>. This was our first renovation project and we didn’t know where to start. We were grateful to discover Sweeten which helped to connect us with our general contractor. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The biggest upgrade was in the former kitchenette. There was a sink, a few kitchen cabinets, and a few appliances all installed alongside one tiny wall. There were also several kitchen carts to allow for some extra storage. We saw the potential and decided to build a full kitchen.</span></p>
<p>We used an online design service to prepare a 3D design rendering, which included floor plans, elevations, and materials to buy. When our kitchen design was ready, we purchased our kitchen confidently, knowing everything would work.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">We wanted to keep this open airy feeling. Yet, we still wanted a separate master bedroom. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To use all of the space available, we opted for an L-shape layout that forms a &#8216;grotto&#8217; underneath the standing loft. </span><span class="s1">The gas range moved to the back wall as well as the microwave, which serves as an under cabinet range hood. At first, we wanted our kitchen to be all in white. However, in the end, we decided to mix contrasting colors and finishes with the upper cabinets in a high gloss white and stainless steel cabinets on the bottom to anchor loft-like details. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42378 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a.jpg" alt="bathroom, glass backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">We chose a black tempered glass backsplash for a luxurious feel along with a white ceramic sink and white quartz countertop for a sleek look. </span><span class="s1">The brushed brass and nickel accents—also seen in the rest of the home—were chosen to create a dramatic contrast.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42381 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04.jpg" alt="studio loft before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It wasn’t practical to mount any ceiling lights under the mezzanine overhang. Instead, we used integrated kitchen lighting panels to completely cover the underside of the wall cabinets to spread more light all over the kitchen. Besides, a swing-arm brass wall sconce was installed to cast additional light. </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The second biggest upgrade was to divide the room into two parts. We liked the existing modern open floor plan and stunning living room bathed in natural light. We wanted to keep this open airy feeling. Yet, we still wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate master bedroom</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We chose sliding doors with translucent cloud acrylic inserts to separate the space. They let natural light through but also give privacy. Because of the structural simplicity and lightweight design, the whole construction was installed without a floor track which helped us achieve a clean look.</span><span class="s1"> Our Sweeten contractor built a soffit to hold the sliding doors and hide new electrical wiring. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In our spa-inspired bathroom, we painted the ceiling, replaced the grout and fixtures, and installed new bathroom hardware. Since storage space was limited, we installed a floating high cabinet with a mirrored door to store bathroom essentials. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We had planned to paint all the walls white but decided to paint some walls in gray while keeping opposite walls in white. That’s where we encountered 250 shades of gray! </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It took us several days to decide on the shade of gray which would elevate other elements of the design that were already existing in the space—an oversized mirror made from antique surveyor sticks, an old 1929 old clock face from an NYC building and 1920s klieg lights from a 1920s movie theater. </span><span class="s1">We love the way our warm brass fixtures, mirrors, and pieces of our décor highlight the gray’s blue undertones. </span></p>
<p class="p1">We also had to slightly update a 20-foot of closet space. Finished with seven-foot frosted tempered glass sliding doors, our oversized custom-designed closets needed some repairs.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The next step was to fix and refinish the African wenge hardwood floors. We used a True Black stain by Minwax to achieve a sleek modern look.</span><span class="s1"> Our floors are a perfect backdrop against light walls and neutral-toned furniture and accents. </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To accommodate multiple zones stacked on one another, we installed track lighting from the hallway to the bedroom to cast bright warm light, creating a sophisticated environment. Our contractor was very helpful in the lightning upgrade and recommended sources for most of the fixtures. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The renovation process took longer than we had originally hoped. This was due to the renovation approval process and the busy schedule of our contractor. </span><span class="s2">Yet, w</span><span class="s1">e remember this as a positive experience which made us appreciate what we have now!</span></p>

<h3>A style fix</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel’s Long Island City, Queens, loft boasts 15-foot ceilings and loads of natural light. The apartment’s kitchen, however, didn’t suit the couple’s Scandinavian, minimalist style. It lacked counter space, the sink was smaller than standard, and the to-be renovators just weren’t vibing with the finishes. They wanted integrated appliances with all clean lines and everything stowed away in cabinets or drawers. The rest of their home has walnut and matte finishes throughout, so they knew they wanted a similar aesthetic in the cooking space, too. The couple, a creative director and software engineer, who also has a three-year-old son, </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/36746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>New cabinetry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with a clear perspective, the couple got to work with their contractor to reimagine their kitchen. Gabriel used the Ikea kitchen planner tool to lay out the space, exploring its customization offerings to suit their needs. The cabinetry is all Ikea but modified to cover the appliances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wall cabinet containing the range hood is shorter and wider than the surrounding units but is still covered by the same door size. The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size to not only fit into the existing space, but also align with Ikea panels. “The fridge hunt was probably the single largest use of our time. Ask my wife about chasing our son through AJ Madison,” Gabriel said. Their contractor ended up cutting a 36 inch Ikea panel into three pieces to integrate the refrigerator with the walnut cabinets. They also fit in a cabinet right next to it. All of the drawers and wall cabinets are equipped with LED lighting, adding to the custom feel.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Patience from their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sleek aesthetic carried throughout their material choices, from the matte black faucet, lack of cabinet hardware, and a single slab counter and backsplash without any seams. “Our contractor was very patient with all my crazy ideas and helped me make them actually work,” Roxana said. “He helped brainstorm a lot of the Ikea ‘hacking’ and was very patient with us,” she continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for their new kitchen? “It feels modern, calm, and welcoming. It fits our needs and it feels like home,” the couple shared. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gabriel used an app called Sketch Up to mock up the kitchen and ensure everything would fit with the existing plumbing fixtures. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A flexible, sunny space makes a happy home—and a good investment</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30365 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>It was brimming with potential: a corner, prewar loft on a main street in Greenwich Village. The apartment took full advantage of its southern and western exposures with oversized, industrial windows that wrapped around two sides of the loft. Much of the space was open-plan with 14-foot-high ceilings; a mezzanine above the kitchen is accessible via a charming spiral staircase and can be used as a guest bedroom or home office.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30366 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30417 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>The homeowner saw an opportunity to add value to the apartment by taking advantage of its structural beauty and abundant natural light. The building was converted in the late &#8217;70s from an industrial manufacturing space into residences and the unit had been relatively untouched since. Parquet wood tiles and warped cork would be replaced, and the decades-old kitchen and bath desperately needed a makeover. A few tweaks to the layout would also maximize the space to its full potential as an investment and a primary residence. He decided to go for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30368 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30406 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing the co-op apartment, the homeowner lived in it for six months before renovating. Modern finishes would be a more suitable backdrop to the gorgeous natural light that poured through the six oversized 10-foot windows. He also decided to use pocket and barn doors for a seamless look and flexible use of spaces. Enter <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. The homeowner <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> and was matched with a Sweeten design-build firm, and they got to work to fulfill the vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30370 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30373 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they ripped out the kitchen’s outdated Formica counters and &#8217;70s-era cabinets, and completely gutted the old bathroom. The kitchen ceiling was cut away from the windows by about 18 inches to make more of the windows visible. An entryway closet was reduced so that the view from the kitchen window could be seen from the entrance of the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor on the mezzanine was also pulled back from the window and outfitted with a railing along its edge. The hardwood was repainted; the ceiling was scraped and painted, setting the stage for a guest bedroom, office, and additional closet storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30371 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30372 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s standout feature is the Carrara marble backsplash and 2-inch-thick countertops with a waterfall edge. Ikea cabinets with blue-gray fronts offset the white marble and are adorned with simple hardware in a satin nickel finish. On the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> side of the kitchen’s U-shaped counters, refrigerator and freezer drawers are tucked discreetly underneath to reduce visual clutter and maximize space efficiency. A stainless steel undermount sink is matched to an industrial faucet and sprayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the side of the peninsula that faces the living room, the ledge of the counter was extended to create a space for bar seating with built-in 12-bottle wine storage as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the homeowner chose to continue the marble theme with herringbone floors, a warm subway tile on the walls, and the same 2-inch-thick Carrara marble from the kitchen as a counter. With a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless glass divider</a>, the deep soaking tub does double duty for baths and showers. Three well-placed niches, including one inside the tub area, add storage for toiletries and small décor objects.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom, which benefits from one of the apartment’s enormous west-facing windows, was slightly reconfigured. The previous owners had installed floor-to-ceiling shelving with a library ladder, which was a good concept but needed to be scaled back. In its place, the Sweeten contractor built open shelving across the length of the room, keeping it within the overhead space so that it didn&#8217;t narrow the feel of the room. When its sliding doors are open, the space feeds into the living room for an open feeling. When the doors are closed, however, there is total privacy in the bedroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30380 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dressing room and closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closet</a>, which was initially small and located inside the room, was relocated into a newly-created walk-in dressing room between the bedroom and bathroom. The homeowner wanted a closet with plenty of space on three walls for clothing and accessories. The design is perfect for couples, allowing one person to sleep peacefully while the other is getting ready for the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, the outdated flooring was replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural white oak</a> in 7-inch-wide planks. Sourced from Vermont, the new floorboards—long rift and quarter-sawn—show a &#8220;tigering&#8221; striped effect and are perfectly suited to the space, making a stylish first impression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mixing luxurious touches with economic ones, the Sweeten team was able to achieve the modern and fresh aesthetic that the homeowner imagined. What did he learn from his renovation experience? “Hire the right contractor and stay very close to the project. I feel like I made every micro decision, but it worked out! The unit looks great and I am a happy customer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tara and Ryan turn an industrial space into a warm family home</h2>
<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC. When the couple, who now have a 19-month-old son, had a chance a few years ago to buy into the neighborhood, they jumped at it. Despite the architectural details within their newly purchased loft, the space was outdated and a partial wall was used to create the only bedroom in the home. Here’s the story of how Tara and Ryan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> to renovate their 1,200-square-foot co-op apartment.</em></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Tara and Ryan</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, we had the opportunity to buy a loft in a former silk importer warehouse and fell in love with the possibilities. The space showcased several classic neighborhood features, such as cast-iron Corinthian columns, 13-foot tin ceilings, oversized windows, and exposed brick walls. However, it also needed a lot of work. The kitchen and bathroom were dated. The bamboo flooring was uneven. There was no storage and the only bedroom had a divider instead of a full wall. We lived in the space for a few years while we considered our options. Then we got pregnant with our son, Wyatt, so we decided to act fast to make room for our new family addition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-expose the brick</a> along the entire length of the living room wall. It was a similar case in the master bedroom, where we wanted to add an accent wall. The columns and original tin ceiling would be left untouched; we loved their rustic, industrial character. That raw look would contrast with the clean, modern, and white gloss cabinetry in the kitchen and living room built-ins that we wanted. The brands we chose were based on quality, modern aesthetic, and resale value.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were unsure of what to expect when the brick in the living room would be exposed. In addition to finding a few more steam, electrical, and drain pipes than expected, we also uncovered a square archway (the brick wall was a firewall running down the center beam of the building and the arch was a former large doorway from its time as a warehouse). During the co-op conversion, these archways were covered by standard framing and wallboard to separate the apartments. However, the feature was aesthetically unpleasing. We solved the problem by covering the drywall and turning it into a “feature wall” with reclaimed barn siding. Finally, we showcased the wall with down-lit recessed lighting—an idea we got from a movie. To keep the décor minimalistic, we made maximum use of our new storage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> along much of the living room wall are compartmentalized for baby toys, books, media, and our vinyl collection. On the opposite wall sits a desk for paperwork and musical inspiration; Ryan has played the guitar since he was 13 and hopes his son, Wyatt, inherits his passion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen, we essentially kept the same layout. We had looked at several floor plan options that would have potentially altered the kitchen/bathroom layout and location. After exploring those options, we realized moving those “wet” spaces over our downstairs neighbor’s “dry” living room would drastically increase the cost and complexity of our project. We did push the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> out (toward the dining area) about a foot. That improved the ergonomics of the kitchen, particularly when navigating an inconveniently located cast-iron column. We replaced the cabinets, which gave us the flexibility to tweak the functionality, such as replacing the range on the former island with an induction <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. That left room in the island for three rows of deep drawers, which was a much better use of space for storing pans, utensils, and cookware than cabinets. We also found room to add an 18” wine fridge in the island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall and speed oven combination</a> moved to the back wall, formerly dead counter space for a microwave and toaster oven. We did consider whether the column would interfere with the kitchen flow, especially with ovens on the other side. But it ended up working out fine. The high-traffic area (sink, refrigerator, cooktop) is together on one side of the column. The sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator were replaced but stayed in exactly the same locations, requiring minimal plumbing. Even though we added appliances, we gained storage space just by reconfiguring and making better use of the space we had.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-dryer combo unit</a> had been in a column directly facing the kitchen island, a terrible location for laundry for traffic flow—and hygiene. The water heater was directly above the washer-dryer, making the whole section difficult to move. The simple solution was to rotate the units 180 degrees, so that laundry door was accessed next to the bathroom, which made more sense. The water heater was left as is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A big priority was to formally close off the master bedroom. Working with a 100-year-old former warehouse came with some challenges. One was a column near the bedroom. Although it is beautiful, it just happened to get in the way of every floor plan. Working with our architect, we had to be creative in positioning the bedroom walls in a way to maximize their floor space while working around the columns. Using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pocket doors</a> helped solved the problem since the column would have left no room for standard hinge doors. Storage was a priority throughout the loft. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master closet</a> is a wall-sized, reach-in, modular custom closet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the baby’s room, we took some space from the living room to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the second bedroom</a>. Carving out the space was a challenge when constrained by the column, windows, door placement, and not taking too much square footage out of the master. In the end, we were just barely able to segment an 8-foot x 10-foot room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had a clean, modern makeover with oversized floor-to-ceiling marble tiles. The floor plan stayed the same, but we were able to make substantial improvements with a few minor design adjustments. Once we demo’d, we found that the half-height wet wall behind the pedestal vanity was overbuilt and could be moved inward. This reclaimed a few inches of space needed for the new floating vanity. We also framed out a LED-lit, recessed shelf above this wet wall, giving the area more purpose. The medicine cabinet was set inside the wall, saving some airspace. These little adjustments made the wall feel a few inches deeper and between the shelf, floating vanity, and medicine cabinet, it provided a lot more storage. Above the bathroom’s dropped ceiling, and with a lot of maneuvering, we made space for the blower of the new ducted central air system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is common in New York City, our apartment was heated with building-controlled steam heat. Our unit got a disproportionate share of that heat. In frustration, we removed the steam radiator altogether while adding a heating and cooling central air system. We also replaced the worn-down bamboo tiles with new white oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/">hardwood floors</a> throughout the rest of the apartment, <span style="color: #333333;">which we painted a designer white. </span>It keeps the whole space feeling open and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was great in helping us realize our vision. They understood our scope of work and did a great job at pairing us with excellent contractor options. Then, they walked us through the contractor selection process, helping us make an apples-to-apples comparison of the bids. The Sweeten contractor we ultimately chose to work with turned out to be an excellent pick. They became true partners in our process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One tip we want to pass on to future renovators is, if possible, rent a place close by so you can check in a few times a week. We did and were able to do weekly (sometimes multiple times per week) walk-throughs with our contractor. That gave us time to plan, troubleshoot, and exchange creative ideas. They also used software to track all aspects of the project, including timelines, material selections, work pictures<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>all of which was tremendously helpful and well organized, allowing us to complete our project within the planned four months. Sadly, a friend’s renovation that is similar to ours and started at the same time is still going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting part of this process is seeing our vision come to life. And getting storage because babies come with so much stuff!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A Manhattan bath gets new fixtures and finishes nearly 15 years later than planned</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Nancy and Aram purchased their 1-bed, 2-bath, 1,500-square-foot loft apartment in 2000 and made updates throughout the space soon after moving in. A few years down the road, they realized the work in their Chelsea bathroom was not up to standard: the subfloor wasn’t stable and as a result, the penny tile kept popping up. The wall tiles fared only slightly better, and other finishes were showing their age. The pedestal sink proved to be inadequate for their needs, with no countertop space or storage beneath. A tub, original to the home purchase, was unnecessary since neither Nancy nor Aram enjoyed baths. But one of the original bathroom renovation ideas they kept was the cabinet that they had installed during the first remodel, with its custom cut-out for their cat, Floyd, to access his kitty litter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: With grand visions of a wide, spacious shower and a reconfigured floor plan, Nancy and Aram <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a><span class="s1">, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors </span>and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose this Sweeten contractor</a> to execute their plans. Unfortunately, they discovered early on through a walkthrough with an architect that the Sweeten contractor recommended that their dreams were not code-compliant. Specifically, their desired layout would not provide the required clearance in front of the toilet, as specified by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They regrouped and proceeded with the project, opting to keep the old footprint and changing out all the fixtures and finishes. Nancy had wanted a patterned terrazzo or cement tile for the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and pored over dozens of virtual and physical samples. Ultimately, it was Aram who chose the new floor, spotting it just as they were heading out of the tile store: a black-and-white ceramic tile made to resemble the Moroccan-inspired cement options that Nancy had liked. (Fun tidbit: the couple hauled hundreds of pounds of tile in their car to NYC from the tile store in Hillsdale, NY, where they had previously renovated several baths in their second home. They were, shall we say, very committed to their upstate tile lady.) With the centerpiece flooring picked out, they chose a beveled white subway tile to complement it. A 1/3-offset installation gave the traditional tile a nice sense of flow. In place of the old tub, their contractor installed a shower with glass walls and a sliding glass door (a smaller version of what they had originally envisioned). For walls and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinetry</a>, they chose <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/find-your-color/color/887/pink-cloud?color=887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this shade</a> of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/why-millennial-pink-refuses-to-go-away.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">millennial pink</a> while in a state of distress the day after the presidential election—but were surprised to discover that they still loved the color, even after the shock subsided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Nancy agonized over the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a>, given that space required unusual dimensions. A custom-ordered Duravit vanity with an integrated sink and countertop fit the bill, coordinating perfectly with their overall bathroom renovation ideas—it didn’t block Floyd’s kitty litter access and was shallow enough while providing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> for small items that Nancy wanted within easy reach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Black-and-white ceramic floor tile, white beveled subway wall tile, penny shower tile: Country Town Marble &amp; Tile (Hillsdale, NY).

<p>Since it&#8217;s practically invisible, a glass shower enclosure is a one of our favorite bathroom renovation ideas for a smaller bathroom. In Mary Ann&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/88-year-old-master-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master bath</a>, the glass shower makes the space to feel open and bright.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Chenta had been looking for a new place for about six months when they visited a duplex apartment in the former home of the Ridgewood Times, a local newspaper of record in the area. They fell in love with the space and saw a lot of potential in it. The creatives—Michael designs sweaters and Chenta is a director in web design—were drawn to a warm but minimalist look, and knew immediately how they could alter the apartment to achieve their desired surroundings. The prewar industrial building was situated in Ridgewood, Queens, right on the border of Brooklyn, and dated back to 1932. It also briefly housed a school, and then was converted to condos in 2009. The structure&#8217;s original industrial elements, including steel beams and wood materials, concrete floors, high ceilings, and great expanses of windows, were preserved in the conversion. The space was everything that Michael and Chenta were looking for, with an interesting history to boot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While they were in contract on the property, Michael and Chenta began reaching out to general contractors independently, but felt overwhelmed. They would call contractors and hear nothing back. Michael then <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/12757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project</a> to Sweeten’s site, explaining they wanted to reveal the concrete floors under beaten-up hardwood planks, and to create a new closet system for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master suite</a>. The couple was matched with several experts, and ultimately decided on their Sweeten general contractor. The contractor and her team worked with the duo to achieve the right combination of concrete, wood, metal, and paint colors to produce what Michael called a “modern Scandi style, but without the Boho elements.” They wanted “clean and simple lines, but we&#8217;re also trying to not make it look too cold or sterile.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of the biggest changes, the contractor’s team first ripped up the wood flooring to expose the concrete floors underneath on both levels of the duplex. They next applied an Italian product called Wall2Floor, a concrete-based mineral coating that had to be applied by hand to the existing substrate. The application creates a seamless surface and is usually used in luxury spaces. It gave the apartment floor a polished, sleek texture and paired nicely with the wooden banister and kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the streamlined effect, Michael and Chenta asked their Sweeten contractor to remove baseboard moldings and door frames. This accentuated the gallery-like feel of the loft space: walls were floated—meaning that the drywall stops short of the floor, and is not covered with base moldings, and when closed, doors were completely flush with the walls that surrounded them. Their choices of warm white paint in the living area and dusty pink in the living room provided a warm contrast against wood, metal, and concrete.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the master suite, they made layout changes to accommodate a walk-through (rather than walk-in) closet. The existing closets on the left wall were demolished, and a floating wall was created to section off the closet area without closing it completely. “It’s all very open with a lot of natural light,” Michael explained. New custom closets were designed with metal framed interiors and floor-to-ceiling oak doors and placed to face the new wall. They also opted to paint the walls inside the closets dark gray for more depth. All the hardware was finished in a matte black. “We didn’t like any of the standard finishes, so our contractor made the changes to help us achieve the clean lines and simplicity that we were looking for,” said Michael.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25189 mb-0 size-full" title="concrete floors and stairwell" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg" alt="concrete floors" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Michael and Chenta worked with their Sweeten team to ensure that each step was smooth. But like many renovations, there were some hiccups: they had to move in before the renovation was finished since they didn’t want to continue paying rent when they had started paying their mortgage. They waited until the concrete floors were finished (and protected with a plastic sheet), and then <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lived through the rest of the work</a>. “All our moving boxes were stacked in the middle of the living room, and we were sleeping on an airbed in a construction site,” describes Michael. Despite this, the couple felt that their contractor “was great from the beginning. She understood our vision and always had great ideas. She was the kindest person and talked us thoroughly through the process, even when Chenta and I had meltdowns.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael’s advice to would-be renovators? “Stay calm and put some money aside. It will work out in the end, but you will be over budget. It was a system that we weren’t familiar with, and although I understand how to create a product, I didn’t realize just how complex it would be to renovate an apartment. It takes so many steps to even properly <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paint</a> a wall! And all these little things need to be done to create a great end result, although they seem unnecessary when you are not familiar with the process.”</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Michael, Chenta, and their cat Taiger for sharing their showcase apartment with us!</span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A loft apartment rediscovers its historic roots by exposing its beams, maximizing 11-foot ceilings, and bringing the walls down</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24990 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23868 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald had a dream: he wanted to live in a loft apartment. His current home, a 1,800-square-foot house in Elmhurst, was definitely <em>not</em> a loft, but it was ideal for him and his wife in many other ways. It was close to both of their jobs, as well as to both sets of parents, and they loved having a backyard right off the kitchen. So they decided to do the next best thing: make their home as &#8220;loft-like&#8221; as a house could be, most notably opening </span><span class="s1">up walls so the space would have an airy feel. Finally, it came time to tackle the tight, closed-off kitchen. Here are the details on a long-awaited kitchen renovation (and a few extras!) befitting two avid cooks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23870 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23862 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23860 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23865" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After living in his home for close to ten years, Romuald knew that a new kitchen could dramatically change how his family used the space. He and his wife love cooking together, so they wanted to create a new kitchen in which two (or more!) people could comfortably work. Upon his wife&#8217;s recommendation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">turned to Sweeten</span></a> for help and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his <span class="s2">contractor</span></a> for the project. The original kitchen featured dark wood cabinets and felt cave-like because of a wall separating it from the main living space. Wanting to demolish the wall, it was necessary to regain the storage space by adding an island. It also afforded an extra work surface and an unobstructed sightline across the whole first floor of the house for a loft apartment feel. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Working with their contractor, the couple came up with a plan for their new kitchen. The original flooring was a tile that contrasted with the hardwood running through the rest of the first floor. They wanted to continue the wood look but opted for a gray “wood” porcelain that would be much easier to maintain (important for a kitchen that sees a lot of action!). <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-custom cabinets</a> made it possible for creative storage solutions like an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; (details below) to be incorporated into the kitchen plan. The warm gray cabinets they chose from <a href="https://www.waypointlivingspaces.com/cabinets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Waypoint</span></a> coordinated with the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>. A white quartz countertop and classic marble subway tile for the backsplash brought a clean yet contrasting look. Above the stove, they installed a pot-filler to save the job of hauling a heavy pot of water from the sink on the island to the stovetop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23866 mb-0 size-chrono" title="microwave" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" alt="microwave" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald and his wife started shopping around to replace all of their appliances with the exception of their investment appliance—a <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Thermador</span></a> range with blue knobs. After visiting appliance stores and making product choices,  he came across one of his favorite finds—the microwave drawer! A built-in microwave was placed high on their wish list so that it wouldn’t take up valuable counter space like their previous one did. When he came across the drawer, he knew that it was the way to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Next, their Sweeten contractor suggested the genius solution of an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221;—a much-loved-but-seldom-seen feature in city apartments. This storage unit would house their toaster, coffeemaker, as well as a few odds and ends, with outlets built into the back keeping a tangle of cords contained. With the “garage door” lowered, the counters would look instantly cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In the spot where a dividing wall originally stood, they installed an island. While they had intended to build one about six feet long, it ultimately expanded to a 10-foot-long island—a decision that Romuald doesn’t regret one bit. “We can fit four stools along one side, while the other side has enough space for our farmhouse sink, microwave drawer, and dishwasher—and with storage room, too!” Given the space now has the open feel of a loft apartment, they can now watch the TV in their living room from the kitchen. Romuald explains, “We have it on a swivel, so we just swing it around and can cook and watch TV at the same time. This is great for unwinding after a long day’s work.” They also love the way that the breeze flows through the entire space when they open the door to the backyard—something that wasn’t possible with walls in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23861 mb-24 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While the project took a bit longer than anticipated due to delays in delivery of materials, Romuald reports that they are very happy with the way it all turned out. And although they had intended on just renovating the kitchen, the project expanded in the end to include new floors throughout the entire living space, as well as a new railing for the stairs leading to the second floor of their house. All of these changes have made their house a dream home for the couple!</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here at Sweeten, we understand that pairing the correct architect and client is more than circumstantial, and that the best working relationships are based largely on shared visions and philosophies. This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/portfolios/448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea gut renovation</a> project brought together Sweeten member firm Future Project, co-owned by Pedro Pachano and Ampara Vollert, who specialize in exploring theories of space and sensory discovery in their architecture, with an art collector client who wanted more than just a space to showcase her individual art pieces. The art-loving homeowner was looking for something that would act as a flexible framework for her entire collection and lifestyle.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The apartment&#8217;s original layout was made up of a number of smaller rooms that varied in floor height, which did not allow for two key aspects that the homeowner specified for her remodeled home: to be able to entertain large numbers of people, and to have significant wall space for her collected works.<span id="more-10514"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10516" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg" alt="01_living" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By removing a series of interior walls, integrating a diffused lighting system that creates flattering light for the homeowner&#8217;s many dinner parties, and using wide plank, white washed maple flooring and continuous, white walls and surface planes, the renovated apartment can now be experienced as an expansive space that is punctuated with art and views of the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10517" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg" alt="02_kitchen-entrance" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Pedro and Ampara created a similarly expansive yet more personalized experience by using materials that engage both the senses of vision and touch. Here, custom, white Corian cabinets create uniform planes which are even used to hide the appliances, and a nice plus is that the Corian panels are pleasant to the touch. Knowing the homeowner&#8217;s propensity to entertain, the Future Project team designed a custom cantilevered island. The island is topped with an ocean blue resin surface like the countertop and backsplash which creates visual depth in the space and “relaxes the eye.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10518" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg" alt="03_family" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10519" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg" alt="04_family-2" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Discovery&#8221; was a theme Future Project worked with in their design, and we love how they used this idea here in the den area with this unique paneled wall system. The polished Rosewood veneer panels open to reveal a series of interior spaces, each with its own color of polished lacquer paint and unique function. One door leads to a guest bathroom, another to a roll-out closet system, and the one above opens to a colorful custom bar installation by a contemporary artist.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10536" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg" alt="bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s a peek into the guest bath, one of our favorite rooms in the apartment. This space features a custom vanity and shower construction made of grey Corian with mirrored edges which make for a unique, fragmented optical illusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10520" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg" alt="05_master-bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom is equally blue and oceanic. The walls, floor and ceiling here are tiled in 1&#8243; <a href="https://www.glasstile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oceanside Tessera glass mosaic tiles</a>, and the vanity is custom in white Thassos marble.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10521" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg" alt="06_bedroom" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because she entertains so frequently, the homeowner wanted the option of a guest room, but at the same time did not want to give up her home&#8217;s open, gallery-like quality. Pedro and Ampara came up with a smart solution to accommodate both needs with a custom sliding wall (for separation) and second bed that&#8217;s all stored beneath the master bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10522" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png" alt="08_double-wine-hallway" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As if we needed any further proof, this homeowner&#8217;s wine closet is yet another testament to her hostessing skills &#8212; so, when&#8217;s the next party?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Great work and many thanks to Future Project&#8217;s Pedro and Ampara for sharing their work with us; we look forward to seeing more from these designers, soon!</p>
