										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;"><i>When designer, Whitney and her fiancé, Laurence, moved into their 1,000-square-foot co-op in Forest Hills, Queens, they were prepared to create a home to accommodate their newlywed lifestyle and different work schedules. First on the list: remedying a series of separate and awkward bedroom closets—one of which was within another closet (!). They sketched a walk-in closet and dressing room with better flow, re-stained their floors to a modern finish, and combined their belongings from their previous places, all with the wedding date fast approaching. They reached out to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and by project end, they loved the results so much, they extended the job and added to their scope.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Guest blog post by Whitney in Forest Hills, Queens</i></p>
<p>We looked at so many apartments. We stopped counting at 50. We felt discouraged after being outbid on two other apartments by all-cash buyers. But we kept coming back to this apartment. It was different than the others. It was spacious and the wide-open views, natural light, and Southern exposure were alluring. We were willing to overlook the years of wear because it had potential. Ultimately, we were seduced by the view of the Manhattan skyline. Having both lived in NYC studios for over 15 years, Laurence in Sunnyside and me on the Upper East Side, the large bedroom was certainly a plus, but the awkward closet layout was cumbersome.</p>
<p>There was a typical small closet with a simple rod and shelf configuration that had a bi-fold door that could only be opened if the bedroom door was in the closed position. A four-door, full-height mirrored built-in unit concealed the door to the small walk-in closet. In effect, there were four separate closets none of which were completely accessible to the other.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22589 size-chrono" title="closet renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-Before-02-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-Before-02 (1)" width="723" height="1085" /></p>

<p>This clumsy arrangement did not work for our lifestyle. We have different work schedules—I&#8217;m an interior designer, Laurence is a bartender in Manhattan—and are respectful not to disturb each other in the early morning or late evening. Knocking down the quirky closets to re-create one large dressing room was the best solution.</p>
<p>Careful planning and meticulous measurements of this new space still allowed for two large chests of drawers and a king-size bed in the bedroom without compromise. Our feng shui consultant advised us on our furniture plan, design and artwork placement to bring positive change, harmony and balance into our home. This was our first home together as a married couple and we wanted to honor it with good vibes. Sketched out on paper, we designed a master bedroom that felt grand and spacious. We wanted to get started right away since we had recently combined households, were living in a studio, paying for two overflowing storage units, carrying two mortgages and maintenance bills, and getting married within the month.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Even though I&#8217;m in the design industry, my go-to contacts were booked. I decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post my project</a> on Sweeten, and was lucky to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a> who had the level of workmanship that met my high standards. He was courteous, professional and punctual. On our first meeting, he was in the lobby waiting for our arrival. With our plan and vision, he was right in step as we discussed what was possible within our budget. Reading Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovation cost guideline</a> helped us know what to expect and how to budget for the project.</span></p>

<p>In addition to the dressing room, our wish list included refinishing the floors, replacing the baseboard, and painting. We love the basketweave effect of the original parquet floors, but preferred dark wood floors to feel grounded on the 14th floor. Our contractor&#8217;s positive attitude brought forward creative solutions for our scope of work. While it was cost efficient to preserve the floors, he explained that they were very thin and refinishing them was a risky job. Willing to take the risk, we gave him a color wood sample to match.</p>
<p>After demolition, it was evident that some of the flooring could not be salvaged. The exact same parquet floor was sourced to replace areas in the dressing room and elsewhere in the apartment and looks seamless. He also removed a layer of linoleum in the foyer which revealed the original parquet so now the floor runs throughout, making it feel expansive.</p>
<p>Great progress was made in a short amount of time before we left for our honeymoon, and not wanting to break the momentum, our contractor sent us a text shortly on the first morning after we departed for Amagansett. (We appreciated how he staying in communication with us!) The flooring subcontractor had just mixed three custom stain samples on the floor, and they needed an answer immediately. Luckily, one of the samples was spot on, and they went straight to work. Then we received a call the next day to let us know that the floors did not come out to his satisfaction. He was going to redo them at no additional cost to us, but reiterated his concern in sanding the floors again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22590 size-chrono" title="closet renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>We returned from our honeymoon and to our delight the floors were gorgeous! We were so happy with the walk-in closet that we asked our contractor to transform the linen and coat closets, too. He was great, the initial job came in on budget, and he advised us of the cost of change orders, billing us appropriately for the additional work we requested along the way so there were no financial surprises in the end.</p>
<p>The investment we made in the apartment and the value-added renovation has enhanced our lifestyle. If space is a luxury, a dressing room is the ultimate luxury.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each week, we aim to translate insight from Sweeten experts into information you can use to make better decisions about improving your home. This week and next, let&#8217;s take on flooring. I might be biased, because new floors were the very first step I took in renovating my tiny East Village apartment, but I cannot possibly think of a better way to get a bigger bang for your buck. If you are looking to transform the way your home feels, you can do it with new floors in less than a week&#8217;s time. For proof of its impact, scroll through these flooring selections some of our favorite homeowners have made in the last year. <em><strong>Next week, check back for the full low-down on the process and cost of re-doing your floors.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11524 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Williamsburg, <a href="https://sweeten.com/2013/10/31/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot renovated</a> with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the first floor of their townhouse. The natural knots and irregularities serve as a counterpoint to the clean cabinet lines and modern lighting fixtures. I&#8217;m always amazed at how<span id="more-11520"></span> simple white walls set against warm wood tones makes a space feel clean, bright, and relaxed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela replaced their Clinton Hill parquet with white oak, left unstained. The simple color and texture of the new floors is such a smart complement to the custom walnut millwork, saturated green accents, and mid-century modern decor that makes this home so unique.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, a homeowner combining three apartments unified the space with a custom engineered white oak floor from Master Floor, an Italian company. The planks are pre-finished with a matte effect, which keeps your eye focused on these incredible views and amplifies natural light throughout the apartment without adding any glare.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen of their Brooklyn row house, Allison and Jovito chose a porcelain tile, finished to look like wood. For extra visual impact, they laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. Porcelain was an especially smart choice for these cat owners: tile is more durable than softer wood materials and is easy to keep clean in a high-traffic area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Chelsea, this homeowner, an architect and designer, kept the wood floors that were original to the iconic London Terrace building but transformed them with a matte black finish. The decor choices throughout this apartment are so glamorous &#8211; this dark matte finish helps diversify the feel and gives a little bit of grit and texture to the space.</p>
