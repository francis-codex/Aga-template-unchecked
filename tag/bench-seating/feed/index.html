</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Opening up a claustrophobic layout</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Be patient and be bold,” Can Vu Bui, a Brooklyn principal at <a href="https://oo-t.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Things</a>, a collaborative architecture and design studio, likes to tell his clients. This was his mantra going into the main floor gut renovation of an Art Deco–era rowhouse in Glendale, Queens. Bui’s slow, steady approach led to a striking result.</span></p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h5></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners had been living in the home when they hired Bui, and were ready for dramatic change on the brick building’s first floor. They planned on revising the existing layout to bring air and light to a chronically dreary space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After coming up with a concept reflecting light modernism,</span><span class="s1"> Bui created a project plan and posted the job on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our website</a>. They worked with the homeowner to review bids and portfolios before hiring a contracting firm in Queens.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Starting out, the team had their work cut out for them. “The house’s primary problem was a direct product of its 1920s design,” the architect said. The brick-and-mortar building, surrounded by townhomes, had a narrow, chopped-up floor plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenges of opening the 600-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main floor space</a>, according to Bui, were abundant. A load-bearing masonry wall blocked light from reaching the living and dining rooms. Walls that separated the stair, kitchen, and dining area inhibited flow, creating “small, claustrophobic” spaces, he said.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">“We designed custom millwork that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench.”</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51433 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg" alt="Image of the family room with black couch and arched entry to dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-51441 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated dining room with view of stairway and built in storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Art Deco-approved arches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The light and space problems at the top of Bui’s task list were only the beginning. “This project presented an opportunity to fix those pragmatic issues,” he said, but also to pull together and “artfully unify” the divided ground floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Door frames and wall openings were inconsistent, but the building held some inspiring original details. Fortunately, a few with gently rounded upper corners caught the architect’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bui envisioned sloping designs to link the spaces together. “We replaced existing walls with elegant structural arches,” the architect said. “The rooms open generously into each other, allowing light to pour into the home’s interior.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Stairs open up with storage</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the desire for openness and light, maximum storage space was still needed for functionality and day-to-day life, particularly in New York City homes, according to Bui. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to his plan, the general contractor opened the wall between the existing stair and dining room, removing a large, square center section. Next, the contracting team revised the staircase, adding a landing a few steps from the base and then introducing a turn, so that the last few steps led into the dining room. The changes helped the narrow stairs and small dining room feel instantly less claustrophobic.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51448 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18.jpg" alt="Image of an open stairway with custom storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51449 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg" alt="Image of built-in storage with drawers and cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the breaking through of the wall eliminated key storage space. Bui found a fix. “We designed <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom millwork</a>” surrounding the new wall opening, he says, “that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench,” as well as custom handrails. In the end, a partially exposed stairway brings light and drama to the home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paint colors and bright finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls and the interior planes of the arches are painted in muted shades—green, ochre, and blue. Curved millwork is also seen on a full wall of open storage in the dining room. The brushed oak is stained with a hint of gold. Brass accents bring warmth to the rooms.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51442 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="Image of a newly renovated kitchen with checkerboard floor and green walls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51444 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated galley kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Many homeowners and designers fear color,” he said. “It makes sense—you don’t want to be stuck with the wrong one.” The architectural team worked closely with the homeowner throughout the process, providing renderings, tests, and mockups to prevent surprises. For instance, the shade of gold on the walls in the foyer and dining room carefully bookends the space without overwhelming or darkening the area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The pale <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green in the kitchen</a> and reading nook plays homage to classical French country homes,” Bui said. The effect is an inviting color path leading one through the house. “Our goal,” Bui said, “is to let color boldly elevate the feeling of a space.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architect + Sweeten general contractor = Teamwork heaven</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the process, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and Sweeten general contractor</a> worked together closely, executing Bui’s vision. “As architects, we spend a lot of time designing custom details—our relationships with the contractors who can make them are critical. It’s great to work with craftspeople who bring insight and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertise to the project</a>.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, Bui explained, the renovation made over the once spiritless space—it feels bright and modern, but not harsh or humorless. Furthermore, color and flow now have a direct impact on the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comfort one feels in their surroundings</a>. “This is a home, after all,” Bui said. “It should feel special.”</span></p>
