<h3>Remodeling an outdated 80&#8217;s West Village kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36013 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36010 size-full" title="jonathan-standing-in-kitchen-with-wife" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg" alt="jonathan standing in his kitchen with his wife in front of white kitchen cabinets and herringbone pattern subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="waterfall-marble-island-with-pendant-lights"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pendant lights and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36013 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36018 size-full" title="waterfall-kitchen-island-with-cabinet-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pull out drawers inside cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Samantha</span></i></span></p>
<h3>Recreating an under-used garage</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running their creative agency, VERSUS, in New York City takes up a lot of their time during the day. So Samantha Louise Barnes and her husband, Justin, like to </span>relax at their weekend home in Fairfield County. It&#8217;s located in Weston, which is a quaint small town with tree-lined streets, good schools, and notable architecture. The town is known for its mid-century modern architecture and their home is no exception. It was built in 1948 by architect Lloyd Flood, who was an early associate of architect Edward Durell Stone.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>The couple shares the home, which was previously renovated, with their two-year-old rescue cat, Louise. Set on a dead-end street, Samantha wanted to make the most of her 1,750-square-foot home. That meant converting the garage. They rarely use the second bay. Samantha and Justin take their car to the train station every week and leave it parked there until the weekend. So what to do with this underutilized space? Create that ceramic studio Samantha had always dreamed about, of course.</p>
<h3>In search of a contractor</h3>
<p>Samantha wanted to get the renovation done quickly—preferably in a month’s time. So she started researching, pricing, and locating the equipment needed for the soon-to-be ceramic studio. It was challenging but she found a kiln in South Carolina. Apparently, a lot of people had the same idea to create a ceramic studio during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Once this was taken care of, she set her sights on hiring the right contractor for the job. She posted the project on Sweeten to find a general contractor. “[Sweeten] offered advice every step of the way,” said Samantha. “I felt confident that I would be happy with who they vetted.” Samantha and Justin hired a Sweeten contractor and the project began.</p>
<h3><b><img decoding="async" title="grey-and-black-industrial-design-storage-cum-display-unit" class="alignnone wp-image-50929 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15.jpg" alt="Grey and black industrial design storage cum display unit with open shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></h3>
<h3>Figuring out the layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to choose the shorter bay—made smaller by a closet located in the back—and converting it into the studio. Twenty-five percent of the closet would make space for the kiln while the other 75 percent remained as a closet accessible via the other garage bay.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Samantha also worried about getting the electric requirements correct. So, she worked closely with her Sweeten contractor and his electrician to ensure that the kiln would run safely. They gave the kiln its own outlet and dedicated breaker box.</span></p>
<h3>A ceramic studio comes to life</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of the renovation is a beautiful, artistic space. They kept the back window to allow light to shine through behind the kiln. And added another window above the air conditioner to give a bright airiness to the space. Their contractor also assisted with picking out the double French doors that replaced the original garage door. And figured out the right air conditioner/heating unit to match the electricity needs.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Connecting with the main house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the aesthetics, Samantha and Justin chose to keep some consistency with the main house’s design. For example, the flooring in the main house is a poured concrete so they went with that in the ceramic studio. The concrete fits in nicely with the artistic vibe of the space. Plus, it’s safe to use under the kiln and Samantha likes the “rough” look. The trim is the same as in the main house as well. Material choices and style were to keep a cohesive look and feel. </span></p>

<h3>Finding their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Samantha and Justin first started thinking about renovating, they knew it wasn&#8217;t going to be a big job. However, they did want to find a trustworthy, qualified contractor. &#8220;We are only at our home on the weekends, so we still consider ourselves new to the area and needed a jumping-off place to find someone,&#8221; said Samantha. &#8220;Instead of running through a slew of contractors on the Internet, I thought of Sweeten.&#8221; The result met all the couple&#8217;s expectations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you, Samantha and Justin, for sharing your dream garage remodel with us!</span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Get an edge by installing connected smart home technology during your home remodel</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48936 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg" alt="Image of smart home technology in a shower" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home technology is everywhere today. It has made its way into our vehicles, our workplaces, and our pockets. With smart tech’s skill at automation, it’s no surprise that it has found a perfect place in the home. Nearly<a href="https://cta.tech/Resources/i3-Magazine/i3-Issues/2020/January-February/The-Ringing-Future-of-Smart-Home-Technology"> <span class="s2">70-percent of homes</span></a> already own some type of smart home tech. And that number is only growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some forms of smart home tech are more permanent. Sweeten outlines which ones can best be incorporated during a home remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters and controllers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from being smart, the average water heater is more like a blunt tool. It maintains hot water even when you don’t need hot water. Or if you turned it down before a vacation, you’ll need to manually turn it back up when you return. It can take hours for the water to heat up again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters connect to your home’s internet through Wi-Fi. This gives you remote access to all of the water heater’s functions. You can adjust temperature and set schedules. You can even monitor the status and shut it down if there’s a problem. This gives you a chance to call in a technician and avert disastrous water leaks.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart electrochromic (self-tinting) glass windows</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a sunny climate, you know the constant routine of lowering and raising blinds to control inside temperatures. Even northern zones experience peak sunny periods during the summer.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass darkens or lightens automatically in response to solar changes throughout the day. No blinds are required and nothing physically moves. While the windows require power for this operation, the amount of power is minimal. For 2,000 square feet of glass, the electricity required would only power a 60V-watt light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass is truly cutting-edge smart home technology. It is still not widely available. But it is worth looking into if you live in places with heavy solar and heat demands.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart connected appliances</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do all of your home’s separate appliances work as one? Probably not. Likely, they perform their own duties separately. A new and smarter option is to consider them as components of a larger system. According to<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/smart_home_tips"> <span class="s2">EnergyStar</span></a>, appliances with connected functionality use less energy than conventional appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a two-part system. One, you’ll need to purchase smart appliances with that next big remodeling project. That includes refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, and dishwashers. Two, you’ll need a unifying management system that can recognize and operate those appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EnergyStar’s SHEMS program is one program that is available for free. Google Home is another popular program that acts as a hub for an ever-growing number of smart devices.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home security systems</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, “smart” was the missing link of home security systems. Home alarms would report to an off-site monitoring center. From there, a call would be placed to local police and to the homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But smart security systems put homeowners front-and-center and keep them informed. That information is dually shared with the monitoring center and homeowner in real-time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While wireless security systems are popular, wired systems do have strong points. Cameras with wires running through attics or behind walls are difficult to tamper with. A hidden or locked-up digital video recorder (DVR) records hundreds or thousands of hours. Wireless cameras with SD cards record a few hours before rolling over and erasing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart radiant wall heating</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On cold nights, hot air gushing from the central heating system’s vents is a welcome feeling. But if you were to watch with a thermal imaging camera, you’d see just how inefficient this is. Orange and yellow areas of warm air build up in some areas. Blue and green spots indicate places where the heat does not reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Large radiant heating panels mounted on the walls evenly distribute the warm air. A thermostat notices that the room is cold. It signals to a smart controller located in a separate area. That signal is relayed to a manifold, which sends hot water from a boiler to the radiant heating panels.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water monitors</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your home may already have a smart water meter on the street. Installed by the water company, this meter reports the level of your usage wirelessly to the company. This is what generates your monthly bill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a similar device that you own and control. A licensed plumber splices the smart water monitor (not meter) into your home’s water supply line. The monitor communicates with your home’s Wi-Fi system. With an app, you can track your water consumption and can make adjustments to save water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, a smart water monitor can sense unusual fluctuations in the water flow. These fluctuations may indicate a break in one of the pipes. Since the monitor is located at the start of the pipes, it can shut down all water to the house. This can stop devastating water line breaks before they happen.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart garage door openers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garage doors remote controls are helpful, but they have a very limited radius. With a smartphone, you can control a smart garage door from anywhere you have a cell phone connection. You might be halfway to work and you think that you forgot to close the door. With the app, you can verify whether you did. If so, you can shut it remotely. Or you might need to open the garage door because a neighbor wants to borrow your mower. Smart garage doors expand the reach of the old remote control.</span></p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay but choosing a few or even just one device or smart home technology system can offer a convenient way to stay on top of the inner mechanics of your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A self-proclaimed millennial&#8217;s first renovation in Midtown East</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sherry, a recent college graduate, was excited to make her family’s rental property in Manhattan into her first home. Once she got a job offer in New York, she knew it was time to remodel the outdated space. The renovation process started with a lot of compromise between Sherry and her then-boyfriend, but over time, evolved into a project all her own. After posting her project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, she chose the one she felt would bring her ideas for each room to life. Here, the journey to the final design of her first major renovation.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My family purchased an apartment in Midtown East during the height of the 2008 financial crisis and immediately turned it into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rental property</a>. While in Connecticut for college, I dreamt of moving to New York and making that apartment my first home. The property hadn’t been renovated since being built in the ‘80s and felt outdated. And there were practical issues to consider, including extensive water damage on the hardwood floors from a tenant who had left the living room windows open for weeks. When I started a job in New York last year, it was time to make my dream into a reality and take the plunge on renovating the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35608 size-full" title="living room before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg" alt="millennial apartment renovation, manhattan renovation, before, living room, sliding doors" width="1084" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg 1084w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35602 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, living room, kitchen, dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, I was planning on moving into the apartment with my now ex-boyfriend and we each had a lot of ideas for what needed to be addressed in the remodel. While I was mostly focused on making aesthetic and design improvements, he thought we needed to change the entire floor plan by moving walls and doorways around. As we were trying to find a compromise, we heard about Sweeten and decided some expertise and personal attention would be helpful in guiding us through the home renovation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with several potential general contractors who could make the changes we wanted within budget. We met with one who spent hours discussing all of our renovation ideas and possibilities in detail. We liked his vision and readiness to tackle the challenges of our space and knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he was the right contractor</a> for us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As we honed in on the details of the remodel, my boyfriend and I spent countless hours debating choices about tile, paint colors, and finishes. I realized the project wasn’t going how I had envisioned and about three months into the process, we broke up. I went back to the contractor and we agreed to scrap the original plan and completely redesigned everything in 48 hours. By the end of those two very stressful (but liberating!) days, we were ready to move forward.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35601 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, kitchen, counter, sink, refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my first priorities was to update the<span style="color: #000000;"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a> throughout the apartment.</span> I knew I needed to address the water damage in the living room and also wasn’t in love with the original floorboards, which were narrow and felt outdated. I wanted to update the space in a more modern and millennial style, which meant making design choices that had a sense of utility while also being simple, sleek, and refined. We installed beautiful, wide, oak floorboards that anchored the space in an elegant way and became the foundation for the rest of my design choices. There&#8217;s a sense of an overall artistic feel leaning toward urban chic (simple, cool tones).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to find ways to enlarge the<span style="color: #000000;"> living room and kitchen </span>as much as possible. We decided to remove a closet near the front door to add space to the living area while slimming the walls around the kitchen to keep it as open as possible. The decor was kept simple with lots of neutral grays and blues, which helped create the illusion of more space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom and bedroom</span>, however, would have strong design statements. In the bathroom, there were two: a beautiful, circular mirror with a beveled, asymmetrical frame that I fell in love with instantly, and the chevron shower tile (that I was inspired to use after looking through past <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten projects</a>!) I couldn’t resist adding two gorgeous sconces next to the mirror and lots of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in storage</a>. My Sweeten contractor helped bring these ideas to life within my budget; I made my choices for the lighting, the mirror, and tiles within the contractor’s app and signed off on each decision.</p>

I chose to build the design around a Nepalese rug I owned, which had earthy tones and hints of red. The contractors customized my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet</a> for me and painted one of the walls a soothing gray to complement the deep hue of my red velvet headboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, my experience with Sweeten and my contractors could not have been more positive! Everyone involved was great about communicating challenges while still striving to make my dream a reality. Now that my cat, Zelda, and I have moved in, it’s such a pleasure to get ready every day in front of my beautiful bathroom vanity and walk on my smooth, new, hardwood floors knowing that I hand-picked every element. Designing your space from top to bottom is something I would recommend to everyone—the sense of satisfaction and pride in your space is well worth all the work involved!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Lawyer-turn-entrepreneur Cassandre Davilmar, along with her business partner, Isiah Michael, saw something missing in her neighborhood: a place for healthy-minded people to gather for camaraderie and movie nights. She turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, to find a general contractor who would work with her and her interior designer. From greenery and bright colors to wicker light fixtures, they created a casual outdoor backyard indoors—an &#8220;oasis” between two major subway lines on bustling Utica Avenue. Specialties of the house: The Lakou Delight smoothie, Haitian patties, and PB&amp;G (Haitian peanut butter and ginger jam) sweet crepe.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT:</strong> <a href="https://www.lakoucafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lakou Café</a> opens its first location in the Weeksville neighborhood (also part of Crown Heights)</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> 195 Utica Avenue, Brooklyn, New York</p>

(<em>Above</em>) The café hosts community events, such as game and movie nights. (Check out the pull-down screen on the ceiling!)</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is your company and where did the idea come from?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> Our company is Lakou Café. I&#8217;ve been living in Weeksville, which is a community in Crown Heights that&#8217;s actually the first free black community. I noticed there were a lot of people interested in their health with local gyms and parks for exercising, but there wasn’t a good variety of healthy food options. I also felt there weren&#8217;t many community spaces in the area. I wanted to create a space where somebody can get something light to eat and at the same time get to know the people in their community.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you move from the legal profession to become an entrepreneur?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> I&#8217;ve always had an interest in business, but from childhood, I had a desire to be a lawyer because I wanted to help advance my community. While in law school, I developed my narrative that would lead me to entrepreneurship. I chose a career in corporate law working on private equity transactions, mergers and acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts. This gave me a deeper look at how CEOs and upper-level management evaluate strategic business decisions. I also got a deeper understanding of business modeling and financial projections.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With these tools in my back pocket, I was armed to tackle my next goal of entrepreneurship. I find it rewarding to imagine something, build it, and work on it until it succeeds (a constant challenge!). Also, it&#8217;s amazing to provide value to customers and to help employees find gainful employment. It may not be for everyone, but it&#8217;s definitely for me. In my specific case, my neighborhood needed a beautiful place for fellowship and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m able to provide an oasis for them.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does the new space design represent your brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> My family is from Haiti, and Lakou is a Haitian word that means backyard or courtyard. It’s a place where the community hangs out, where religious ceremonies take place, where herbs are grown, where people play, or just chill. I thought that was a fitting name for the space that I wanted to create.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We really wanted to be on the Utica strip, because it&#8217;s between two main train lines, where there are tons of people who walk by every day, but unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t find an actual backyard space. So we brought the outdoors inside with lots of plants and tables that look like tree trunks. We wanted a contemporary feel and added a cool twist like wicker lighting instead of wicker chairs. Bright colors like green or natural stone remind you of the outside. I think we did a good job making it feel a little bit like an escape.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Did your Sweeten contractor help you with any part of the design?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> We wanted a really long floating bench that’s probably about 20 feet. Our contractor was concerned that the weight of it might be a bit much, but we didn&#8217;t want a block bench. The wall that it was on originally didn&#8217;t have the brick exposed yet; we got rid of some it above the bench but not below. It kind of formed a little shelf underneath it so that we could place a bench on top and it would appear to be floating. It was great that he came up with the idea to help us get the aesthetic we wanted and still be able to support a lot of bodies and weight.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your experience working with Sweeten?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> I originally stumbled on Sweeten when I was just looking for contractors online. The contractor process is a bit more difficult mainly because a lot of people don&#8217;t want to refer contractors to you because they might have had a bad experience. Or some people feel even though a contractor had been good with them, they may not be good with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten’s Client Services reached out to us after I filled out their form online. They explained the process to me, asked more about what we were trying to do, and what our budget was. They found five or six contractors they thought would be a good fit for us to reach out to. It also felt a bit like a safety net. If a contractor wasn&#8217;t responsive, I could reach out to Sweeten.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34905 size-chrono" title="storefront during renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="restaurant renovation, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Haitian Cafe " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34908 mb-0 size-chrono" title="storefront after renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-11-723x482.jpg" alt="restaurant renovation, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Haitian Cafe " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had a lot of delays because of the signing of the lease, but Sweeten checked in on us every now and then to see where we were with that. When we finally did begin the bidding process, Sweeten offered for us to send them all the bids to compare the information. In retrospect, I probably would have utilized that more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most valuable thing about the service is it seems like the contractors really appreciate being a part of the Sweeten network and they don&#8217;t want to jeopardize that in any way. So their goal is to make me as happy as they can. I didn&#8217;t have a strong fear that if the project was done and things weren&#8217;t perfect—which they&#8217;re never going to be completely perfect—that I&#8217;d never hear from this contractor again. That&#8217;s probably the biggest pro in my experience with Sweeten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>Simple ideas for the cook space deliver a big impact</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you value a calm, clutter-free space to do your cooking, consider the sleek and minimalist approach of the modern kitchen. The formula is simple: flat-front cabinets, integrated appliances, and little visual interruption. If that sounds like a recipe for a room that feels cold and empty, think again. Here are six kitchens by Sweeten homeowners that combine personal touches with clean lines and carefully edited design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26356 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marissa and Cody’s</a> kitchen, an all-white backdrop of IKEA cabinets and a matte hexagon tile backsplash create a neutral base while the wood-paneled island and oak flooring add a touch of warmth.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31162 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a seamless look, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren</a> swapped her range for a cooktop, nestled within the quartzite countertop, and oven, disguised with paneling to match the surrounding blue cabinets. White floor tile in the kitchen visually separates the space from the dining and living room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20051 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening up the ceiling and exposing beams allowed <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris</a> to bring an unexpected industrial element into their kitchen. Another refreshing detail: horizontal cabinets that echo the bold lines of the ceiling. To tie the look together, the existing hardwood floors were sanded down and brushed with a soft matte gray finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21436 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kate and Arthur</a> took the opposite approach to the standard white kitchen and opted for black cabinets, matte black backsplash tile, and soapstone countertops.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Big personality comes home with a trough sink and a wine fridge—under the stairs</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27222 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowners Ed and Alicia with their dog, Roxy" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After Roxy, a rescued Rhodesian ridgeback, joined their household, Alicia and Ed realized “a little more space in a laid-back neighborhood” would be a better fit for the family of three than Manhattan, where they were currently living. They set their sights on a 1,400-square-foot garden duplex in a Park Slope brownstone. They fell in love with the building, which had been converted to condos by a developer about a decade ago. Despite the high-end finishes that were chosen at that time, there were issues that had developed in the interim. The couple also wanted to bring the renovations in line with their tastes, and in a style more befitting a building dating from the turn of the last century. As Alicia put it, “We really just wanted to make the place something we loved coming home to at the end of each day. What we had wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t terribly practical either<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>we had mismatched countertops, cracked tiles in the bathroom, a lack of counter space in the master bath, and most importantly, no space in the fridge to store our wine. The place just lacked the ‘wow’ you would expect from a building this pretty.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27245 size-chrono" title="before: kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27226 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27224 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>. For the couple&#8217;s custom kitchen renovation, Christina, their Sweeten Planner, was present at regular site visits and contractor meetings, providing detailed progress reports. Initially, the couple intended to focus their time and money on the kitchen. Instead, they also updated the guest and master bathrooms executing an overall vision<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>“a muted, classic design with a modern twist.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, this meant replacing the mismatched countertops as well as the cabinet fronts, and creatively finding space for a built-in wine fridge. Ed and Alicia knew that when the kitchen was renovated a decade ago the developer had used top-of-the-line materials, from custom Italian cabinetry to Viking, Miele, and Liebherr appliances; the space didn’t need a gut, simply a refresh. The downside of the custom Italian kitchen, however, was that none of the cabinetry was standard-sized. Refacing was a custom job, pushing out timelines, but it meant they could keep all the existing built-in shelving and customized organization that would have been extremely expensive to replace. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Countertops</a> resembling marble from Caesarstone unified the space and were chosen for their hardiness and durability. Ed had always wanted waterfall-edge countertops, which completed the look perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27225 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27227 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Chalkboard wall and wine fridge under the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had hoped to replace a smaller-than-usual refrigerator, as well as add a wine fridge. But the floor plan wouldn’t afford them the space for a larger unit, so they focused on adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine fridge</a> instead. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Ed and Alicia poked exploratory holes in the drywall underneath their stairs. Happily, they discovered that a 36-bottle dual zone wine fridge would fit in the space without making any structural changes. “It&#8217;s a luxury you would never think you could have in New York. We painted the surrounding wall with chalkboard paint<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it’s a great way to leave notes for each other, plan out our grocery list, and try out some amateur artwork,” they said. &#8220;As a bonus, we found the current kitchen fridge is more than large enough for our needs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The downstairs bathroom was next on the list<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it already had a great soaking tub, but the vanity and medicine cabinet were outdated. The tiles, too, were showing their age. Alicia had always loved the feel of a traditional New York City bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>penny tile floors, subway tile, and a classic black-and-white color palette. They replaced the sink with a trough style: “There was debate whether the sink would be too large, but after lots of measuring and imagining how close it would be to someone using the shower or toilet, we decided to do it. We are so glad we did. It is a perfect fit. We also went for the matching faucets and soap dish.” Having forgone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> under the new sink, they added a small shelf and a 1940s American Red Cross medicine cabinet (found online in Bulgaria!). The large closet just outside of the bathroom made up for the limited storage. Lastly, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung toilet</a> was a lot of trouble to install, but ultimately worth the effort, since it’s incredibly easy to keep clean and makes the room feel larger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27469 size-chrono" title="during: dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="exposed brick wall in the dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the renovation of the downstairs bath, the contractor discovered that there was preserved exposed brick along one wall. They hoped that the brick was in the same condition a few feet away in the living room, and asked the contractor to rip down the sheetrock where their dining table would sit. “It turns out we were in luck. The brick looked wonderful, and though we had to unexpectedly reroute some electrical cables and find matching oak to patch up the flooring, it was worth all of the expense and impact on the timeline.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27234 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27233 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom shower and tub" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the couple also decided to renovate the master bathroom upstairs. (One of the pluses of living through your renovation is that you can figure out what else needs work while the contractor is on-site!) Since Alicia and Ed moved in while the renovation was still ongoing, they lived with the space for a while and found the bath to be unsuitable in many ways. “The overhead lighting was terrible, and the illuminated mirror died the day after we closed on the apartment. There was the complete lack of shelf space for us to set things down while getting ready, and the leaking pipework rendered the vanity useless for storage. The space really felt unloved.&#8221; To give the room a facelift without breaking the budget, they kept the large soaking tub (same as the one downstairs), the flooring, and toilet. A new white shaker vanity with a marble countertop provided ample storage while an illuminated medicine cabinet and built-in LED lights lit up the room. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass panel</a> in place of the old shower curtain opened the space up. Lastly, a herringbone wallpaper from Ferm Living took the master bath to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They made the home “<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smarter</a>,” by adding outlets in convenient locations for their <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonos</a> sound system, converting regular to USB outlets where appropriate, adding a video intercom, and installing a full <a href="https://nest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nest</a> thermostat and smoke detector system. Now, they can control the temperature via Amazon Echo (thanks, Alexa!) and ensure that the apartment is a comfortable temperature for Roxy while they are away.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27241 mb-0 size-chrono" title="during: Roxy on the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="During" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although they’d hoped to finish the renovations prior to their move-in date, they ended up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the entire renovation</a>, which lasted four weeks from beginning to end. The toughest part, according to Alicia and Ed, was keeping Roxy out of trouble. (See above.) Their advice to future renovators? “Find a contractor you trust, and take their advice on what things would work well and what to avoid. We used tools like Pinterest, the Sweeten blog, and other online tools to get ideas. Also, if you have space, try to keep some spare materials once you have completed your renovation. We spent a long time trying to find a flooring that matched our current style to patch in around the exposed brick wall. We decided to buy an extra pack this time and store it in our basement in case of emergency. The same thing with all the tile. You never know what could happen in the future<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>for a few hundred dollars, it is worth the investment and peace of mind!”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Giving new life to an estate-condition kitchen and living room in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier had already lived in New York City as renters for several years when they made the decision to make the Big Apple their long-term home. This meant a move from the Upper West Side to Brooklyn, which they preferred for its pace and culture. Rentals were considered but ultimately rejected because of their notoriously small kitchens; the couple loves to cook and needed enough space to work together comfortably. An updated unit in the Clinton Hill Co-ops caught their eye—but unfortunately, they were outbid. Then, having fallen in love with the CHCs (as have many other Sweeten renovators before them!), they realized they could buy one of the units that needed work and have the money to spend on a custom renovation. They made their choice based on the layouts that had space for their ideal custom kitchen. In the unit they selected, everything had to go—the dingy wallpaper and paint, bad tile, and a kitchen that hadn’t been touched in decades. The only thing that would remain were the floors, which would be sanded and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a>. They decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> for the job after posting their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier achieved the “modern industrial, open-concept feel” they were looking for by demolishing the walls between the old pantry, living room, dining room, and kitchen. “We wanted a lighter feeling in the apartment, given that the ceiling is not particularly high,” Natalie explained. With less obstruction, the custom kitchen was brightened by the windows in the dining nook and spacious enough for the pair to host dinner parties. They also added plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> for storing all of their kitchen equipment. The sink and dishwasher moved to the wall perpendicular to the stove, allowing their Sweeten contractor to increase counter space and improve the custom kitchen’s overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flow</a>. The addition of a built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spice drawer</a> and cabinets with pull-out drawers meant that there was a designated spot for their kitchen goods—from small appliances to pots and pans. With many moving parts, Natalie and Cartier relied on Christina, their Sweeten Planner, to help stay on top of their renovation in real time throughout their home&#8217;s transformation. They even received a comprehensive digital record documenting their three-month renovation at completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Cartier was keen on having a “smart” home, so the living room air conditioning and many lights are connected via Wi-Fi and controlled by the Echo.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by Kristen, Clinton Hill homeowner</em></p>
<p>Before moving to Clinton Hill, I lived in a 450-square-foot studio apartment in Brooklyn Heights for 10 years. I adored that apartment, but was ready to move into a new space after maneuvering around a small home that had few windows and limited space for entertaining. This apartment, a co-op in the Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a complex with considerable Sweeten history!</a>) is nearly twice as large at 800 square feet, and had been converted to a two-bedroom by the previous owners. I closed on this apartment in August 2016, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a>. <span class="s1">I had been looking at the site for a few months even before I found my apartment so by the time I was ready to start construction I had a clear sense of how the process worked. </span><span class="s1">Once I selected a contractor, the team at Sweeten checked in to make sure things were progressing. </span><span class="s2">My <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> and the architect made themselves available to come to the apartment multiple times before I closed so we could discuss the best options for my space. They presented a range of design ideas that addressed my needs/wants and they were always clear and upfront about costs and time frame. </span></p>
<p>I lived in my apartment for about eight weeks before construction began which allowed me to learn a bit about the space before making final decisions. I saw the apartment in the summer, so I knew the potential of the strong, natural light that existed and which areas needed a boost. I could consider how I&#8217;d like to live in each section of the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22489 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan.jpg" alt="Kristen-Floorplan" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My main objective was to open up the kitchen. A wall between the kitchen and living room dampened all the light, while a second wall featured a window frame-type of cutout with an awkward shoulder-height countertop. By knocking down the walls, the kitchen would open up into the dining and living areas, allowing those spaces to flow more easily—from workspace to entertaining to relaxation. Additional overhead lighting would brighten up the space even more.</p>

<p>I cook often and my priority for the kitchen was to install a peninsula with large, deep drawers so I could easily store large pots and pans and not keep them in the oven! It would provide substantial work space, and allow for an easy transitional section for entertaining. While they probably seem like minor choices, I think sliding double drawers for utensils and a separate spice cabinet were<span style="color: #000000;"> a</span> good use of space so items are readily accessible. Lastly, my previous building didn&#8217;t allow for a dishwasher, so being able to have one was a massive step up and a life-changing purchase!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My overall vision for the space was a bright, crisp but serene environment. I have worked in commercial art galleries for the past 17 years, so the artwork I own is really what I want to be the focal point of every space. I wanted the surroundings to quietly complement the art on view, and I think the clean lines really set up a solid framework to showcase the things I love.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22467 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12" width="1000" height="1421" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-211x300.jpg 211w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-600x853.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22468 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-13.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-13" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Aesthetically, I wanted a modern, warm and clean kitchen that could serve as a neutral backdrop for any display of accessories, ceramics, or statement pieces. The previous cabinets were a wood color that dulled the natural light, and I chose instead a classic white shaker-style cabinet that worked nicely with the modern lines used elsewhere in the apartment. More functional than marble, the quartz countertop features traditional light gray veining that goes well with the gray variations of the flooring. Of all the choices to be made, I had the most difficult time finding a backsplash tile I liked; most were too clinical and slick or seemed dated. My Sweeten contractor brought me to a tile vendor for more options, and in the course showed me the material he had recently installed in his own full bath. Although he had used it as flooring, I really responded to the matte surface and the subtle geometric shape. Also on my wishlist was stainless steel appliances. I love that the oven is flush with the countertop with no back panel or raised display, enhancing the kitchen’s clean lines. I decided on brass hardware which doesn&#8217;t match the appliances, but the gold tones of the metal add another dimension without making things busy.</p>

<p>In addition to the kitchen, I wanted to upgrade the storage in the apartment. The interiors of some closets were refinished and cleaned up after years of use, while two bedroom closets were merged into one large one. The bathroom received an upgrade with a new sink, vanity and medicine cabinet. What makes me happiest is now there is a place for everything. In my old apartment, everything I owned had to serve several functions—the coffee table was also hidden storage, the closets were jammed with paperwork, clothing, cleaning products, and pantry items. My current apartment is so well organized; my beautiful bedroom closet makes me want to keep everything in its place.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge was patience. When you start a project like this, it can be very daunting if you have never done it before. I chose to live in the apartment while work was done, and while I wouldn&#8217;t change that decision, I think it took a toll. It was great to see the progress being made every day, but there are only so many nights you can be comfortable sleeping in plaster dust or having dinner behind a big plastic sheet. Doing construction in New York City has its trials—like getting to all the supply stores without a car. My Sweeten contractor and his crew doing the work on a daily basis were understanding and accommodating and that definitely lessened the stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I came into the renovation with many questions about timeframe and finances. I had heard horror stories about contractors abandoning jobs and I was fearful that I&#8217;d end up paying for an incomplete job. The members on my contractor’s team, however each were helpful in different ways. I really benefited from the experience and opinions of multiple people. The job wasn&#8217;t huge overall, but they treated me with respect, and knew this was a significant decision for me. They were all realistic about my options, pricing, and the pros/cons of different materials. It was challenging to keep everything straight, but anytime things went off course they were quickly corrected.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22481 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>On a more personal note, I was a bit nervous that I&#8217;d have a difficult time making so many decisions. There are infinite outlets for design and it&#8217;s easy to be overwhelmed even if you have a clear sense of your own style. Stay true to your goals and make decisions for your space that will benefit you every day. I learned that it pays off to do something bold even if it is small: the kitchen is neutral because it opens up into my living area, but the second bedroom didn’t face the same constraints. I painted it a dark green and love sitting in that space. In the end, I worried less about creating a showplace, and came away with a home that I am proud of and that suits me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Kristen, for sharing your beautiful home, and showing us how you use your space to surround yourself with the items you love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, I checked in with a few of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten&#8217;s</a> interior designers to see what&#8217;s taking shape in apartments across the City. I found simple and smart ideas that bring a fresh eye to any home. Below are a few spring-ready snapshots, highlighting some of my favorite themes:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8211; white basics and natural wood/green accents to freshen and organize a space<br />
&#8211; glass and lucite accessories as ways to lighten and brighten a space<br />
&#8211; mint and gold as new color update options</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Natural Accents and Easy Green Companions</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design accents inspired by nature can go a long way to satisfy our desire for fresh air and extra daylight. Sweeten Expert Jill took this five foot East Village kitchen and made it gorgeous and functional with a singular focus on white kitchen and storage basics, highlighted with natural accents using greens and wood grains. This is a great reminder that the form of everyday kitchen basics can be beautiful and that low-maintenance plants like succulents and philodendron are super stylish options for areas that need warmth and color.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Statements in Glass and Lucite</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m making an extra effort this year to appreciate the extended daylight hours that come with the season. Transparent materials like glass and lucite<span id="more-11206"></span> work in every room to amplify natural light, make a space feel more open, and provide function without a heavy visual effect. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3055">Sweeten Expert Michele</a> brought in a dining table that does double duty as both a substantial gathering spot and a weightless source of light in this Chelsea loft. The glass top plays up light throughout the room and draws attention to the neutral benches underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11211 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-02.jpeg" alt="interior-design-gold-glass" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-02.jpeg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-02-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3145">Sweeten Expert Danielle</a> added to the light, bright theme in this Woodside kitchen with glass and lucite lighting fixtures, decorative accents, and counter seats. Set against the natural palette of the cabinet and tile finishes, reflective surfaces around this kitchen lend a fresh, almost dewy, glow to this space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402">Sweeten Experts Anishka and Niya</a> used glass and lucite accents to keep this Brooklyn bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/park-slope-apartment-interior-makeover/">featured on the Sweeten blog last year</a>, ultra clean and simple. With white bedding and transparent accents, your eye is naturally drawn to the window and the plant, creating a natural and serene tone in this room. <em>(Photos: Niya Bascom Photography)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fresh Color Updates</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Brooklyn, Sweeten Expert Jill was first out of the gate with two color accents that have started to emerge everywhere I look. Jill paired this super-charged mint green bedside cabinet with warm natural tones in the headboard, and found simple, chic gold and glass accents that feel a little retro and a little modern on the desk.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Renovations can be painful. Sweeten takes the hassle and guesswork out of the process. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and we are thrilled with the end product.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Ben C., Brooklyn Heights homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you do when you realize that your bathroom is just not working for you anymore? Ben &amp; Therese&#8217;s Brooklyn Heights bathroom wasn&#8217;t even 10 years old before they recognized that the space was ugly, outdated, and felt cramped &#8212; even little Enzo (pictured above) didn&#8217;t want to bathe in what he regarded as a cheap, generic tub &#8212; it was time for an update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a savvy approach, collecting enough inspiration and research online that, together, they were ultimately able to design the bathroom of their dreams and a space that would reflect their personal tastes. They even built a 3D model of their ideas using Google SketchUp to help them plan and visualize the space; according to Ben, &#8220;we didn’t want to leave anything to chance, and we wanted to make sure we utilized every square inch as best we could.&#8221; With their very real vision, Ben &amp; Therese were more than ready to renovate, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to be matched with a vetted general contractor who would help them finish the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10793" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="475" height="462" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png 594w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02-300x292.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben &amp; Therese moved forward with their first match who was just the right fit for the project, and in just 4 weeks, Sweeten Expert Aleks and his team were able transform the generic bath into the homeowners&#8217; inspired vision. Here&#8217;s their space before &amp; after:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10794 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a universal ideal of clean, simple and modern, but made a space that is uniquely theirs by incorporating industrial elements like cement tile &amp; shower doors on sliding hardware, and adding a splash of color with Moroccan-inspired flooring tiles. Ben even says that it feels bigger and more open after renovating (a big plus in BK), not to mention that it&#8217;s much more functional. I love it, they love it, their friends love it, and little Enzo couldn&#8217;t be happier &#8212; sounds like a win!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great work to Aleks &amp; his team &#8212; and big congrats and many thanks to Ben, Therese &amp; Enzo!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the end of last year, Elliot, a Graphic Designer, and Katie, a Benefit Specialist, decided that the time had come to take the scary but sensible plunge and become first-time homeowners of an older 1,800 sq/ft, 2-story townhouse in Williamsburg. The couple fell in love with this house&#8217;s lovely bones, plus it had a backyard for their dog, Desmond; but what they did not love was that it had the common NYC problem of disjointed spaces caused by a layout of many smaller rooms, not to mention the interior&#8217;s outdated <em><span style="color: #000000;">everything</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the couple had never done a renovation before, they were excited by the idea of fixing up an older home. So the next task was to find their general contractor, which wouldn&#8217;t be easy (they thought) since they didn&#8217;t know many other homeowners, and therefore word-of-mouth was out of the question. After hearing about our resources at Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie &amp; Elliot posted their project</a> right away to get matched with members of the Sweeten Network. After comparing their matches, the young homeowners chose to put their project in the trustworthy hands of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a> focused on sustainable design-building. The contractor worked with the renovation newbies to think through everything from the practicality of materials to overall design concepts, before beginning construction on their 4-month project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10650 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10651 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10652 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Katie &amp; Elliot&#8217;s first order of business was to re-do the kitchen so that they could finally enjoy eating-in, as much as they do dining out at their favorite neighborhood spot. Ecostruct enlarged the space by opening up existing entranceways and creating larger floor-to-ceiling cabinet systems. During demolition, Ecostruct&#8217;s team, lead by Jon Eklund, found that the existing plumbing needed to be replaced because it was not up to code (and was actually a ticking time bomb inside their walls). This added some extra time, expenses, and maybe a few gray hairs to the project, but both the homeowners and Jon&#8217;s team were confident that it was a problem worth solving right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10653 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10654 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10655 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily, Elliot and Katie have similar taste when it comes to interiors. The couple wanted to create a home that had a warm, clean and modern feel with plenty of light. For the kitchen, they choose to use both recessed lighting and Caravaggio Matte Grey Pendant Lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10656 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jon helped Elliot and Katie think about the new materials in terms of cost, aesthetics and sustainability &#8211; triple bonus! The couple picked Caesarstone in White Farina for their countertops which is known not just for its simplified fabrication and installation process that makes it budget-friendly, but also for its nonporous and scratch resistant qualities which will help it retain a perfect surface without sealants or waxes, keeping harmful toxins out of the home. For the floors, the couple went with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the living room, open kitchen and dining room. The wood adds nice warmth to the space and its natural irregularities make a nice contrast with the white clean lines of their kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10657 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10658 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it was the mix of mid-90’s earth toned floor-to-ceiling tiles, black accented toilet seat, or the fact that the faulty old pipes in the walls were about to bust open, updating this bathroom was a must. I loved how, by continuing with the same color palette and general clean aesthetic of the adjacent kitchen, the bathroom  now reads as an integrated part of the home and less of a time warp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10659 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The living room is tied both aesthetically and visually by opening up the island and updating the dry bar so the ever so hospitable Katie or Elliot can do what they do best, serve their lucky guests a cocktail while cooking up a meal in the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10666 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the entry foyer, the homeowners had Jon&#8217;s team replace the front door and repaint the concrete flooring and wood staircase; they also hung a nice big <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/park-slope-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror that looks pretty familiar</a>. I really like the shabby-chic but very gender-neutral vibe of the foyer, which I&#8217;m sure is making many great first impressions for the Katie and Elliot&#8217;s visiting friends and family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks and congrats to Katie and Elliot! And a big thanks to Jon and his team at Ecostruct!</p>

<p>This week we&#8217;re back in the West Village to check out a Sweeten member&#8217;s newest completed project. After almost 30 years in their 1,000 sqft flat, homeowners Ron &amp; Suzen were excited to give their space a full gut renovation which began early last summer. The home&#8217;s new 1-bed, 2-bath layout is a complete reworking of the former 2-bed, 1-bath arrangement; and a uniquely designed (<a href="/2012/10/11/site-visit-gut-modernization-of-west-village-home-first-look/#more-5425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and precisely built</a>) open kitchen takes center stage, making it the perfect space to cook and host friends &amp; family. When we stopped by, Peter Maslow and photographer Cary Whittier (<a href="https://carywhittier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carywhittier.com/</a>) were on site as well, snapping some final shots of the completed project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Spring is in the air &#8212; a time for the fresh and the new! So, with Spring in mind, we have a fresh renovation from one of Sweeten&#8217;s newest members. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Design + Build</a> is a full-concept, design-to-execution firm based in Manhattan. Last year, Essential finished up a full restoration &amp; renovation of this 3,960 sqft single-family home in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens. The home was originally built in the 1920&#8217;s and hadn&#8217;t been updated since 1970 before its new owners brought in the team at Essential. The firm&#8217;s president, Rich Hiler, and architectural designer, Alison Lang, gave us the full details of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/portfolios/Gut-Renovation/Forest-Hills-Gardens-Summer-Street-Home-Forest-Hills-Garden-NY/575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer St. home renovation</a>; here are some of our favorite highlights of the finished project.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-7882 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg" alt="home renovation forest hills queens" width="723" height="578" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />The renovated home is abundant with traditional elements such as built-ins, window seats, and crown moldings, but a modern palette of fixtures, furnishings, color &amp; pattern give the space a distinctly 21st century feel (&#8211;it didn&#8217;t surprise us to learn that the homeowner is actually an interior designer!). Here in the family room, monochromatic walls in Benjamin Moore hue <a href="https://store.benjaminmoore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black pepper</a> are a neutral base for an eclectic mix of furnishings &amp; fixtures. Among our favorites are a pair of <a href="https://www.lumens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artemide&#8217;s miconos sconces</a> at the window seat, and a round marble-top table by <a href="https://www.draenert.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draenert</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-7880"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-7883 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/02_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg" alt="home renovation forest hills queens" width="723" height="904" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/02_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/02_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />The home&#8217;s new design was intended to maintain the integrity of its original 1920&#8217;s arts &amp; crafts interior, while also updating the architecture to be more open &amp; modern. Looking at this opening to the kitchen, subtle differences in the detailing indicate where the traditional and modern elements meet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-7884 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg" alt="home renovation forest hills queens" width="723" height="904" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> We love the new kitchen &#8212; the design here was inspired in part by a photo the homeowner provided of Julia Child&#8217;s Boston kitchen. Without becoming a literal translation of the image, the inspiration lead to a slightly 1970&#8217;s vibe in the very modern space. The monochromatic scheme in the adjacent family room also continues into the custom kitchen. Other highlights are the David Hicks wallpapered ceiling (a nod to the homeowner&#8217;s living room rug by the same designer) and the <a href="https://hivemodern.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topan vp6 pendant lamps by &amp;tradition</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-7887 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/06_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg" alt="home renovation forest hills queens" width="723" height="578" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/06_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/06_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> Upstairs, Essential built a sitting area and dressing room that compliment the master bedroom&#8217;s sleeping quarters. The dressing room is outfitted in full with beautifully designed &amp; executed, custom built-ins.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-7888 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/07_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg" alt="home renovation forest hills queens" width="723" height="904" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/07_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/07_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> Like the detailing downstairs, the built-ins showcase a modern play on traditional design &amp; craft.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-7889 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/08_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg" alt="home renovation forest hills queens" width="723" height="578" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/08_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/08_theSweeten_essentialDesign+Build-summerSt-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />In the master bathroom, the flooring is a traditional <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white penny tile</a> with black penny tile accent. Walls are tiled in Saarinen-inspired <a href="https://www.waterworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echo tile from Waterworks</a> in &#8216;clear day&#8217; with black accents. The project architect, Daniel Flebut, custom designed the vanity with <a href="https://www.silestoneusa.com/colors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8216;white zeus extreme&#8217; countertops</a>, as well as the flush, mirrored medicine cabinets.</p>
