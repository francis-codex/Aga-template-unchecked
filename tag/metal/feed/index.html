<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Chenta had been looking for a new place for about six months when they visited a duplex apartment in the former home of the Ridgewood Times, a local newspaper of record in the area. They fell in love with the space and saw a lot of potential in it. The creatives—Michael designs sweaters and Chenta is a director in web design—were drawn to a warm but minimalist look, and knew immediately how they could alter the apartment to achieve their desired surroundings. The prewar industrial building was situated in Ridgewood, Queens, right on the border of Brooklyn, and dated back to 1932. It also briefly housed a school, and then was converted to condos in 2009. The structure&#8217;s original industrial elements, including steel beams and wood materials, concrete floors, high ceilings, and great expanses of windows, were preserved in the conversion. The space was everything that Michael and Chenta were looking for, with an interesting history to boot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While they were in contract on the property, Michael and Chenta began reaching out to general contractors independently, but felt overwhelmed. They would call contractors and hear nothing back. Michael then <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/12757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project</a> to Sweeten’s site, explaining they wanted to reveal the concrete floors under beaten-up hardwood planks, and to create a new closet system for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master suite</a>. The couple was matched with several experts, and ultimately decided on their Sweeten general contractor. The contractor and her team worked with the duo to achieve the right combination of concrete, wood, metal, and paint colors to produce what Michael called a “modern Scandi style, but without the Boho elements.” They wanted “clean and simple lines, but we&#8217;re also trying to not make it look too cold or sterile.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25192 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg" alt="before" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25181 mb-0 size-full" title="living room and kitchen with concrete floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg" alt="concrete floors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of the biggest changes, the contractor’s team first ripped up the wood flooring to expose the concrete floors underneath on both levels of the duplex. They next applied an Italian product called Wall2Floor, a concrete-based mineral coating that had to be applied by hand to the existing substrate. The application creates a seamless surface and is usually used in luxury spaces. It gave the apartment floor a polished, sleek texture and paired nicely with the wooden banister and kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the streamlined effect, Michael and Chenta asked their Sweeten contractor to remove baseboard moldings and door frames. This accentuated the gallery-like feel of the loft space: walls were floated—meaning that the drywall stops short of the floor, and is not covered with base moldings, and when closed, doors were completely flush with the walls that surrounded them. Their choices of warm white paint in the living area and dusty pink in the living room provided a warm contrast against wood, metal, and concrete.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the master suite, they made layout changes to accommodate a walk-through (rather than walk-in) closet. The existing closets on the left wall were demolished, and a floating wall was created to section off the closet area without closing it completely. “It’s all very open with a lot of natural light,” Michael explained. New custom closets were designed with metal framed interiors and floor-to-ceiling oak doors and placed to face the new wall. They also opted to paint the walls inside the closets dark gray for more depth. All the hardware was finished in a matte black. “We didn’t like any of the standard finishes, so our contractor made the changes to help us achieve the clean lines and simplicity that we were looking for,” said Michael.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25189 mb-0 size-full" title="concrete floors and stairwell" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg" alt="concrete floors" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Michael and Chenta worked with their Sweeten team to ensure that each step was smooth. But like many renovations, there were some hiccups: they had to move in before the renovation was finished since they didn’t want to continue paying rent when they had started paying their mortgage. They waited until the concrete floors were finished (and protected with a plastic sheet), and then <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lived through the rest of the work</a>. “All our moving boxes were stacked in the middle of the living room, and we were sleeping on an airbed in a construction site,” describes Michael. Despite this, the couple felt that their contractor “was great from the beginning. She understood our vision and always had great ideas. She was the kindest person and talked us thoroughly through the process, even when Chenta and I had meltdowns.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael’s advice to would-be renovators? “Stay calm and put some money aside. It will work out in the end, but you will be over budget. It was a system that we weren’t familiar with, and although I understand how to create a product, I didn’t realize just how complex it would be to renovate an apartment. It takes so many steps to even properly <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paint</a> a wall! And all these little things need to be done to create a great end result, although they seem unnecessary when you are not familiar with the process.”</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Michael, Chenta, and their cat Taiger for sharing their showcase apartment with us!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RESOURCES. Concrete floors: <a href="http://www.novacolor.it/ita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall2Floor</a>. Oak closet doors: custom.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;<br />
