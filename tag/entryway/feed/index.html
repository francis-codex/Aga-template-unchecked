<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Landing a historic fixer-upper in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Our apartment, which we bought in 2019, is in a historic greystone building in Chicago’s Lakeview East neighborhood. A three-bedroom fixer-upper, we chose it knowing we could renovate it to our exact specifications. The unit had, curiously, two front doors, neither of which was in a logical location, and we wanted to find a solution to that problem. We needed to renovate the two <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>, which had been largely untouched for decades. And finally, we wanted to redo the living-room fireplace façade as a finishing touch to our renovation.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg" alt="Living area with window alcove and fireplace" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The apartment is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-floor unit</a> in a three-flat building; it’s around 1,575 square feet and has a 160-square-foot rear deck. We have two French bulldogs and wanted the condominium for its generous size, but we also appreciated its historic status and original character. We’d noticed that historic properties often had their period aspects stripped out. We wanted to bring modern updates to the space, maintain its vintage features, and incorporate mid-century touches into our design.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We’d recently completed a challenging remodel of the condominium’s kitchen, and felt we needed a new contractor to tackle the next phase. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, fielded responses, and soon found a contractor we believed was well-matched to the job.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Solving an odd problem: two front doors</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Moving our home’s entrance door was perhaps the change that required the most thought. Originally, the apartment had two front doors! One went into the living room, and the other opened into the smallest of our three bedrooms, which we think was the housekeeper’s room at some point. Door No. 1 limited the wall space in our relaxing and entertaining room. Door No. 2 made that tiny bedroom even smaller and less functional. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Entryway leading into the dining area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s8"></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">Initially, we’d decided to make the door to the small bedroom our primary front door, converting that room to a foyer. We’d tear out the door leading to the living room and drywall over it. This approach would have required only a slight expansion of the width of that door opening to the bedroom, and replacing trim in a couple of spots. But in the end, we decided the quick fix wasn’t the best option.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s8">Remodeling a new apartment entry</span></h3>
<p>After discussing it with our Sweeten contractor, we decided on a plan to create yet a third door. We would close off the two original entry doors and move the apartment’s front door to a new location in the dining room. These changes would give us full walls in both rooms. Closing Door No. 1 ultimately allowed for a friendlier, more functional furniture arrangement in the living room. Eliminating Door No. 2 created space for us to install a large storage system comprising a Murphy bed and a desk in the former housekeeper’s room. Two absolute wins.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Bed.gif" alt="Gif of the murphy bed closing and transforming into a desk" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52415" /></span></h3>
<p><span class="s8">Now our apartment needed an entirely new entry. For the new opening, we chose a modern front door that contrasts with the vintage character of the dining and living rooms within. We’re particularly happy about the contrast between “new and old” as you enter our home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Two black-and-white bathroom upgrades</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s9">Next, we moved on to updating the two </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">small </span><span class="s9">bathrooms</span></a><span class="s8">. We wanted to update the plumbing, tiling, and fixtures, plus add exhaust fans to both baths. We planned to source and provide all fixtures, including a bathtub, faucets, lighting, fans, and more. To stay on budget, we asked our contractor to provide only the rough materials and labor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white tiles, black tiled floor, and glass paneled shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52412" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span class="s8">&#8220;We found Sweeten’s detailed contractor reviews helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Aiming for a clean aesthetic consistent with our just-completed kitchen, we chose to tile every wall surface from <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/white-subway-tile-bathroom-7-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor to ceiling with white subway tile</a>. We’re pleased with the way this brings attention to our 10-foot ceilings. We chose similarly timeless black marble hex tile for the floors, hoping it would conceal dirt, hair, and other buildups between regular cleanings. Finally, we indulged our love of mid-century furniture, integrating matching bathroom vanities of that era’s style.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and matte black fixtures" width="1000" height="664" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52411" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and small wooden vanity" width="1000" height="1555" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-193x300.jpg 193w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-579x900.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s8">Achieving a sleek subway tile fireplace</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">The last idea we wanted to implement was in the living room, where we’d decided to add decorative subway tile around the original fireplace. When we purchased the apartment, the walls around the firebox were drywalled; </span><span class="s9">we wanted to reclaim the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace’s role as a focal point</a> for the living space. We chose a glossy white subway tile for the new fireplace façade to brighten the space. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">The key to finding the right general contractor in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Everything went remarkably smooth with the string of projects. Our Sweeten contractor was professional and provided clear <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advice on issues big and small</a>, including the placement of fixtures, the color of the grout, and more. We leaned heavily on our contractor’s expertise. We experienced no real challenges—this was in contrast to our experience during other phases of our broader renovation, with different contractors. We’ve renovated before, and we know: The wrong contractor can add unnecessary stress, delays, and cost. The right contractor can make the process relatively painless.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg" alt="White tiled fireplace with decorative clock above" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52408" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg" alt="Exterior of the home in Chicago" width="1000" height="1472" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52413" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-204x300.jpg 204w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-600x883.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8">We found Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovators-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed contractor reviews</a> helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire. We appreciated the additional insurance—and assurance—Sweeten provided. The right resources helped us to mostly <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay on budget</a>, too. We had no major cost overruns. A few of our fixtures arrived damaged, but we were able to quickly source replacements and stay on schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The end result has made us very happy. We’re satisfied with our design choices, and the way our contractor’s work and craftsmanship aligned with our vision. It’s all about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding the right partner</a> for the project.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A ranch-style Georgia home with appeal</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We bought this 1958 home in Atlanta’s Buckhead section with plans to renovate right away. Nothing was wrong, per se, but we knew we wanted to remodel. The plan was to improve the layout and exterior façade and update the kitchen and bathrooms. A big project would also turn the primary bedroom into a true master suite.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are Jenna and Hagan, now parents to two daughters: Clay, 2, and Sloan, 7 months. Henry, our dog, lives here, too. When we found the house, we were still expecting our second child and I was working from home due to the pandemic. More space and some rooms to relax in were all we could think about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A mid-century remodel focused on good bones with potential</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our ranch-style home, in the Chastain Park neighborhood, comprises 3,000 square feet. It has a backyard with mature trees, and the house benefits from pretty views and lots of natural light. The interior was traditionally styled, and we liked it. We felt, however, that we could make it work better for our family, and set out to do that. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and the team quickly sourced four quality contractors for us to consider. We soon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6751#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a general contractor</a> who inspired our confidence. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We brought floorplans to our meetings, as layout changes were the most challenging part of the project. Our house had a lot of storage space that we saw a potential to put to better use. These would include the bedroom areas as well as more useful spaces for the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the den, our contractor removed a large built-in shelf that had started to separate from the wall. We also painted this room and stained the floor dark brown.</span></p>

<span class="s1">&#8220;The contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A new bay window brightens the kitchen</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The plan for the kitchen included putting in a bay window in the existing breakfast nook and installing Dolomite marble countertops. We ordered a new kitchen sink and added a subway tile backsplash. We kept the existing cabinets, switching out the knobs for a fast refresh. To increase function in this section of the house, we turned to old closets. Opening up the boxed-in space of the four lining the back hallway made space for a butler’s pantry with a second fridge. We also built a laundry room in this area in a follow-up to the larger renovation. </span></p>

<h3>Transforming closets for a master suite</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the back of the house, closets (again) and one of the offices gave their square footage to enlarge our master suite and another bedroom. For the master suite, we imagined a large, open bedroom area looking out into the backyard. We would also add a walk-in closet, a big bathroom, and a powder room. The remap worked brilliantly. An existing door was repurposed as a sliding barn door and leads to our master walk-in closet. The contractor built a secret door at its back that lets us quickly get to the kids’ bedrooms during the night. It has come in handy!</span></p>

<h3 class="p4">Three bathrooms with new tile</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations came next. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-save-on-home-remodeling-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We did them economically</a>—as in almost simultaneously. Each bath got new tile, though we retained usable fixtures and hardware</span><span class="s1"> where we could. At one point, we had three bathrooms torn up. The one in use had a shower only, and our two-year-old was terrified of showers! We were pleased when the child’s bathroom, replete with new tub and penny tile floor, was finished—not to mention the other three. Our beautiful master bath, with a freestanding fluted bathtub, a glass-walled shower, and double sinks got the full marble treatment. The color palette was a mix of gray and white, including sleek large-sheet floor tiles</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Whole-house improvements for curb appeal</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Much of the house had hardwood flooring in need of refinishing. From the bedrooms to the living room, den, foyer, and kitchen, the contractors sanded and stained them. In another global redo, the contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows. The new kitchen bay window </span><span class="s1">looks great from the inside and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhances the home’s curb appeal</a>. The house would also get a new coat of exterior paint. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A Sweeten general contractor to count on</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through it all, our Sweeten contractor was reliable and competent. He was diligent with the permitting process, a delay-ridden challenge during Covid. (Key takeaway: Be 100 percent sure you need a permit and factor it into your timeline!) Our contractor was transparent on costs, and his efforts resulted in a pleasing final product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s been a feat, but finally, we feel settled. Jenna and I waited so long for our master suite—it feels magical to have our own space. The girls, and Henry the dog, are happy. We are home.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Monique</span></i></p>
<h3>Moving from co-op to a house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After living in Brooklyn for nine years, I decided to move back to Queens in search of more space and a slice of the outdoors. I purchased a 1,300-square-foot attached brick rowhouse from the ‘40s. It had a small front patio where I could sit and drink my coffee on the weekends, plus a small front garden to plant vegetables and do some xeriscaping (landscaping that requires little or no irrigation).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="happy-homeowner-dining-area" class="alignnone wp-image-50383 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2.jpg" alt="happy homeowner in the dining area with white round table after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50364 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Image of the exterior of a brick Queens rowhouse" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the purpose of the purchase and subsequent renovation was to create a sanctuary where I could relax after a long day of work. I wanted to make sure to bring in the things that I had loved about my Brooklyn brownstone co-op, while enjoying and making good use of my new space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always wanted to live in a Craftsman cottage but knew I couldn’t find this style of building in New York City. Instead, I decided I would incorporate cottage-style elements into my interior design choices. A few things would need to be changed immediately; there were lime green walls in the bedroom and a vibrant orange hallway. I also wanted to rip up the linoleum and carpet floors, replace the house’s original windows, and update the kitchen, bathroom, and entryway.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3>Spicing up the entry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entryway </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was very important to me. Moving from an apartment to a house, I could now fully set the tone that welcomed everyone into my home. The entryway had been functional, but bland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="patterned-tiles-entryway" class="alignnone wp-image-50365 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg" alt="patterned tiles at entryway with two wooden doors after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-wallpaper-entryway-blue-door" class="alignnone wp-image-50406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg" alt="white wallpaper in entryway with blue door and blue patterend floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I added some touches that brought the outside in and made me smile whenever I opened the front door. I chose to custom design the steel front door in a Craftsman style that felt warm and inviting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the flooring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, white-and-blue handmade cement tiles added a lot of personality. I didn’t want the walls to pale in comparison to the bold floor, so I found a textured and paintable wallpaper that mimicked an abstracted cloud design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-room-separator-brown-floor-tile" class="alignnone wp-image-50368 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1.jpg" alt="white room separator with passageway to room on one side and the living room on another with brown floor tile after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="wooden-flooring-white-living-room" class="alignnone wp-image-50367 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1.jpg" alt="wooden flooring in white living room with blue couch after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t have enough space for a grand entrance, I still wanted to make a statement for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">front entry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using a modern fixture and opening up the arch to double the size in the living room.</span></p>
<h3>Design elements to make it truly home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized how important incorporating the outdoors into the space was for me. When I was a kid, we couldn’t really afford to renovate the wood-paneled walls that were in my bedroom. Instead, my mom gave my room a woodland theme and installed green carpet that was the color of grass and would encourage me to take off my socks so we could play barefoot in the “grass” together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-room-black-couch-wooden-floor" class="alignnone wp-image-50369 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg" alt="white room with black couch and white pendant light and wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-blue-couch" class="alignnone wp-image-50372 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg" alt="white living room with blue and red couch and white floor rug on wooden floor and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so excited when my Sweeten general contractor suggested I install European tilt-and-turn-style windows. You can open them all the way and really feel like you are inviting in the outdoors. We were able to remove the linoleum and carpet throughout the house and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stain the wood floors</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underneath. I debated going with a modern, gray stain, but ultimately decided on a timeless walnut that felt more appropriate to the cottage style. I loved the original </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built-in shelves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the living room, so I just asked for the design elements at the top to be cut off, which made the built-ins feel timeless versus dated.</span></p>

<h3>Form and function for a Cottage-style kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I decided to mix cooler colors and neutrals like blues, whites, and grays, balanced with a bit of warmth from some champagne bronze accents. I wanted a certain set of cabinet pulls that were too expensive for my budget, but was thrilled to find a similar version for a third of the price.</span></p>
<h3>Small kitchen details made the difference</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was these kinds of details that really started to matter to me throughout the process. I spent hours looking at doorknobs and faucets, which I hadn’t expected. I didn’t realize how much I would want a say in every design choice and how much I would care about all the little details that were going into my home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-closed-cabinets" class="alignnone wp-image-50379 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1.jpg" alt="white open kitchen with closed kitchen cabinets and golden handles and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-granite-counter" class="alignnone wp-image-50413 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-22.gif" alt="white kitchen cabinets and granite countertop and white backsplash in a wooden floored kitchen towards passageway after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="breakfast-nook-round-table" class="alignnone wp-image-50378 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2.jpg" alt="breakfast nook with round white table and chairs and a bench on wooden floor and white pendant light on top and large window with white sheer curtain after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I have room to eat in the kitchen. My contractor transformed a small broom closet in the hallway into a pull-out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pantry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It stores all of my dry goods and is so space-efficient. Without it, that closet would have held trash bags and a Swiffer, but now I use every inch of that space for my spices, peanut butter, and pancake mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One small accent that was a big deal for me was the ceramic crackle push plates for the swinging doors between the kitchen and the bedroom. I’m a big fan of British television and had been inspired by the homes in shows I watch. It was hard to find this kind of push plate in the U.S., so I ended up having them imported from England. I was so nervous about them making it over in one piece, but they did, and I’m so glad I was able to incorporate them into my space. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of my decisions were functional, but everyone thought I was crazy when I installed wainscoting in my very tight </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">powder room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I understand why—the wainscoting literally took away space—but I went for it anyway. As a trade-off, I saved space with a corner toilet and a size-appropriate sink. I am really happy with how it turned out.</span></p>
<h3>Remodeling with peace-of-mind</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t really need to take up Sweeten’s check-ins during the renovation. It was reassuring, though, to know they were there should issues come up, as this was my first major home renovation. It gave me peace of mind—like that optional purchase protection on a big product purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, I wasn’t sure how long everything would take or how involved I would be in the process. I was glad that I was able to be involved in most of the decisions, even though I <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work full-time and couldn’t be physically</a> present all day. I don’t know how working people managed projects like this before email!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My renovated space feels like a peaceful retreat. I love how welcoming and warm it feels for my friends and their kids to come and hang out. My contractor understood my vision and now I’m able to relax and fully be myself in this new space.</span></p>

<h2>No space? No problem! Get inspired by these small entryway ideas by Sweeten</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: the entryway is the first space—and the last—everyone sees in your home. It&#8217;s a perfect space for making a statement, and it deserves a careful balance of form and function. Regardless of your usable square footage, there are great options for style and utility improvements in even the smallest of entryways. Here, we highlight 5 design-forward small entryway ideas by Sweeten contractors.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 1: Enlarge a small entryway area</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39880" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For an 1,800-square-foot apartment in Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side, a couple hired architect Jessica Wetters to help reimagine the space. It was a full-gut renovation of the kitchen, master bedroom, living area, and bathroom, as well as <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/"><span class="s2">the entry area.</span></a> The entry was a relatively simple job, since they were gutting the rest of the house, but it brought outsized benefits: a great first impression, an enlarged space to fit a comfortable bench, and a floating shelf for essentials.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Laura and Randy put an offer on their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/"><span class="s2">Upper East Side co-op</span></a>, they envisioned an all-new, more functional layout. Central to the plan was the small entryway. &#8220;We knew we wanted to extend the entryway as it was incredibly narrow with two closets on either side of the front door,&#8221; Laura said. &#8220;We decided to keep the larger walk-in and remove the smaller one, to create a place that was pretty but also functional.&#8221; The couple completed the statement with stunning, geometric-patterned wallpaper</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 2: Use wallpaper to make a statement</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43738" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg" alt="wallpaper foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jessica and Alex had rented for six years before buying an <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/"><span class="s2">800-square-foot co-op</span></a> in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Although they were thrilled to finally own a home, they knew the apartment would need work before feeling like their home. They remodeled the galley kitchen and the bathroom and reconfigured a few closets. They also gave the entryway some attention, with carefully chosen wallpaper to make a visual statement. &#8220;The subtle raffia gives texture and depth to the walls,&#8221; said Jessica. &#8220;We chose materials that would stand the test of time from both an aesthetic and durability standpoint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For media executive Jenifer Herrmann and her partner Mitzie Wong (co-founder of creative design firm <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/"><span class="s2">Roar + Rabbit),</span></a> wallpaper was likewise the way to make a statement in their newly renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/"><span class="s2">entryway.</span></a> They added Rhye wallpaper in hand foil and completed the look with a round mirror from <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com/"><span class="s2">Serena &amp; Lily </span></a>and a console from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/"><span class="s2">West Elm—</span></a>elements that complemented their nature theme.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 3: Combine function + design accents</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41693" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40969" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tina, a designer, and her husband Andrew wished they had entryway storage for shoes and coats. When they planned a complete renovation of their  <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/"><span class="s2">1930s co-op</span></a> in Sunnyside, New York, they had to contend with tight space constraints in the entryway. Since they couldn&#8217;t enlarge the space, they used their imaginations to maximize the space, combining form with function. They added a small bench, along with hooks for bags and coats, all set against a shiplap background. &#8220;We love the clean lines and texture of details of the shiplap,&#8221; said Tina.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Erin and Chris, their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/"><span class="s2">three-bedroom, two-bath co-op</span></a> in a post-war, 1950s building also lacked storage at the entry. To remedy, they installed a bench with storage bins underneath and overhead. For finishing touches they added wicker baskets, a floating shelf, and a metal-framed mirror to the adjacent wall</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 4: Add a statement piece</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After renting for many years, John wanted to start building equity. He bought a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/murray-hill-full-apartment-renovation/"><span class="s2">1,200-square-foot apartment</span></a> on Park Avenue in New York City, with gorgeous views of the skyline. He enlisted architect <a href="https://aurorafarewell.com/"><span class="s2">Aurora Farewell</span></a> to help improve the layout and add professional touches, to make the space feel cohesive and thoughtfully designed. For the entryway, he wanted a sense of drama. He and the architect chose a large round mirror to cover most of the wall, above a minimalistic, multifunction wood bench</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 5: Make the entryway space do double duty</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/">Chris and Jeremy</a></span><span class="s2"> had hoped to renovate sometime in the distant future. Then, water damage from a leaky apartment above required immediate attention, inspiring them to go beyond repairs and jump into a larger renovation. In addition to the bathroom, they remodeled their kitchen and living areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They also knew the foyer presented an interesting opportunity. It was large enough to feel like wasted spaces if they left it empty, but too small for any obvious uses. Their Sweeten general contractor helped them find an imaginative solution. &#8220;We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8-inches deep. It holds loads more than we expected,&#8221; said Jeremy. &#8220;On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar.&#8221; Art lights hang over tall mirrors, giving a classic gallery sensibility</span>.</p>

<h3>Lightening the mood</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I could have done a lot worse than this hand-me-down—a West Village apartment that my mom and dad purchased in 2016. My sister, Lindsay, lived in the studio for a couple of years until she moved in with her boyfriend in Brooklyn. I’d gotten my career in fundraising events off the ground, and I decided to leave my roommates in Murray Hill and move in.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg" alt="white family room with large picture window and white brick fireplace and tray ceiling with recessed lighting after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The apartment is in a co-op building that was built in 1915. It’s small—approximately 320 square feet—and had accumulated some </span><span class="s5">questionable design touches from long ago</span><span class="s1">. Paneled walls, painted in a pretty but dark shade of teal, and distressed wood trim gave the place a downbeat vibe. It was so dark that I had at times referred to it as “The Dungeon.” Brightening the space was my priority.</span></p>

<h3>Choosing materials for resale in the future</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovating the studio apartment</a> was a family project, planned with my </span><span class="s1">mom, Reneé, and my dad, John. This was our first renovation in New York City and we were nervous. We didn’t know where to find a contractor or what standard pricing would be. Where to start? To add to the challenge, we decided to keep the budget down by not hiring a designer. I would make most of the design decisions myself. We started by posting our project to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46932" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s best to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know the process and design plan</a> before you start a project. I wanted it to feel light, warm, cozy, and fun. It also felt important to create a home that would appeal to future buyers. As much as I love this place, it’s a studio—it likely won’t be my “forever home.” So I tried to pick materials that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the kitchen current and timeless</a> and the bathroom neutral. I created a document with inspiration photos and a materials list for each room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared it with our Manhattan contractor</a> as soon as we offered him the job.</span></p>

<span class="s1">&#8220;Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful sourcing the products I wanted.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My family and I agreed we would tear out the ugly paneling in hopes of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up the studio&#8217;s main living</a> and sleeping space; white walls and recessed lighting would brighten the space. Meanwhile, painting the window in charcoal frames the natural light coming in. </span><span class="s1">Next up was the kitchen, which had newish appliances, but needed most everything else, from repainting the cabinets to new floor tile, countertops, and backsplash. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh the bathroom</a>, we would paint, replace wall and floor tiles, update the shower, and add a new vanity, mirror, and lighting fixtures.</span></p>
<h3>Discovering hidden arches</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">We were excited when our general contractor got started at the beginning of March 2020. During demolition, we found the arched doorways inside the apartment. We’d had no idea about these beautiful, curved pass-throughs—they’d been covered up with drywall and paneling. It was great to find a bit of the apartment’s original charm still intact. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46937 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To modernize, we focused on lighting and thought about storage (a vanity with storage and a wall-mounted shoe rack)—vital aspects of the project in this tiny space. </span><span class="s1">I gave a lot of thought to creating a mix of open and closed storage. All the pretty stuff goes on the open shelving, and everything unsightly or rarely used has a spot to hide in.</span></p>
<h3>Renovating during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Once we’d started working, the biggest challenge we had was dealing with COVID-19. A couple of weeks after our demolition phase, New York City shut down. Our Sweeten contractor was helpful in dealing with all the new health-related laws, as well as our co-op’s rules. As the pandemic escalated, only a few workers were allowed on-site, staying distanced; toward the end, it was only one worker at a time.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46928" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46929" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I ended up leaving Manhattan to quarantine at my family’s home, and as the situation worsened, most design choices had to be discussed over text, email, or FaceTime. Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourcing the products</a> I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After a last-minute decision to change the floors, within a few hours, I found floor samples, ordered them for curbside pickup, chose, and ordered the boards so our contracting team could pick them up at an NYC location. Our contractor installed them the next day. It was stressful, but I love what we ended up with!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="West Village bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46930" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The challenges of the pandemic pushed our timeline from two months to three, but we didn’t care—we wanted the work to be done safely. Our contractor was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diligent in our communication</a> emailing us progress photos every week and scheduling FaceTime walkthroughs. He notified our building’s management company and us if loud work was planned so that neighbors could be warned. This was especially important since everyone was working from home!</span></p>
<h3>Reno tips from the homeowner</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Even in these lean and uncertain times, my advice is to add a buffer to the budget—there is always a surprise, or a little project, to add. I love the creative side, picking out materials, and deciding what worked best together. We certainly did not <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs under our budget</a>. Not even close! We ended up spending about $70,000 on this project.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the end, thanks to my family, luck, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding our Sweeten contractor</a>, I’m immensely happy! It’s so comforting to come home. I wanted to modernize the apartment, brighten it, and bring it into this decade—and that’s precisely what we did.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you for sharing your West Village co-op renovation with us, Taylor! We love how your 320-square-foot space turned out.</i></span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<p>Nine years seems like a long time, but some things are worth the wait. That’s the case for Barbra, a television producer, and Sean, who purchased their 1,100-square-foot Kensington, Brooklyn, prewar co-op and only recently renovated. They were used to kitchen cabinets too shallow for dinner plates, broken track lighting, and crumbling baseboards. Despite it all, the couple, along with their sons Jack, 11, and Clint, 8, are glad they lived in the space and really understood what they wanted and needed before remodeling. It made it easier when they posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Kensington co-op renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>, who they say was open to their ideas, gave them great tips on where (and where not) to splurge, and helped them stay within budget.</p>
<p>The apartment had a lot of light and great bones, but it was dated and needed a complete overhaul. A slapdash remodel in the 1980s included tile haphazardly layered over older tile in the bathroom and a weird bookshelf installation that covered up a pass-through to the living room—which meant they had to walk around the entire room to get to their dining table. The kitchen area had wrong-height countertops and an unnecessary wall that separated the space.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The previous owners had added a third </span>bedroom,<span style="color: #000000;"> but it was too small to fit anything other than a bed. The goal was to even out those bedrooms so their boys could have their own rooms, without one of them being seriously shortchanged on space. Barbra and Sean&#8217;s overall vision was for everything to be simple, functional, clean, </span>updated<span style="color: #000000;">, and bright. The co-op had a lot of natural light and they really wanted the renovation to show that off.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-38357 size-full" title="living room and kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-14.jpg" alt="open living room and kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-14-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The couple knew their project was going to be a really big job. They’d renovated a much smaller apartment once before, but it was a simple, cosmetic remodel for resale—nothing like this project. Barbra recalls learning early that she had to do all her research on fixtures, materials, appliances, style, and colors before starting the renovation work to save time and money. &#8220;I never knew how many different types of doorknobs there were—or even realized I had strong preferences in doorknobs,&#8221; she said, &#8220;until I actually had to choose one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The renovation started with bringing the electric up to code. There were unusable outlets and fixtures, and old electric and phone cable lines littered the apartment. Having those ripped out and new lines installed behind the walls &#8220;made my day,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As for the walls themselves, despite having been built in 1935, there really weren’t any remarkable moldings. To keep the space modern but classic, baseboards and doors were kept clean and similar to the originals. To brighten everything up, they installed all new lighting. &#8220;Seeing the non-working track lighting get pulled out of the living room was incredibly satisfying,&#8221; Barbra said. The floors were refinished, which let the original herringbone pattern stand out. &#8220;Refinishing made a bigger difference than I would’ve thought,&#8221; Barbra said.</p>

<p>They had a mural on the foyer wall that a friend had painted when they moved in. They were sad to see it go but knew a statement wall would work there.  &#8220;I love wallpaper but wanted to use it sparingly, so this seemed like the perfect spot for it,&#8221; Barbra said.</p>

<p>Opening up the kitchen and adding a new pass-through closer to the dining area made a huge difference. Their light-filled apartment was even brighter and sunnier now. In the kitchen, they brought in more storage by adding cabinets that went to the ceiling. They loved patterns and bold colors, but aside from the kitchen floor tile, the couple opted to save the patterns for easily changeable items like the wallpaper, rugs, pillows, and paint. As for choosing the navy shade on their cabinets, they felt the layout was classic enough that they could easily swap the door panels out for a new look, if they want it, in the future.</p>

<p>Their desk area had always existed in the kitchen, so when planning the new layout, it seemed natural to carve out an area specifically for this use. They found a desk that fit the opening perfectly and used wallpaper left over from the foyer to give it a more finished look.</p>

<p>Storage was important in other rooms, as well. In the master bedroom, their Sweeten contractor suggested combining the two existing small closets into one large one with a custom closet system. A closet was added to the third bedroom, which now had space after moving the wall, as well as a custom system to one of the entry closets. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more functional space now,&#8221; Barbra said. &#8220;I even have some half-way empty dresser drawers. I wish I had done all the closets. Someday!&#8221;</p>

<p>The other spaces that needed serious attention, of course, were the two bathrooms. They were falling apart and together made up one functioning bath: the master bath had a working shower, but the sink was broken and the second bathroom’s shower didn’t work but the sink did. The working shower had mold and a sinking shower pan. In the bathrooms, they focused on clean lines and classic tile in black/white/gray colors.</p>
<p>While researching materials, &#8220;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/pins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest boards</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> were my friends. I started to find patterns with things that I liked and tagged—from tile patterns and blue color tones to exposed bulb fixtures and wood stain colors—which helped me come up with a style (if you can call it that) for the overall space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It helped to have a clearer idea of the look I wanted to achieve with inspiration photos to refer to and show my contractor.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were also open to ideas from their contractor. They liked that their Sweeten contractor wasn’t a “yes-man” and offered more efficient alternatives to some ideas they presented. He gave them tips on what to splurge on (the custom closets and shower doors, tile) and what not to (custom cabinets) to help them stay within budget.</p>
<p>When they encountered a few bumps in the road, such as waste lines and interior pipes that needed replacement, a delayed vanity cabinet, and a broken dishwasher handle &#8220;he communicated with us right away and offered immediate solutions,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not only was their work stellar, but they were all incredibly nice guys who gave valuable feedback and advice throughout the process. Every element of our home was done with care and with attention to detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything now is clean, airy, and bright; it feels homey, Barbra reports. &#8220;I never wanted to invest in furniture and art because everything felt so temporary,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Now that the space is renovated, I know we’ll live here for many years and can now take the time to invest in pieces that are right for it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First impressions make lasting impressions, and this is as true of your home as it is of anything else in life. Let’s begin with the front door. It’s the focal point of your entry and the feature upon which pretty much everything else hinges—literally. You can go dramatic or understated, but you want a door that works with the style of your house while also keeping it secure and free from drafts. The right choice will set you well on your way to the kind of curb appeal that also gives a boost to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-is-home-equity-and-home-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the value of your home</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s plenty to consider when selecting from front door styles. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers a rundown of front door styles—materials, colors, accessories, and add-ons—to help you navigate the process.</p>
<h3>When should you upgrade a front door?</h3>
<p>In short: security, energy efficiency, and good looks. The appropriate door performs on many levels. It’s also a good investment. The National Association of Realtors advises that homeowners can expect as much as an 80 percent return on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">window and door upgrades</a> at closing. If you’re not moving, this enhancement makes you a better neighbor and a happier homeowner with a prettier front entrance. Prices across front door styles can range from $200 up to $2,000+ if you add on sidelights, transoms, or different finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also seize the opportunity to upgrade security with a newer, more secure lock system. Additionally, you could also get an energy-efficient door that reduces air leakage and cuts your utility costs!</p>
<h3>Finding your front door style</h3>
<p>The choice is yours, and you can have whatever you want—windows or a solid panel, sidelights, or a transom. To maximize curb appeal, you should stick with a door that fits with the architecture of your home. Today’s houses, especially new construction, can often be a hybrid that includes features from different eras. For example, you&#8217;ll see Tudor plus French Revival, or Spanish Colonial plus Craftsman. Consult with a professional (an architect, your contractor, or a door company sales rep) who has experience pairing the right door with a particular house style. You can also research architectural home styles online, like on manufacturers’ websites, and compare what you find with your home. <a href="https://www.thermatru.com/inspiration/doorways-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therma-Tru Doors offers the DoorWays app</a>, which allows you to try out different doors on an image of your own front entrance.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/©2013-Jane-Beiles-PRINT-8700.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31291 mb-10 size-chrono" title="front door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/©2013-Jane-Beiles-PRINT-8700-723x488.jpg" alt="front door" width="723" height="488" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />

<h3>Front door systems and configurations</h3>
<p>You’ll find that entry doors are often referred to as “door systems.” This means they come pre-hung in a frame and pre-drilled for both doorknob and deadbolt, not just a mere rectangular slab. The system should also include the door’s bottom edge, which interlocks with the threshold. It will also likely have weather stripping encircling the door’s perimeter. This setup is convenient and sensible. This way, you purchase all the door features from one manufacturer to ensure everything functions well together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re replacing an existing door, you will want it to be the same size as the previous one, unless you are taking apart the entire entryway for a dramatic change. Changing the dimensions of the door (like adding sidelights or a transom) involves reframing the opening. For this type of involved job, you want to work with a general contractor. Before committing to a particular door, consult with your own contractor to ensure the door will fit. (Do this before it is paid for and delivered!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other terms you’ll encounter are “flush” and “paneled.” Flush doors are flat and smooth on both faces. Paneled doors have rectangular recesses framed by horizontal rails and vertical stiles. Originally, panel construction was meant to minimize cracking and warping on wood doors. They do this by giving the panels room to shift with changes in humidity. The “look” caught on, and it can now be found in other door materials. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>Front door material choices</h3>
<p>When you see the word “door,” you may automatically think “wood.” However, there’s more to materials nowadays, including fiberglass, steel, and wood composites. In each of these categories, doors are typically made of more than one material. Other materials are incorporated to enhance stability and energy efficiency. A wood door may have a steel interior, a steel door may have a wood exterior, a fiberglass door may have a wood frame—all for stability and strength—and most will have some type of foam insulation to fill the interior voids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the materials has its pros and cons, and the versatility to achieve different styles, configurations, and finishes, including the look of woodgrain.</p>
<h4>Fiberglass front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fiberglass doors are a practical choice for most climates, particularly harsh or humid weather. They resist wear and tear extremely well. Available in smooth or embossed woodgrain texture, they can mimic the look of wood and take paint or stain. These doors are dent-resistant, require little maintenance, and typically come with a long warranty, from 20 years to a limited lifetime.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Can crack under severe impact.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $1,500</p>
<h4>Steel front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Steel doors are positioned as the strongest of doors. They will not crack or warp. Coated with a baked-on polyester finish, steel doors will require periodic repainting. Higher-end versions come with a vinyl finish for greater weather resistance. Some manufacturers offer a wood veneer or wood composite coating that can be stained.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Not as weather-resistant as fiberglass or wood doors. They are easy to dent, and dings are hard to fix. Scratches on steel doors may rust if not treated promptly. In extremely high temperatures, the surface can be hot to the touch.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Both steel and fiberglass doors should come with a thermal break that separates the inside and outside door skins. This prevents the transfer of outdoor heat and cold, which can cause frost to form on the inside surface.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $2,000</p>
<h4>Wood front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fans of wood front doors are drawn to its heritage of warmth and the versatility of different species. Wood resists cold and heat. Some wood doors are composed of veneer skin over an engineered wood core. This protects the core from moisture that causes shrinking, swelling, and warping. It’s also the least likely material to dent, and scratches are easy to repair.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Solid doors can be made through a millwork shop, lumberyard, and some door manufacturers, but they are expensive and time-consuming to complete. They also require regular upkeep—painting or varnishing to maintain their appearance—and a protected area in the shade or under an overhang.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $175 &#8211; $2,600</p>
<h3>Decorative details for front doors</h3>
<p>The hardware—hinges, door handle—are practical, while also complementing your door style. Manufacturers will offer further options for customization with decorative glass, grilles, metal trim, and clavos (AKA, decorative door studs). Sidelights and/or a transom also lend visual interest while letting in more light. There’s plenty of choice within the glass category, too—clear, rain, satin, and geometric to name a few. And don’t forget the door knocker, even if you have a doorbell!</p>
<h3>Front door styles: Colors to consider</h3>
<p>A contrasting or complementary door color adds a touch of wit and drama to the entry. Try matching it to the window frames or shutters, if you have them, for a truly coordinated look. Or just go for it with one bold color for the door. Many manufacturers offer color as part of the door selection process, which saves you the trouble of painting. These finishes are formulated to be fade-resistant, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Picking the right front door can feel like a big commitment, and it is. But as with all the right relationships, it’s one that you can depend on and enjoy for many years.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Just as a front door makes a lasting impression on everyone who enters, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior doors</a>—whether they stand out or blend in with their surroundings—impact the overall design of your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>There&#8217;s no need to have a green thumb to enjoy indoor plants at home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether clustered together in a nook or dispersed among various rooms, p<span class="s1">lants let you enjoy the beauty of an indoor garden year round</span>. Beneficial for your health and your living space, they soften the corners of a room,<span class="s1"> work with any color palette</span>, purify the air, and, some experts say, can help reduce stress. We love seeing Sweeten homes filled with greenery, so we set out to discover what kinds of indoor plants our homeowners keep in their homes and how to care for them with advice from Justin Hancock, a professional horticulturist and garden expert at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>. Below are a crop of our favorite plant-filled renovations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23098 size-chrono" title="A snake plant" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/">Samantha’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re looking for a good indoor plant for the kitchen, look no further than the <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/snake-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snake plant</a>. In Samantha’s kitchen, the greenery adds a decorative touch to the island while breaking up the gray and neutral tones of the space. Also known as mother-in-law&#8217;s tongue, it enjoys the extra humidity a kitchen offers and doesn&#8217;t need to be watered regularly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25816 size-chrono" title="A fiddle leaf fig tree" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brett’s living room</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fiddle leaf fig tree in Brett’s living room complements the wall of exposed brick beautifully while the height of the tree makes great use of the tall ceilings. It also acts as a visual barrier between the living room and kitchen, defining each space while allowing them to remain open. Fiddle leaf fig trees love bright, indirect light, so keep it in a sunny room away from windows and be sure to water it whenever the soil feels dry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-08-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21670 size-chrono" title="A collection of plants" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-08-8-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine’s living room</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A wall of exposed red brick in Christine’s living room inspired her to recreate a Moroccan riad—or home with an interior garden. A variety of indoor plants, layered to add depth and visual interest, creates a private retreat within the home. The collection includes a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/get-growing/news/a-guide-to-growing-majesty-palms-indoors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majesty palm</a>, a Red Congo <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/philodendron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philodendron</a>, a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/monstera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monstera</a>, and <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/ponytail-palm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ponytail palm</a>, to name a few. All of these plants need to be watered whenever the top of the soil begins to feel dry and do their best in sunny spots around the home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-04-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21665 size-chrono" title="A hanging pothos" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-04-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine’s bathroom</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When adding a plant to your bathroom, it’s important to find one that can tolerate steam and a high level of humidity. The <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/pothos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pothos</a> plant is the perfect candidate, pictured here in Christine’s bathroom. Hang it from the ceiling and make your bathroom feel like a secret oasis. Also, keeping it in the bathroom is a great way to make watering it super easy; keep the soil moist, but not saturated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24715 mb-24 size-chrono" title="A corn plant in the corner" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brett’s bedroom</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/schefflera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schefflera arboricola</a> on the windowsill, a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/corn-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corn plant</a> in the corner, and a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/dieffenbachia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dieffenbachia</a> on a small side table add a bright boost to Brett’s all-white bedroom. Treat them as decorative elements and mix different species of plants in one room; choose a few varieties that need the same amount of light and water so it’s easy to remember what to do. In this case, these indoor plants benefit from a lot of light and a weekly watering.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>A pothos is a beautiful way to add some greenery to your bathroom; you can hang it from the ceiling or place it in a corner and wrap the vines around your bath like <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pallavi and Keyur</a> did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Diving into a multi-story Brooklyn brownstone renovation, welcoming spaces like the foyer, guest bedroom, and bath get the luxe treatment for friends and family</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Today’s before and after kicks off a three-part series on a Brooklyn brownstone gut renovation in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 2015, Nazli and Larry bought a four-story derelict townhouse and set out to create a home for themselves and their son Nacho. With refreshing honesty on topics ranging from marital disagreement to aging foresight, Nazli shares the behind-the-scenes process of decision-making and what it means to renovate for real life, beyond the photo shoot. The couple—she&#8217;s a consultant for government affairs and he is a broker—envisioned the house as an inviting space for their extended community of family and friends—a home away from home.

<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our home in the <a href="https://www.brownstoner.com/history/bedford-historic-district-approved-by-landmarks-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly landmarked</a> Bedford Historic District. It was a single-family brownstone, roughly 4,000 square feet, which we converted into a two-family home with a garden rental and a triplex for ourselves. The home was built in 1890 by Bedford-Stuyvesant architect Montrose Morris, who also built the nearby Kelly Mansion. He built many of the premier properties for wealthy families of the time, though the four townhouses he built on our street were apparently more of an exercise in creating middle-class lodging. Our home was uninhabitable at the time of purchase, truly<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no heat, no working bathrooms or kitchen, and just…not in good shape. There were original but defunct fireplaces, beautifully preserved paneling and plaster work on the walls, as well as some stained-glass windows (a happy surprise)<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>but no other details remained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We certainly did not go into our renovation thinking that it would be a gut—we couldn’t afford it and we didn’t think it would be necessary. But while attempting to figure out the mechanicals and ductwork, it quickly became apparent that it would be more efficient to take down all the crumbling walls and start from scratch. It wouldn’t be so much more expensive since the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems could be done anew, rather than trying to trace them up 130-year-old walls. There was also so much water damage throughout the house that none of the original flooring could be preserved. The house was a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goals were to meet the basic needs of our family, and tick items off our dream list. My basic vision of a home is a giant kitchen with some other rooms arranged nearby for whatever it is people do outside of a kitchen. Larry was really looking forward to having his own private office, which would allow him to work from home more often and spend more time with our son, Nacho. Our child only cares about fans, so we made sure we had a ceiling fan for him to play with (kidding). Collectively, we love to entertain, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of space for guests and could host for a while without it feeling like a strain. We also knew that as we and our families aged, our needs would be different, and wanted flexibility in how our spaces were configured to allow for changing needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband and I disagreed on most decisions (seriously, renovation is not for the faint-hearted), but there was also a really nice division of labor around what our priorities were. I could care less about the bells and whistles of a “smart” home, but my husband spent a lot of time and effort getting the house wired up on Nest thermostats, security systems, and a Sonos sound system, etc. It’s totally amazing to be able to hear music throughout the house, or turn the heat on remotely and come home to a warm home after a few days away. On the other hand, I really care about the flow of space and a house design that makes it easy to clean and maintain. I thought a lot about our storage options and made a million mock-ups of the kitchen and what each cabinet should be used for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of how we imagined the home, I definitely pictured a more modern space than what we have, but we realized pretty quickly that the house, even with the few remaining details, called for a different type of treatment. Townhouses are tough: they are long and narrow and lighting is always tricky, and I think we both realized if we wanted an ultra-modern design we should have looked at a different type of property. We wanted to honor the feel of this Brooklyn brownstone and preserve as much of the plasterwork and recreate as much of the molding without feeling closed in—the way that many of the more traditional townhouses made us feel. Certainly, we wanted a design that felt as open as possible, but I’m a stickler for storage and we are not minimalists, so real-life storage solutions were key. This meant large closets in every room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky enough <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to find</a> our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect through Sweeten</a> and we really wanted her to come on to do drawings and filings because our contractor, who was also my husband’s best friend, really wanted design as he went along. The goal was to create a beautiful space that was flexible to changing tastes. I view the house, beyond some very bold choices in some of the rooms, as a really great blank canvas for great furniture and our art collection. I didn’t want too much millwork or details that would keep the house stuck in one genre forever. Both for ourselves and our changing needs and tastes and for future owners of the home, it’s nice to be able to create a totally different look and feel in the future without having to do major construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the foyer, which is a work in process. I love that when you enter the home, you see the entire floor. The staircase looks so lovely and grand, especially with the black paint and the landing at the bottom of the stairs to emphasize the grandeur of the steps. There was a crazy wood panel fracture with a mirror at the bottom of the stairs but we all thought it was bulky and awkward and it didn&#8217;t seem to be original to the rest of the stairwell. Our architect convinced us (Larry) to get rid of it and our contractor convinced us to rip up that whole wall and expose the brick. I love the sneak peek into the original brick, and how it grounds the space from the frou-frou antique-looking chandelier and the stained glass. I loved using the same ceramic tile from the dining room in the entry vestibule and again—it was all brought together so beautifully by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painting</a> all of it black.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like all good Iranians, I made sure the guest room was the first one in the house that was set up, furnished, and made available for use. Guests are sacred in our culture and we started having house guests after the first night in our house, and for about three months straight afterward. I think Larry takes more of an American’s tact towards house guests…like fish, they start to stink after three days. But having them on their own floor with their own bathroom certainly makes it easy to have folks around. Oh, how I love having a guest room. Basically, if you paint any room Benjamin Moore Chelsea Gray, it will be close to perfect. I had a different idea about how this room would look but then I inherited this terrible rug from my father’s house in Tehran and had to redo all the bedding to go with the odd mix of muted colors. I love Persian rugs, don’t get me wrong<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>walking on bare floors isn’t my taste. But we followed the rules for a perfect guest room: make sure the bed is comfy, that the closets are empty so guests can use them for their own stuff, and provide a work desk (so you can hold your best friends hostage for weeks at a time in your home, even if they insist they have to go back to LA to “work”).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This guest bathroom is so delightfully boring that I fall asleep looking at its soothing tones. I wish I pushed harder for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moroccan tiles</a> in here. I think the floors we used, which basically mimic the look and feel of concrete, wash the whole room out. Our architect used these floors in a hotel project and I really dug them; they were cheap and cool, but always remember the scale of a home project versus a commercial project. What may look like a great feature in a larger space may not work in a smaller venue. I usually have a Persian rug down on this floor which gives the room some warmth and life. If you are ever unhappy with the flooring, put a rug on it! I can’t say enough about how much I love these subway tiles though<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>they are just varied enough to give them a real handmade look rather than the flat subway tiles we usually see. They come in a gorgeous gray and black as well<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>I failed in not using them in more spots throughout the house; that may be a future project. I love the shower as well, we made it nice and big so that Nacho could have fun in there. We also built a large bench along it with a grip bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our moms visit often, and I find bathtubs to be really dangerous for the senior citizen crowd. We felt good about having a step-in shower and adding features that would make it safe for both Nacho and the grandmas. It’s lovely having the windows in the bathrooms after years of using interior bathrooms with poor ventilation, though we haven’t figured out a good solution for the wood window trim, which is constantly getting wet and will probably crack or mold in the future. I also highly recommend an integrated sink when you have filthy toddlers—makes clean-up so much easier. This was the top half of a vanity and sink combo I bought. We ended up hating the vanity, so I just had our contractor make us a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinet</a>, which is lovely.</p>
