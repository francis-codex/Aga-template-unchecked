										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to set realistic expectations on your client</span><span class="s1"> renovation timelines</span></h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47786 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A speedy construction schedule might seem like the key to happy clients, but realistic expectations may actually be more important in getting to<span class="s1"> the finish line. Sweeten often hears questions and concerns about construction schedules, so we&#8217;re sharing what we’ve learned so you, the contractor, can help clients better understand the moving pieces in a renovation. Sweeten has also shared with blog readers <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most common renovation delays</a> and the actions they can take to be prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The Start Date Gamble</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, everything would be on-site before work starts. But who has room to store a new kitchen for two months before demolition begins? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting a project before everything is delivered is a risk that everyone takes. Help your client see this as a reasonable gamble. </span><span class="s1">One that comes with the benefit of speed and the risk of future delay. Make sure you’re both comfortable with the same bet: that project progress and material delivery will depend on each other down the road.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Talk to Clients about Major Renovation Milestones</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clients often ask, “When will this project be done?”  </span><span class="s2">That question can be tough to answer before the work starts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guide your client to think about major milestones in the project, like:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Target start &#8211;</b>&#8211; <i>Will approvals, design decisions, and other prep needs (like temporary accommodations) affect the date?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Demolition &#8212; </b><i>How long will it take and what might be hidden under floors and behind walls?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Electrical, plumbing, and specialized trades &#8212;</b> <i>Will you need to work with someone else’s schedule and availability?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Inspections &#8212;</b> <i>Will progress pause for inspections?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Finish work &#8212; </b><i>Will materials be available on time?</i><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s always helpful for clients to hear how long a project generally takes from start to finish, so feel free to estimate by days or weeks. But keeping the focus on start date range, major milestones, and potential variables will help your client feel more prepared for what is to come.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Handling Client Expectations for Renovation Surprises</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p>You won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind the walls until you&#8217;re hired and work can begin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p>Discuss with the homeowner the worst-case scenario based on the building&#8217;s age and history. Will there be issues with the electrical, plumbing, or structure? Let them know if they should prepare for contingencies in their budget. You won&#8217;t be able to price out every possible surprise but communicate with the homeowner how you will problem-solve when hurdles arise.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"> Fitting Subcontractors, Crew, and Inspector Schedules into Client Timelines</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten clients are often surprised by downtime once the project starts. They think of a project as moving in a straight line. Also, they may believe you have total control over the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure they aren’t wondering where your crew is! </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Help them understand that some steps depend on sub or vendor scheduling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Talk to them about how inspections need to be scheduled and then wait for the inspector.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that you may need to wait for a more skilled worker to complete a specific step.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make it clear that there may be days where no work is happening and that this is a natural part of the process.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also often hear that a crew started late in the day, or left the site early. This can be a big pain point, especially if your client thinks the project isn’t moving fast enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can get out ahead of this. Make sure your client knows that you are focused on progress, but that you also have to balance:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The logical sequence of work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Availability of materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Individual crewmember health and family issues<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Commitments to other projects<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t mean the project isn’t a priority, it’s simply how you run a business.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sweeten supports many different types of vetted general contractors and firms, ranging in size and specialty</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48298" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final.jpg" alt="Sweeten types of GCs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A wide range of general contracting firms work with Sweeten—just about anyone with a proven record of excellent home renovations in one of our service areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few ways we look at different types of general contractors and contracting firms, and the benefits Sweeten offers each of them.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Size of the General Contracting Firm</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Emerging firms </b></span><span class="s1">are typically small firms that are still working to establish their presence and build a renovation portfolio. Sweeten works with general contracting firms that have been in business for at least six months. In addition to the Sweeten resources that help other small firms, emerging firms benefit from Sweeten’s free project photography, and our $15K minimum budget. Both help you build your portfolio and move from handyman tasks to the kinds of jobs you want. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Small established firms, </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with five or fewer employees, include sole proprietorships and family-run teams. These firms, while small, have specializations and are looking for specific types of projects. You may have limited resources for <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/lead-generation-for-contractors-to-generate-business-and-turn-a-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing and finding new, appropriate leads</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten offers services to help small, but established firms grow and thrive. These include a dedicated account manager, who will feel like a new team member devoted to marketing and business development. Equally important is Sweeten’s strict vetting of all leads, to make sure you’ll waste less time chasing jobs that go nowhere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Large and established firms</b>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with over five employees, typically devote more resources to managing work volume. Sweeten offers large, established firms a full-featured <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/general-contractor-performance-stats-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard to track leads and projects</a>. Multiple team members can be given access to the dashboard. You’ll have full control over lead flow—pausing your account, restarting it, opening up to a wider variety of job types or budgets to land some quick work, or narrowing your focus to slow the flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also benefit from our high project values (2020 average was $67,000), and our lead vetting—we protect your time and resources from clients with the wrong kinds of jobs, or unrealistic budget expectations.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Types of General Contracting Firms</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Build-only firms</b> work from plans drawn by an outside designer or architect, or they handle basic rip-and-replace jobs. When Sweeten qualifies a project, we ask what kinds of services the client needs. We’ll give you all the important information, including if they’re already working with a designer or architect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Design-build firms</b> offer full design services, either by having designers or architects on staff or by having a partnership with outside professionals. When Sweeten determines that a client will need your full services, we prepare them for the associated budget increase.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Everything in between</b>. We work with general contracting firms that offer a wide range of design services, from basic advice on fixtures and finishes to making architect/designer referrals. We will learn your about services and your job preferences and will send you the most appropriate leads with appropriate budgets.   </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketing Capacity</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Firms with a dedicated marketing team.</b> Sweeten offers you an even greater exposure, with opportunities for features on our blog and in the press (<em>Architectural Digest</em>, <em>The Today Show</em>, and other major outlets) which would otherwise be out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Firms without a dedicated marketing team.</b> Sweeten offers you a free start—you get all the marketing benefits of the platform, and only pay when you win a job. And you’ll get the benefits of all our pre-qualified leads, along with our sophisticated digital ad campaigns that target only the right homeowners.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What kind of firm is yours? How can Sweeten help you win?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If you have questions for our account managers about becoming a Sweeten GC, <a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schedule a call</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Estimating overhead and profit are important parts of any project bid. However, underestimating overhead costs on a project often cuts into the profit. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how to manage the cost of your business within a renovation project estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></p>
<h4>How does Sweeten work with general contractors?</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Contractors pay only when they win a project. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 1: Estimating Overhead</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Indirect overhead</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ongoing, or indirect, overhead items keep a business running long term.  There are a number of indirect or ongoing costs. These may include: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Salaries and benefits for employees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Office costs, such as rent, utilities, supplies<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vehicle costs<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Insurance<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Marketing costs, including Sweeten fees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Professional services including accountants, attorneys<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Software licenses<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of these expenses as the &#8220;cost of doing business&#8221; as they allow you to get in the game and operate a successful business. For that reason, many general contractors spread these costs evenly over a number of projects by incorporating them into their overhead and categorizing them as marketing. Others build it into their overhead on a project to project basis. It’s a key decision a contractor needs to make when they’re running their business. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a personal decision! The important point is to treat these fees as business expenses, and not as a reduction in profit. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead costs are costs for specific projects. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Equipment rental<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Job site utilities<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Additional insurance, when required<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Manpower for non-labor charges, such as accepting deliveries and ordering materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Project marketing expenses</span>

<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 2: </span><span class="s1">Presenting P and O Estimates</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some contractors lump profit and overhead costs together. However, separating the two offers an opportunity for the contractor. Most clients don&#8217;t understand the expenses of running a business. Many people assume the profit and overhead number is mostly profit—and they will try to get the GC to reduce it. Separate the two, and it could lead to a better understanding of what is behind the estimate. It explains the cost of doing business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One helpful strategy is to list some of the overhead items that benefit the client.  They will appreciate the transparency and help them understand what they’re paying for. Offering this could separate the contractor from other firms bidding on the project. The client should know if the GC will purchase more insurance or special equipment to make the project successful. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 3: </span><span class="s1">Estimating Profits</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many GC&#8217;s use a standard profit percentage for their renovation project estimates. </span><span class="s4">It is a fairly common practice for GCs to increase or decrease the percentage based on different job factors. A contractor might reduce their profit margins if it looks like the project will run very smoothly. Perhaps a client already has materials on-site, so changes or delays due to delivery issues are unlikely. Some of Sweeten&#8217;s GCs will give a small discount on profit to lock in the job.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the reverse is also true! Projects that appear more difficult for some reason. For example, projects where the clients have a difficult time making decisions and you anticipate delays.  Those types might include a higher profit margin in the bid. This will give you a cushion to fall back on when problems crop up. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 4: </span><span class="s1">Change Orders and Options</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Changes happen on many projects. Account for your cost by including profit and overhead items in the change order procedure. Above all, be sure to be upfront with this practice in the initial contract you sign with the client.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same is true if options, or add-ons, are included in the estimate. Include the profit and overhead in the renovation project estimate for the add-on. In those cases, the profit and overhead are combined with the estimated costs. </span></p>
<h5>Beat the competition with fair, profitable renovation project estimates</h5>
<p>We hope our guide to adding profit and overhead costs to your renovation project estimates was helpful! Knowing how to do this strategically is a crucial step in growing your contracting business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The 5 factors general contractors should consider when picking a site to partner with</span></h2>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48301 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Now is the time to be careful about which jobs you consider, estimate, and take on. Whether you’re looking to grow your business, provide consistency, or focus on niche projects, it’s important to have the right tools to help prioritize your funnel and be more efficient with your time. We encourage you to consider the unique needs of your general contracting business when evaluating the different kinds of business development sites/lead generation for contractors (of course we’re biased and think <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> is the best!)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are the top five factors to consider when choosing a lead generation site to partner with:</span></p>
<h4><span class="s1"><b>1. Does the site charge you upfront, or only if you sign the job?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three basic ways that lead generation platforms can make money: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-to-play: The platform charges you for every potential client they send your way. Costs vary depending on the size of the potential project or quality of the lead. Sites like HomeAdvisor and Porch operate with this model.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-for-placement: the platform charges you for better or more frequent placement on their site. The platform typically also charges either an annual/monthly fee or a fee for every potential client they send your way. Sites like Houzz and Angi follow this model.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-per-win: The platform charges you only when you sign a contract with the potential client. The fee is typically a percentage of the project value. Sites that follow this model are considered true marketplaces, because money doesn’t change hands unless there’s a sale of services. Sweeten is one of the only sites that takes this improved approach.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pay-per-win platforms tie their success to their contractors’ success. These platforms are incentivized to help their GCs win more jobs, as opposed to the other models, which make their money whether or not you succeed. With Sweeten, you only pay when you win a Sweeten project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Tip</b>: Make sure you keep track of your return on investment (ROI) with any lead generation platform you may be considering. </span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>2. Does the site focus on serious renovation projects that require a general contractor, or on handyman tasks?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before signing up with a platform, find out the average size of its projects. Look for a focus that aligns with the work you do, and the work you’re seeking. Many platforms specialize in projects that average just a few thousand dollars. At Sweeten, our average project size in 2019 was $126,000. About 50% of our contracts were over $50,000. Our minimum project size is $15,000. We can win you the kinds of leads that are most profitable, rather than stretching your resources thin with distracting singe-trade work. </span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>3. Does the site focus on the quality or the quantity of remodeling project leads?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask a representative how many leads you would typically see from the platform in a month as well as how they qualify those projects. Sweeten prescreens</span><span class="s2"> every project to make sure its scope and budget align with rates in your area</span><span class="s1">. We also educate potential clients on cost, scope and process, in order to manage expectations from the start. In addition, we support your firm on the project from introduction until the punch list is complete—because your client is our client, and your success is our success. You’ll have a dedicated Sweeten account manager who can offer support during project milestones, and help with any communication problems with our shared clients. And you’ll have access to your Sweeten dashboard, with digital tools for scope support, estimate creation, e-contracts, and digital payments.</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>4. Does the site vet its contractors?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Look for a platform that cares about quality and is committed to improving the renovation process for all parties involved. If you carry a home improvement or general contractors license, insurance, and other certifications, look for a platform that sets you apart from less qualified tradespeople. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Sweeten, we vet every contractor who applies to our network. We accept fewer than 20%. All qualified contractors carry the proper licenses and insurance for their service area, and have a proven record of quality craftsmanship and successful projects. As a Sweeten partner, you’re part of a group of highly-qualified, talented, experienced professionals.</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>5. Does the platform encourage healthy competition?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How many contractors does the platform send to each lead? Are contractors segmented by skill set, company size or services offered? Look for a platform that helps differentiate your firm from the pack! Sweeten matches each project to 3-5 general contractors who are a strong fit, based on the project type and scope. Clients love this because it offers them a manageable number of relevant choices, rather than bombarding them with dozens of questionable ones. Contractors love this because when we match you to a project, you’ll probably find it attractive. And you’ll have a genuine chance of winning. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What sets Sweeten apart from the rest?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sweeten’s digital platform makes managing projects easier</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten’s combination of smart technology and client service means real renovations with real budgets. Our advanced matchmaking service matches each prospective project only to the most compatible general contractors. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sweeten gets to know you and your firm’s strengths for the best fit</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a Sweeten general contractor, you won’t be thrown into a large pool of firms fighting for one project. You’ll get only qualified leads specifically suited to <i>your</i> firm. Sweeten is the best lead-generation source because it provides viable leads, a “pay only when you win model,” and dedicated support to help you succeed.</span></p>
