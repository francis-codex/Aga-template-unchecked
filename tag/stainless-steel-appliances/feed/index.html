<h3>Remodeling an outdated 80&#8217;s West Village kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36013 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36010 size-full" title="jonathan-standing-in-kitchen-with-wife" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg" alt="jonathan standing in his kitchen with his wife in front of white kitchen cabinets and herringbone pattern subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36018 size-full" title="waterfall-kitchen-island-with-cabinet-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pull out drawers inside cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a builder-grade kitchen in Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The birth of the couple&#8217;s first child came two weeks after purchasing a two-story rowhouse in Philadelphia’s Graduate Hospital neighborhood. The baby’s arrival meant that plans to renovate the builder-grade kitchen would have to be put on hold. Fast forward two years later, with another baby on the way, this growing family decided to squeeze in the much-needed renovation before the due date. The kitchen was in dire need of a change: remodeled in 2004, it had generic faux wood cabinets, inefficient appliances, limited storage, and a lack of natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34743 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01-723x722.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia" width="723" height="722" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: As a couple who loves to cook and dine in their eat-in kitchen, the homeowners wanted to make it brighter and more efficient. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten were matched with a general contractor. “[The kitchen] gets a LOT of use as the main backdrop for our lives,” the homeowner explained. The biggest change on the list of must-haves was the relocation of the exterior door to another wall in order to make room for a seating nook. To boost the flow of sunlight, a new window was planned for the spot where the old door originally stood. Inspired by the homeowner’s experience working in museums, the new kitchen, with flat-front all-white cabinets, unobtrusive hardware, and few distractions on the countertops, would feel similar to the clean backdrop of an empty gallery space; bright and full of potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34752 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08-723x1012.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertops, white cabinets, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="1012" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The white quartz <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a> and backsplash create a clean backdrop while the emerald green <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile </a>adds plenty of character. Most of the improvements in the kitchen—a trash can tucked behind a cabinet door and drawers beneath the sink—felt like the missing pieces of the puzzle. New <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appliances</a>, including a smaller refrigerator taking up less space and a range hood that vents outside instead of recirculating air inside, are all energy-efficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34746 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, white cabinets, seating nook" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34747 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, seating nook, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The first-time renovators discovered you may not know what you&#8217;ll find behind the walls in your home. In the process of moving the entrance, their Sweeten contractor opened up the walls and uncovered missing overhead support beams, structurally unsound vertical supports, mysterious gaps of empty space, and interior-grade drywall behind the exterior siding instead of plywood. He patiently and quickly worked to solve the serious problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34755 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, range hood, white quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34749 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, range hood, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing the issues behind the walls extended the timeline from 2-3 months to 6 months. The baby was born in the middle of it all, but now that work is done, the family has peace of mind knowing their home is structurally sound. “We love our new kitchen,” the homeowner tells us, “We realize that while it might be too monochrome for some, it&#8217;s exactly what we wanted.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill home gains flexible space with sliding doors</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, open shelving, bar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, native New Yorkers Margery and Jim Fields worked in Manhattan and lived just outside the city. In 1996, the family relocated to Philadelphia when Jim was transferred for a job. The couple always had a special place in their hearts for New York, and when their kids grew up, they decided it was the right time to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33866 size-chrono" title="Margery and Jim" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34597 size-chrono" title="view" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34566 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they began their search for an NYC home, they wanted something a bit unique. They looked at many listings, but it was the view from their apartment at the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (a Brooklyn complex near and dear to us here at Sweeten, after renovating so many homes there!) that sold them on the one-bedroom place they ended up purchasing. They loved the sweeping view of Manhattan—the island that drew them back to the five boroughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33868 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33875 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, spot lighting, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment itself was a different story. It hadn’t been updated in 40 years and had been chopped up with too many walls. Despite this, they decided that the incredible views were worth the trade-off of having to renovate. After a remodeling of their Philadelphia kitchen several years ago, they had a good idea of a wishlist for their next project. They wisely decided to live in the space for six months before starting the design process to get a feel for how they would use it—and to understand the light&#8217;s effect in the apartment at various times of the day. They heard about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, from their neighbors, and it kept coming up in conversation. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this Sweeten contractor</a>, who had previously done several projects in the Clinton Hill Co-ops.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34564 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33869 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34108 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a-723x484.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="484" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once discussions got underway, they made some decisions with the help of their Sweeten contractor; prior work in the building meant he knew what was behind the walls and what to anticipate, so was able to guide Margery and Jim on what actions would need to come next in the process. He knew the bathroom ceiling was a drop ceiling and would be able to install the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlighting</a> they wanted. Their contractor was also familiar with the building&#8217;s wiring and informed them it would not support an induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was an industrial-yet-modern aesthetic. They wanted to take down the walls boxing in the kitchen and allow as much light into the space as possible. The full scope included a new kitchen and bath as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33873 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, sliding door, french door, open shelving, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Margery and Jim planned to convert the dining nook beside the kitchen into a second bedroom but ultimately decided on a flex-space solution made possible by sliding doors. When they didn’t need the second bedroom, the doors could remain open to take full advantage of the two large windows in the nook. The contractor created a custom solution by fusing two estate-sale-find French doors that Margery and Jim had found to make a sliding pocket door. The renovated nook is now a seating area that can be closed off from the living room to create a guest sleeping area that feels like a “studio within the apartment,” explained Margery. It is also a cozy spot for guests to perch when the pair entertain and are preparing food in the kitchen. (Given that Jim has seven brothers who are all married, they definitely need the seating for guests!)</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33876 mb-0 size-chrono" title="long-blue-kitchen-cabinet-peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" alt="long blue kitchen cabinet with knob and white kitchen peninsula with cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen revamp, Jim and Margery decided on dark gray cabinets paired with a light quartz countertop and glass subway tile. The contractor suggested a full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> next to the refrigerator on the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, providing unexpected bonus storage. On the other side of the fridge, open shelving is built onto a mirrored backsplash for maximum light reflection into the kitchen. Corner shelving was added, with a Lazy Susan to maximize under-counter space leaving enough room for a full-size dishwasher.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33877 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, subway tile, stainless steel appliances, sliding door, spot lighting" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33878 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-blue-kitchen-cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" alt="gray blue kitchen cabinet with oven and a white door after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple intended to add a kitchen island at first. But when they saw how open the space felt without it, they chose to leave it as is. Similarly, the original design called for stainless steel shelving to be added to the back wall above the sink but decided to leave it open for an airier feel overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33882 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33881 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33879 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, bathroom, large-format tiles, vinyl tub, bronze penny floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Margery and Jim were able to make use of another estate sale find—the black large-format tiles, which cost a dollar a piece. They paired those tiles with an unusual bronze <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny tile</a> Margery had once seen and admired in a restaurant. A cast-iron tub was swapped out for a vinyl one that allowed the contractor to bring the wall tile around the front to tie the space together. Modern Brizo fixtures helped to finish the clean, streamlined look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that their project is complete, Margery and Jim have a few words of wisdom for would-be renovators. They stress the importance of selecting the right contractor—one with whom you can have a good “communication cadence,” said Margery. “We would text or talk to our contractor multiple times a week, or multiple times a day as things came up. That ability to instantly communicate would keep things from being delayed or misinterpreted.” They love the openness of the new layout, &#8220;while keeping some separation between the kitchen and main living space,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad we didn&#8217;t take out the bar/pantry wall.&#8221; Check out their Behind-The-Reno video below:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Now you can have America’s-next-top-chef pro-style quality at home</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone" title="a chef's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-11-723x487.jpg" alt="White galley kitchen with commercial style kitchen appliances" width="723" height="487" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em> (Above)</em> Cara and Jared <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/">kitchen renovation</a></span></p>
<p>When commercial appliances first appeared on the home kitchen scene some 20 years ago, they were the couture of cooking: beautiful, very expensive, and available only to a select few who could manage the price tag and installation. With the renaissance of home entertaining and the widespread popularity of cooking shows, manufacturers have answered the homeowners’ call for a commercial style that can easily fit into a new or renovated kitchen. Looks still lead the way, with shimmering stainless steel and sturdy controls. Function has kept up, too, thanks to improvements in cooking, cooling, and cleaning, to justify that price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Ranges </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s much easier these days to purchase a commercial-style kitchen range for a home. You&#8217;ll find ranges that provide the function you seek, at a size and scale that fits into a home kitchen. Serious at-home chefs covet range features like cast-iron grates, stainless-steel surfaces, and quick-to-heat burners controlled by sizeable knobs. The controls with the <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCS collection from Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> are illuminated, a safety feature that adds an extra touch of glamour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another benefit of commercial-style kitchen ranges: they offer flexibility, which home cooks need. One such example is dual fuel, or ranges that feature a gas cooktop plus an electric oven. This provides the immediacy and control of a gas cooktop, with cooking power of up to 25,000 BTUs, and the precise performance of a true convection oven. Modern ranges also have digital panels that help you program correct temperature and cooking times to assure perfect results.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a commercial-style range, there are a few drawbacks you should consider. Some commercial-style kitchen range models have smaller oven cavities than their non-pro-style counterparts, so check the size to make it can handle your Thanksgiving turkey. The self-cleaning feature may also need to be sacrificed if that’s not important to you. Luckily, you’ll make it up in adjustable grates, cooktop grills, and superior simmering capabilities with flames that go as low as 140 degrees. Some brands have unique features. Thermador’s burners, in the shape of the company’s star emblem, disperse the flame heat to more evenly heat the entire surface of a pot. Fisher &amp; Paykel’s racking system allows the rack to extend as much as 75 percent outside the oven cavity, handy when removing a heavy dish, like a roast or a Dutch oven.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Refrigerators</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first commercial kitchen refrigerators to capture the imagination came with glass doors. It&#8217;s ideal for a professional kitchen, as many chefs working together simultaneously need to see what’s inside quickly and easily. For the home cook, <a href="https://true-residential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True Refrigeration</a> offers a stainless-framed glass door option reminiscent of that commercial version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key feature of a commercial kitchen fridge is stainless steel. As an external material, it lends a pro-style touch. Also, some manufacturers, like True, offer stainless steel as an interior finish, too. Newer fridge models have black stainless steel for an extra touch of drama. Considering color? <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueStar</a> claims to have more than 750 colors and finish combos to match its cooking products.</p>
<h4>Features inside the fridge</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s going on behind cool-looking doors is just as important to the home chef, who may shop once a week and needs all that food to stay fresh. Look for features like individual climate-controlled drawers, adjustable racking systems, and extra-large shelves to hold entertainment platters and pizzas. <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermador</a> has introduced removable bins on the fridge door that can be loaded with ingredients for meals during the week, then removed to the kitchen counter when it’s time to prep dinner.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-style Dishwasher</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Real commercial dishwashers, perhaps surprisingly, lack all the features that homeowners have come to depend on. They basically serve to wash and sanitize, so you won’t find them with adjustable racking systems or garbage disposals. In fact, with a true pro version, you would have to thoroughly rinse the glasses and dishes before placing them in the washer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re set on a commercial-style, dishwasher, start with stainless steel. This sparkling metal says the appliance means business, just like its cooking and cooling counterparts described above. Hefty, architectural handles complete the pro-style effect (unless you prefer a look with controls hidden on the inside panel.) Inside, look for adaptable features like adjustable or removable racks and baskets. As for function, there’s plenty from popular manufacturers to make you happy, including a range of wash cycles, a timer, super-quiet operation, and a childproof lock. Want all the bells and whistles? Spring for a third rack from manufacturers like Bosch, or a built-in water softener from <a href="https://www.jennair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn-Air</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-Style Kitchen Faucets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of the pull-out <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucet</a> two decades ago forever changed our impression of this indispensable kitchen tool. Finally, with minimum effort (and splashing), you could spray the entire sink—as well as the inside of a pasta pot. Commercial-style kitchen faucets take this advantage a step further. Many offer single-handle operation, a higher-than-average arc, and a spray that can swivel 360 degrees. Look to plumbing experts like <a href="https://www.isenbergfaucets.com/kitchen/">Isenberg</a>, <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/kitchen-faucets/article/CNT125900008.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and <a href="https://www.grohe.us/kitchen/kitchen-faucets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grohe</a> for more handy options. There are even options for foot control, for completely hands-free operation, like the pros enjoy. If you love sparkling water, Grohe also makes a pro-style faucet that puts fizz in your tap water when you want it.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peek inside a commercial kitchen and you’re likely to see stainless steel on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter surfaces</a>. The sanitary, odor- and moisture-impervious benefits are obvious. However, dings and scratches become pretty obvious. If the patina of usage isn’t for you, check out natural or engineered stone. Professional chefs love it for the same reasons homeowners do: it can take heat without scorching, yet stays cool to the touch. Natural stones such as granite and marble will, nevertheless, show stains, so if you don’t want to risk marring the perfect surface, consider an engineered stone like <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa/what-is-dekton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dekton</a> or <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caesarstone</a>, which claim to resist all liquids, including wine and juice.</p>
<h4>Creating a commercial-style kitchen at home</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning a kitchen renovation involves loads of decisions as you work your way through all the choices for appliances and materials. Commercial style kitchens, while at the higher end of the budget spectrum, remains a classic, and a trend with staying power, if you take the time to find those products that sync with your individual cooking style.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A busy Brooklyn cook space is renovated after a three-year delay</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27343 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen, renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Brighten up a long, thin kitchen in Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: When Sarah and her husband bought their two-bedroom co-op in Prospect Heights, the plan was to renovate the kitchen soon after. Unfortunately, it turned out a coat closet shaped like a column that stood in the middle of the living room was built into the floor and worse, had all the electrical wiring for the home running through it (the building was built in 1907). Removing that and redoing the floors took priority. After three years, a DIY bathroom renovation, and a baby, the family felt ready to tackle the long, thin, and grim kitchen and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached out to Sweeten</a>, which matched them with vetted contractors. The floors were cracked and the cabinets covered in grunge, despite Sarah’s best bleaching efforts. The very-average oven couldn’t keep up with the growing family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <b>After</b></span>: The main goal of the renovation was a brighter kitchen, but there was only a small window to work with. That meant relying on a color scheme to do the job. “I think we would have gone more rustic if we had more light,” said Sarah. Rather than going with all white “that seemed a little much,” she said, they picked out a light gray for the cabinets. They pondered using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ikea</a> for the cabinets, but in the end, their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a> built them custom. The tall units that reached the ceiling made the kitchen feel bigger while adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage space</a>. The cabinet that allows the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microwave</a> to float provided storage without taking up floor space. <span class="s1">It was an ideal spot since they opted for a quality range hood rather than a microwave/hood combo. </span>For a family with two cooks, the kitchen is in operation most nights. The previous design had about a foot of usable counter space because of an awkwardly placed sink. There was some too-small-to-be-useful counter space to the left between sink and fridge, so their Sweeten contractor suggested shifting the sink. “It’s not centered, but it means we have over two feet of counter space,” said Sarah. “For us, it has just changed everything.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Surviving with a microwave and takeout for most of the renovation turned out to be &#8220;kind of nice,” said Sarah. “It wasn’t as expensive as we thought it was going to be.”</p>

Mud was applied to level the surface, in preparation for durable faux wood ceramic planks that butt together with minimal grout, like real timber flooring (read: low maintenance!).</p>
<p>Gutting walls around the room gained a sliver of extra space for counters. Slightly deeper new countertops are white quartz, to bounce light around. Adding a dishwasher cost storage space below the counter, so to compensate for the loss, much taller upper cabinets go right to the ceiling, where oversized crown molding is painted to match the Shaker-inspired doors featuring soft-close.</p>
<p>A drafty-in-winter exhaust fan got nixed to make room for a stainless shelf and compact microwave. Muddy brown backsplashes are replaced with bold teal 1940’s-inspired tile laid like bricks, their white grout highlighting a graphic running-bond layout.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A one-bedroom in a coveted West Village condominium designed by famed architect Emery Roth offered a multitude of positives to a new Manhattan buyer: Impossibly desirable location, soaring ceilings, deep closets, residential amenities, and a quiet retreat for work or play. But this lovely home’s kitchen was relegated to a tight little galley, and though the finishes were once beautiful, the dark and heavy cabinetry blocked light and cut access to the living and dining rooms. Eric, the new owner, came to Sweeten to find a contractor who could smoothly navigate the management requirements in this pre-war building and bring a serious carpentry and craftsmanship approach to flow and finishes in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17046 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eric-kitchenV2.jpg" alt="custom wood cabinets" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eric-kitchenV2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eric-kitchenV2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><span id="more-17044"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making real design changes to a pre-war pad can prove rather daunting &#8211; many of Manhattan’s most sought-after buildings have deep historical roots, celebrity architect imprints, and cautious alteration agreements that limit updates. Eric saw an opportunity to open up the kitchen in his new place and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his renovation project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten &#8212; we matched him with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cabinet and millwork specialist who could also manage strict building requirements and oversee all aspects of the project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Alan, designing new custom cabinetry to lighten the space was the easy part. Finding a way to incorporate more natural light and reconnect the rooms was the primary challenge. Eric had hoped to take down the entire wall separating the kitchen and living room where the paneled fridge stood, but the building’s interior pipes stood in the way, so the crew decided to open the wall with a large pass-through instead. The team also planned to replace floors throughout the apartment and targeted the old-school linoleum in the kitchen as a starting point.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17057" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan stripped the black and white linoleum squares and laid white oak planks down in their place, finished with a glossy clear stain throughout the entire apartment. The cabinets were torn out and replaced with a detailed custom oak set, mostly constructed and completed onsite. Incorporating a lot of glass into the design, Alan created open, closed, and shelving variations in a combination of natural-stained and painted white finishes. The new pass-through provides light from the kitchen window and the living room windows in both directions, and Alan played up the new light with windowed display cabinets above the counter and bar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17049" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="manhattan galley kitchen" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17050" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="custom cabinetry" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the partial wall and new footprint more functional, Alan moved the refrigerator to the adjacent wall and constructed a food pantry to mimic the rest of his oak cabinetry, finished with heavy metal hardware and pulls. Ivory Caesarstone countertops replaced black granite, and an undermount brushed stainless steel sink with matching faucet were installed. Because the kitchen’s back wall is so visible from the living room, the team went with a neutral, luminous glass-tiled backsplash and open shelving above the sink. New stainless steel appliances, including a hefty gas burner, contrast with the warm wood and are easy to keep clean. Alan took Eric’s vision for more light very seriously, adding a number of under-cabinet and recessed sources, as well as a striking ceiling fixture centerpiece. As a bonus, Alan constructed a bar counter on the living room side of the pass-through, perfect for open entertaining. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Laura uploaded seventeen “before” photos to her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a>, a few things were very clear: if you could look past the black-paint-encrusted kitchen cabinets and cracked purple bath tiles, these Aussie expats had the makings of a spacious apartment with oversized windows in one of Brooklyn’s loveliest little neighborhoods. But the home’s tight nooks made it hard to even get a clear “before” photo of any one room. The layout was segmented with lots of little walls and doors, the parquet flooring had long ago given way, and the bathroom was filled with miniaturized fixtures. With sights set on a summer wedding and juggling all of the budget demands that come with new homeownership, we introduced Laura and Matthew to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a> for a kitchen, bathroom, ceiling, and flooring renovation in their Clinton Hill co-op!</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>&#8220;This was definitely a dream on a budget and our contractor and his incredible team really made that happen! The Sweeten process and people were amazing and we really can&#8217;t thank them enough for all of their help. We are gearing up for 70 Australians to come to our wedding &#8211; SO SO excited to show them what we have created!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; Laura, Brooklyn homeowner</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The plans were ambitious but clear: demolish the kitchen wall to unite the kitchen, dining, and living rooms, re-build cabinetry and replace all finishes, gut the bathroom, clear out popcorn ceilings, and redo the floors. The demolition would leave a support column in place and center entertaining and seating around a new island, all in an entirely upgraded space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired parquet flooring came up and warm wood planks went down in their place. The original kitchen cabinets appeared to have been painted many times over—when Laura and Matthew adopted them they were thick with black paint. The couple had put in long hours at Ikea to design new cabinets, and their contractor&#8217;s team did the heavy lifting to install double lines of cabinetry in dove gray with brushed brass pulls. A large island now separates the kitchen from the living room, while offering bar seating, plenty of table space for entertaining, and hidden storage underneath. Mismatched counters were replaced with striking butcher block, and the sink was swapped for a deep stainless version with a tall, elegant faucet. Laura and Matthew chose an ivory honeycomb backsplash with gray grout and upgraded appliances to sleek stainless steel.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Ohhh, look! There&#8217;s that iconic Clinton Hill Co-op kitchen window…!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had also presumably seen kinder days. The floor consisted of gray tiles accented with smaller black and white pieces arranged in an art deco pattern, providing plenty of creative inspiration to work with while maintaining a familiar color theme throughout the home.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team removed the bathroom door and re-created the entry with a sliding track door—a huge space-saving move. Laura and Matthew chose stark all-white subway wall tiles lined with contrasting gray grout to replace the former lavender ones&#8211;many of them broken. The tub stayed with a glaze refresh and gained a large rain showerhead and new fixtures. The big surprise in the bathroom came in the form of a brightly lacquered red vanity, adding a serious punch of color and modernity. A double-sided mirrored medicine cabinet brings extra storage, and strip lighting was upgraded to a streamlined bulb set. The newly expanded vanity carves out just enough room for a simple two-piece white porcelain toilet.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s work in the bedroom was more cosmetic but equally transformative. The building&#8217;s corner beams and beautiful windows are the focal point now that the popcorn ceilings and parquet floors are gone!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought maybe the lighting was off in the “before” photos, but it turns out this Kensington kitchen really was coated in olive green&#8230; in all directions! On a mission to renovate quickly after buying the place, a Brooklyn family came to Sweeten for clever kitchen renovations plus some bonus dining room storage. Read on for Brandi’s take on making this space a home for a growing family.</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/brandis-kensington-kitchen-dining-room-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16783" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brandi-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation kensington" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brandi-kitchen-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brandi-kitchen-1-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Brandi, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-16765"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We bought our Kensington co-op apartment about a year ago, knowing we’d need a full kitchen renovation. The apartment had a wall oven that did not work, and the cabinets had so many layers of paint on them, the hinges wouldn&#8217;t close. Not to mention they were painted a horrifying olive green. The backsplash was cracked and yellowing, the floor tiles were beige-y pink (and also cracked), and all of the appliances needed updating. And because it is a galley kitchen and not very big, we wanted extra storage space in the dining room.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16782" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn&#8217;t have that many ideas when we first started. I knew it would be clean and mostly white, I wanted glass tiles for the backsplash, some sort of natural stone counter, and I wanted a fridge with the freezer on the bottom. Also, the kitchen is in the middle of the apartment so we were looking for ways to bring more light in. A lovely neighbor had shown us how well L-shaped wall cut-outs could work to brighten and enlarge the space, so</span> we started with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little by little we pieced together a plan, just through doing research on places like Sweeten and Pinterest and looking at what we liked and what we didn&#8217;t. </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3362">We decided to post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten, and were matched with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Paul</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We spoke to a few contractors and he was the one who had the most creative and constructive feedback on early design plans. For instance, he didn&#8217;t automatically agree with me on how we should assemble the cabinets in the dining room (I initially wanted high wall cabinets which we later scrapped), and ultimately we took his suggestions and he was right. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ended up choosing marbled cork floors, white lacquer IKEA cabinets with modern pulls, bright granite counters, sea green glass backsplash tiles, and stainless steel appliances. Our favorite features are the undercabinet lighting, the easy access spice drawer, and the slightly larger stainless steel sink.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul built the dining room console with IKEA cabinets and granite counters, which gives us just the right amount of storage without taking over the whole room. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor tiles were my idea; I loved that they are earth friendly, good for the back and knees, and fairly inexpensive. We had our eye on a different tile but when it came time to purchase, they were out of stock so we made a last minute trip to Lumber Liquidators a week before work began and found another design we liked. They look fine, but I did learn that cork has a major drawback: just a year later you can see the wear and tear on them, with pieces of the veneer flaking off around the edges. Not hugely noticeable, but buyer beware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also regretted ordering cabinets through IKEA. Yes &#8212; it was much cheaper than anywhere else, but about half of the cabinet doors and drawer fronts we ordered were out of stock for about six months (and this was from their brand-new cabinet line!). Over those six months, we probably made the trip to IKEA 15 times; we were frequently told that items were in for pick up, only to arrive and find out they were not actually there. We tried to order pieces online and then received the wrong things. </span>Paul was incredible, and it was not his fault that the cabinet orders were so off, but it was a big hold-up over the course of several months and we ended up assembling half the cabinet fronts ourselves. The cabinets do look great, and we are so grateful to Paul &#8211; we loved working with him!</p>
