				<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The use of the kitchen pantry and island continues to evolve. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Islands are increasingly the center of <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen layouts</a> thanks to their multiple uses. Over 60 percent of homeowners use kitchen islands to eat meals. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, the same amount of homeowners use islands for meal preparation. This allows for more counter space along with greater interaction between the cook and guests as food is prepared. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen island has become another place for remote work and learning. Just under 60 percent of homeowners use islands for these purposes. If you&#8217;re ready to renovate, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find the right contractor</a> at Sweeten to see how a kitchen island can work in your space.</span></p><h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pantries—more than food storage</span></h3><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not only are small appliances often stored in pantries, but 67 percent of homeowners use the space to operate those appliances. As a result, this contains any mess and keeps the jumble of cords and power outlets out of sight.  </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A similar percentage of kitchens utilize pantries as coffee centers. Like mini cafe counters, coffee appliances, utensils, and ingredients are within easy reach. A smaller number of homeowners use pantries to store cookware, operate microwaves, and for food prep. </span></p>					</div>

			<h2><strong>These classic Colonial kitchen renovations show interiors ready for modern-day life</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45098" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) The 1919 Colonial of Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-1919-colonial-house-finds-renewal-in-soft-tones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda and Cory</a></span></span></p>
<p>The quaintness of Colonial-style homes is undeniable. Usually marked by two or three stories and brick or wood facades, these dwellings are traditionally found on the east coast. They are typically characterized by a simple almost minimalist shape. The floor plan keeps the kitchen and dining room on the first floor with bedrooms on the second. And while some have open-concept layouts, it is more common to see separation between rooms. They are also easy to remodel by adding on to the side or back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we look at three Colonial kitchen renovations by Sweeten—examples of their older interiors redone to bring in modern style and conveniences.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bringing a Tudor Colonial into the next century</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="blue gray kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34775" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Built in 1912, </span>Nilda and Brian’s<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tudor Colonial in Westchester County, NY, desperately needed a remodel. The 4,400-square-foot home featured a kitchen that was last updated almost 60 years ago. It was time for a change. “The floor was three inches off-level,” says Nilda. “You could peek through the floor to the basement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="backyard entry" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34776" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The couple hired a Sweeten contractor for the remodel. To honor the historic style, they maintained some separation between the kitchen and the other living spaces. New cabinets, flooring, and lighting updated the look. They also opened up the back wall to install a patio door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They kept a traditional feel by opting for Shaker cabinets in a modern gray color. The butler’s pantry also keeps the turn-of-the-century vibe but with a contemporary twist.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A Colonial Revival home gets rejuvenated</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44333" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Fiske Terrace, Brooklyn, is a quiet enclave built at the turn of the 20th century. Interestingly, the Flatbush neighborhood is filled with Colonial Revival homes. So when </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/modern-colonial-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nydia and Jonathan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bought their 3,240-square-foot home in 2012, they decided to renovate. But at the time, they put off the larger renovation of the outdated kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen, renovation, remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37425" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Eventually, they turned to Sweeten to find the right contractor for their old-home renovation. They wanted to take advantage of the natural light the house afforded. However, like in many other Colonial home renovations, the small windows blocked out the light. As a solution, they replaced them with white-framed ones. In addition, they updated the kitchen with gray-blue cabinets and brushed gold accents. These design choices make the aesthetic modern yet still warm and inviting. The bonus? The exposed brick from the chimney area brings even more character.</span></p>
<h3><strong>From challenged to Colonial charming </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg" alt="drip dishware collection" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dated salmon-colored Formica didn’t stop </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-1919-colonial-house-finds-renewal-in-soft-tones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda and Cory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from buying their 1919 Colonial home. For a while, they actually found it charming. However, they knew eventually it needed to be renovated. They hired a Sweeten contractor to update the kitchen to accommodate their family’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On their list of goals was creating a better flow of traffic and light. A challenge of renovating Colonial homes is their notorious separation of rooms. The main entrance to the kitchen by way of the dining room was too narrow. As a result, it isolated the kitchen. But taking down the wall felt disrespectful to the house’s character, so instead, they simply widened and centered it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="old house kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a lot of Colonials, there was some asymmetry in the house. One example was the sheetrock box-beam in the kitchen. They assumed it encased something hard to move, so they left it. However, they fixed the problem by giving it a matching beam which created symmetry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our new space makes us feel happy,” says Amanda. “It feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.”</span></p>

			<h2>4 ways to renovate for an entertainment kitchen that&#8217;ll help gatherings go smoothly</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41135 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Image of a New Jersey kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you love to entertain, you&#8217;ll look at your living spaces for optimal flow and comfort. Whether<span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting together a gathering, large or small, and in any season, your space needs to be functional and efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the kitchen is the main hub for entertaining, a few changes can get your space soiree-ready. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we look at recent Sweeten kitchen renovations that keep homeowners entertainment-ready. Organized pantries, a peninsula or island for workspace, or removing walls so that everyone is brought in on the action are just a few ideas.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>Parties are made possible by pantries</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any chef will tell you, you should always keep some basic culinary staples in the house. Even a simple stash allows you to throw together a last-minute dinner party. But storing these must-have ingredients (think stocks, spices, and starches) means freeing up space in your kitchen. That’s where a well-designed pantry comes in! These pantries are also clutch even if you have a longer time to plan a party, since they can be used to store your serving dishes and other accouterments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-50510 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg" alt="gray kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white countertop and large pantry shelf after renovation" width="2560" height="1707" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the case for Sweeten homeowners </span> Nilda and Brian <span style="font-weight: 400;">. They chose shallower cabinets but a wider pantry unit. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t lose anything in the back and can save the money by not adding the mechanical pullouts you would need for deep pantries,” says Nilda.</span></p>
<h3>Open-concept equals open house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a large space to host is a homeowner&#8217;s dream. However, many spaces don’t start out open and airy, especially if your home or apartment is older. But by taking down a wall or even just part of it, you can make your kitchen more inviting and comfortable for guests when entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45624 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Image of an open concept kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montclair, New Jersey, couple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) turned to Sweeten to help turn their “old” kitchen into a more livable space—with room for entertaining. They tore down two walls, including the wall between the dining room and kitchen to create an open concept. Plus, they also found enough space for an island counter—a double win for entertaining! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="large-window-in-dining" class="alignnone wp-image-41291 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="large window in the dining area and kitchen island with pendant lights and picture frame molding on walls and tile flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Joe’s New Jersey kitchen renovation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Sweeten also included a redesign of their kitchen layout. They asked their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contractor to knock down a wall to get better sightlines to the wall of windows in their living room. Unfortunately, the entire wall could not be removed as it was load-bearing. So their contractor took down as much of the wall as possible but was still able to make a space that is great for entertaining.</span></p>
<h3>Kitchen islands provide staging space</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating a center island in kitchen design has long been popular, and for good reason! Kitchen islands provide a large meal prep area, as well as space for guests to gather around. Kitchen islands are great for storage, too. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowner and frequent party host, Dawn,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included a center island in her recent kitchen remodel for exactly these reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="Image of a large peninsula in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner,” says Dawn (<em>above</em>). “With a much bigger peninsula, we confine the prep/cooking work to one half of the surface while making room for an attractive presentation on the other.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/west-village-nyc-condo-renovation-nyc-enters-new-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-large-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-50484 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1.jpg" alt="white kitchen island in a large kitchen with white cabinets and light brown over head cabinets after renovation" width="2500" height="1667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1.jpg 2500w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/west-village-nyc-condo-renovation-nyc-enters-new-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil and Ilene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also wanted a kitchen island included in their Sweeten renovation plans. It was important to “make smarter use of the space…and be flexible for when their children and grandchildren visit.” Mission accomplished.</span></p>
<h3>Get the appropriate appliances</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48923 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg" alt="Image of a small entertainment kitchen" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When renovating, you have to divide your must-have vs. your nice-to-have design elements. And, if you love entertaining, you know it’s all about the food. Even though their kitchen was only 70-square-feet, Sweeten homeowners and avid cooks </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/one-bedroom-renovation-chelsea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla and Jesse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) made it their focus to include full-size appliances. That meant a 30-inch stove, a large refrigerator,<em> and</em> a dishwasher. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge),” says Kayla. With their new entertainment kitchen, the couple can create their favorite dishes for friends and family more easily.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44787 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Image of a chef-friendly galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also avid cooks, wanted a chef-friendly redesign for their galley kitchen. But unlike a lot of homeowners, they wanted to keep the layout. Daniel considers the galley configuration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>

<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Keeping the gallery style</h3>
<p>Since<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/"> galley kitchens</a> are, by definition, usually small and narrow, renovators typically decide to open up the layout as much as possible when remodeling—whether it involves partially removing a wall or creating a passthrough. However, Daniel, a Culinary Director at Serious Eats and his wife, Kate (a director at <em>VICE</em>) decided to buck the trend and embrace their floor plan, updating it to make it a true chef&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="669" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21198" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p>There were some very visible problems that had to be addressed. The kitchen’s floor tiles had developed corrosive stains over time that could not be scrubbed clean, the cabinets extended to a generic height that wasted space, and some unfortunate layout decisions positioned an old, hulking fridge at the entryway. Worse, the fridge and stove footprints forced the right side of the galley into three abridged sections that were not useful for real food prep. On the other side, plumbing risers in the wall pushed one section of cabinetry out by a few inches, creating an odd corner in the middle of the countertop and adding a few inches of cabinet bulk right at eye level above the sink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44783" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21173" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>In need of more functionality</h3>
<p>Design flaws aside, the room felt claustrophobic, so most visitors assumed that the problem was with the galley itself. Common in pre-war apartments, the dividing wall between the kitchen and dining room could conceivably have come down, and everyone asked about it. But Daniel and Kate found themselves advocating for preservation as the galley began to play a central role in their big-picture decision-making. Ultimately, Daniel felt really comfortable in a galley: It was like a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate turned to </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for help in finding a design and build firm. They had saved up for this renovation and wanted it to be right—making their two-bedroom, pre-war apartment in Jackson Heights, New York, even more desirable.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="size-full wp-image-44780" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21172" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Perfecting the details</h3>
<p>The general contractor that Daniel and Kate found through Sweeten shared the couple&#8217;s vision, committing to getting the fridge out of the entryway as well as installing custom cabinets to expand storage vertically. Offset cabinets were traded in for open shelving above the sink.</p>
<p>Daniel also appreciated the contractor&#8217;s focus on design decisions like cabinet door orientation and space between features, freeing him up to get a few chef’s details exactly right. Daniel wanted to avoid putting the microwave in a prominent spot and was concerned about cleanliness in an above-stove location. It now lives on an open shelf underneath the counter, where it’s an accessible tool but not a visible feature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44784 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-08.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>

<h3>Custom kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p>The Sweeten contractor created a dedicated cabinet for cutting boards, and most pots and pans are found in pull-out sliding cabinets rather than stacked in drawers, so they take up less space but are still easily grabbed. A towel bar, mounted just below the counter by the sink, has become major real estate with S-hooks added for small items for hanging.</p>
<p>Daniel and Kate decided on marble hex tile for the floors. It brings a natural element of warmth with a shape that is familiar in homes of a similar era, and it bounces light from the kitchen window with a little glow. Color for the custom cabinets became a tortured decision. Daniel and Kate paid extra for additional cabinet samples when they found that paint swatches didn’t really help them envision different tones, and agreed on a navy finish that paired well with brass accents already in the home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44785" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44787" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A kitchen for cooks</h3>
<p>Daniel aimed for a real chef’s prep space with sections of cherry butcher block. It needs mineral oil but is otherwise not that hard to maintain with cutting boards regularly in the rotation. Around the sink, the couple chose a section of white quartz for easy maintenance and to protect the butcher block from water stains. Standard white subway tile adds a simple gleam and contrast between the cabinet lines.</p>
<p>Being avid cooks, Daniel and Kate really wanted to have appliances that could elevate their culinary skills. Key considerations for a new stove were powerful burner output and controls on the front of the oven; having the control panel on the back stand was too out of the way. Recipe experiments and heavy use mean that a food writer’s oven can get pretty gunky, so extra points for minimal nooks and grooves went to the stove they chose. The sink is an undermount with nice depth for lots of pots and pans, and the faucet is a simple gooseneck model with no side accents that might get in the way of a scrub down.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Nadia</i></span></p>
<h3>Keeping it together but separate</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The truth is we had a long list of desires when it came to buying our first home together. We wanted a house that was true to the time it was built, but clean and crisp and modernized. We bought it knowing that it needed a renovation, and as such lined up our contractor as we were finalizing the purchase. We wanted to start our renovation within a week of the closing and pay both mortgage and rent for no more than eight weeks. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44178 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg" alt="portrait, NYC, Brooklyn, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because Stephen’s mother was moving in with us, and she is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unable to manage stairs</a>, we needed a first-floor space for her. The house was a two-family home, with an upstairs apartment that was separate from the garden-level duplex. We decided to create a single-family house using the parlor level as entertaining space, allowing us to live separately, but together.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a background in interior design and Stephen has renovation experience, but this was for both of us our first construction project in New York City. Our vision was of a house that would feel contiguous </span><span class="s1">but not too chopped up and not sterile. To that end, we drew lines with a well-curated mix of surfaces, and the outcome is fantastic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg" alt="townhouse living room" width="1000" height="670" class="alignnone wp-image-44177 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Real hardwood floors</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house most needed a revamp on the garden and top floors along with proper bedrooms and a full-house fire/CO2 monitoring system. </span><span class="s2">Our plan was to tear out the existing fake-wood flooring on both levels and replace it with hardwood, and</span><span class="s1"> save the original floors on the parlor level</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">We chose a dark-wood flooring with a hand-scraped finish that was not ridiculously expensive. We needed it to hold up to kids, dogs, a walker, and it really has. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7.jpg" alt="Living room" width="1000" height="1493" class="alignnone wp-image-44176 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9.jpg" alt="dining room" width="1000" height="1478" class="alignnone wp-image-44163 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9-203x300.jpg 203w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9-600x887.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">On the garden level where my mother-in-law has her own ap</span></span><span class="s1"><span class="s1">artment, the foyer was updated with full marble slabs on the walls and floor. In the back,</span>the laundry room got a better egress to the backyard. Additionally, it functions as a mudroom with custom cabinetry and a pull-down drying rack where we can hang wet clothes. The bathroom received a simple replacement of fixtures and a coat of paint which changed it completely</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Storage in the kitchen</h3>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="663" class="alignnone wp-image-44166 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg" alt="kitchen seating area" width="1000" height="671" class="alignnone wp-image-44168 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The existing kitchen was L-shaped with very little counter space and a mobile dishwasher. As</span><span class="s1"> a big cooking family, we are very heavy users of the kitchen. By shifting the main k</span>itchen to one wall—including a dishwasher, wall oven, and a larger sink—it provided space for an island, a wrap-around pantry, and dining table.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44170 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry, kitchen pantry, wraparound pantry, kitchen, multigenerational kitchen, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds. Since it&#8217;s the other main kitchen wall, we could only fit 12&#8243;-15&#8243; deep cabinets. Instead of upper and lowers, we installed full-height 15&#8243; upper cabinets and are able to store an enormous amount of pantry and serving items. <span class="s1">The cabinet finishes are white and acacia and topped with a highly durable quartz surface including a big, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walk-around island</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg" alt="stairs" width="1000" height="1497" class="alignnone wp-image-44165 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">Heading up to the parlor floor, we removed the stair runner and painted the stair treads, risers, balusters, and spindles in one color. We used the black paint in a flat finish on the stair boards, and a pearl finish on the railings for extra luster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1.jpg" alt="kids bedroom" width="1000" height="672" class="alignnone wp-image-44162 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Specific bathroom features</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom gut reno on the top floor focused on creating a stand-up shower. Stephen and I travel a lot for work and have huge pet peeves. We wanted to turn on the water without getting wet and have a shelf or bench to put a foot upon or sit on. We chose a glass surround with a frameless structure to make the room feel as open as possible. The custom vanity is made of walnut, with four drawers that maximize countertop and storage space. It all fits nicely in a tiny-but-functional 5’ x 8’ bathroom space.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="walk in shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44179 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5.jpg" alt="bathroom open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44181 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We ended up skim coating almost the entire house, and our Sweeten contractor worked miracles on the original plaster that was uneven and had an unappealing, thick texture. <span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">It gave us a lot more understanding of how hard it really is to properly repair plaster so that it looks like new!</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="shower seat" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44180 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most difficult part of the renovation was the last six weeks, when we were living in the house, still under construction, with a three-year-old. Living in a space being renovated is challenging and exhausting, but our contractor staged the work so we could move in, and the crew became like family! It’s doable if you have fully functioning bathrooms and kitchen. Sweeten assisted throughout, from matching us with a contractor to providing a full bid review, and checking in about issues or concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end, we increased the scope of what we wanted to do significantly and our costs grew—but we got it all done in the</span><span class="s1"> range of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 to $150 per square foot</a>. Doing it simultaneously means that now we can enjoy our home and our time together as a multigenerational family. </span></p>

<p><em>Guest post by Westchester homeowner Brian McFarland</em></p>
<h3>The 14-year wait for a kitchen and bath renovation</h3>
<p>We spent nearly 14 years in our house before taking on this renovation. We had talked about it for years, and finally just grew too tired of trying to hold the existing kitchen and powder room together as parts kept failing or wearing out. Really, the kitchen was on Tracey’s list from the time we first made an offer on the house. The property is a 2,300-square-foot home constructed in 1920. It’s not very typical of any identifiable style, but if a realtor were listing it, they’d probably misidentify it as a Colonial.</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flow of the ground floor of our house was a mix of the original ‘20s layout and alterations made in the last 20 to 30 years. Circulation was difficult and space-consuming. Also, the prior kitchen alterations were done with materials that had now outlived their reasonable life cycle. It had always wanted to be re-done and now it finally would be.</p>
<h3>Finding a general contractor for their renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22786">posted our project</a> to Sweeten, we didn’t have a clear vision of a specific look or style—at least not a consensus. The focus was to simplify and yield more functional space. It was also important to create a working side of the eat-in area of the kitchen with storage and a pantry. We planned to keep the appliances but wanted new countertops, cabinets, floors, and backsplash. In an effort to improve flow, we also knocked down walls in a coat closet area and moved the powder room. Lastly, we planned to close up an exterior door that was never used. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We chose this Sweeten contractor</a> for the job with me doing the planning and sourcing of most of the materials, while Tracey handled most of the day-to-day communications with the contractor.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were most excited about getting rid of the ceramic tile floor. It really was evil. Every time we cleaned it, it got dirtier.</p></blockquote>
<h3>A rocky (but successful) start to the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The demolition was scheduled to begin on the first day of our summer vacation. We thought that the Village was going to permit that based on materials that had already been provided to them. We heard from our contractor that he needed signed-and-sealed drawings even to begin demolition. I served as the architect on our project and happened to be in Virginia Beach at the time. I really should have known better. Luckily, being the son of a fireman and a one-time Boy Scout, I’m always prepared for an architectural emergency. What architect worth his eyeglasses goes on vacation without his seal (and, yes, stamp pad) and an external drive with his current projects? After all, nowadays, you can architect from anywhere with an iPhone, Google Maps, and Kinko’s/FedEx.</p>

<h3>Planning the kitchen color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blue is Tracey’s favorite color. We went through the Benjamin Moore fan deck looking for blues and expected to do a custom color. It turned out that Omega’s blue stock color for the cabinets was very close to a paint color swatch that we had chosen. We were very pleased to be able to save extra time and money. Originally, Tracey said she was thinking white upper cabinets and blue lower cabinets with wood floors, but I wanted something more uniform. In the end, we chose blue cabinets for both the upper and lower cabinets, but with a white interior and glass fronts, so we each got a little of what we wanted.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the story behind the kitchen floor tile?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were most excited about getting rid of the ceramic tile floor. It really was evil. Every time we cleaned it, it got dirtier. We tried an exorcist but, apparently, they don’t do floors. It certainly didn’t help that it was more of a painted clay tile than a glazed ceramic tile. Underneath the thin beige-y surface coat was a red clay body, and the finished surface didn’t have anywhere near the tensile strength to overcome the flex in the floor that had been caused by some crude cuts made in the joists below in a prior alteration. Not only was the surface always dirty, but there were always red clay particles roaming around the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had fallen in love with a Porcelanosa tile pattern in blue shades. Tracey said she was surprised as it was completely outside the box of what she expected me to pick. She loved it—and now loves it even more because it doesn&#8217;t show any dirt, she says. We both love the new sink base with deep drawers, in lieu of cabinet doors. No more bending and fishing through the growing variety of cleaning supplies hiding deep in the back of the cabinet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> is Tracey’s favorite part of the renovation. Hands down. She’s so proud of it, she keeps the door open all the time. And I close it every time I go by.</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wallpaper-for-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powder room</a>, we went with a pocket door as a space-saving solution. We chose simple grey flooring, a compact modern sink, and a single hanging pendant. My favorite part of the renovation is the simplicity of the powder room with the glazed door, and the large window in it. Its remote location provides all the privacy it needs.</p>
<h3>Surviving the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Importantly, Sweeten helped us find the right contractor, especially by knowing when to suggest, “Maybe if you increase your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> a bit….” The recurring calls by account managers to monitor progress were welcome evidence that Sweeten maintained an interest in the project being delivered successfully. Our Sweeten contractor did just what he needed to do and treated the project as a business venture, whereas we behaved as if it was our home and we wanted it to be just right. He always knew when to suggest a solution to coax a decision, and retained a remarkably even temper throughout, even when we probably didn’t deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of advice to future renovators: decide EVERYTHING before you start. Trust me, there will be things you never even dreamed of, so the last thing you need is an outstanding to-do list when tradesmen are in your house, swinging tools, asking you new questions every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We feel our renovation was an even more dramatic change than we had expected. The whole flow of the house is better. Believe it or not, we see our teenagers more because the kitchen is now a pleasant, comfortable place where they sometimes linger for a few minutes before retreating back to their rooms. The only way I could be happier with it was if it was free!</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Tracey and Brian, for sharing your long-awaited renovation with us!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets are the building blocks of your kitchen; where you place them determines the layout of your space. Whether you love to cook or simply need a spot to store your snacks between Seamless meals, planning storage to meet your needs is a smart move. From <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semi-custom to fully customized</a> solutions, these five Sweeten homeowners took cabinet design to the next level.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27987 mb-0 size-chrono" title="cutting board drawer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tall, skinny drawer for storing cutting boards in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsley and Simon’s</a> custom kitchen island is easily accessible at an arm&#8217;s length away for meal prep or setting out cheese and crackers for guests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom18.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29013 mb-0 size-chrono" title="toe-kick drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom18.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by Martha Stewart, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this couple</a> added a toe-kick drawer beneath the lower line of custom cabinets in their Brooklyn kitchen, increasing the overall amount of storage space without altering the floor plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-gray-knob" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" alt="white kitchen cabinets with gray knob and silver appliance along with gray backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the many storage solutions in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-affordable-housing-co-op-hits-a-reno-lottery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate and Saul’s kitchen</a>, the couple installed Lazy Susan turntables within the corner cabinet to store large bowls and serving trays.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28648 mb-0 size-chrono" title="pull-out drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/convertible-one-bedroom-scores-big-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Blake</a> love to cook and entertain friends so these pull-out drawers nestled within the semi-custom cabinet are perfect for their collection of pots and pans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30729 mb-0 size-chrono" title="pull-out pantry rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>When an open-plan design shrunk the amount of available cabinet space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this homeowner</a> tucked a pantry into a spot alongside the fridge with a floor-to-ceiling pull-out rack, taking advantage of every inch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A loft apartment rediscovers its historic roots by exposing its beams, maximizing 11-foot ceilings, and bringing the walls down</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24990 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A tasteful and timely makeover for an 875-square-foot coop</h2>
<p>When a job necessitated a move from a Westchester suburb to New York City, Jessica and her husband, David, hoped for a move-in-ready apartment. Relocating is never simple, and undertaking a renovation was not in the plan. But when the search turned up an outdated (but otherwise perfect) Hudson Heights apartment with a show-stopping view of the George Washington Bridge, they knew it was time to find a contractor. See how the couple used artful ideas to maximize storage space, make room for guests, and enlarge a common living area.</p>
<p><span id="more-21812"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21814 size-feature" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-936x700.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07" width="936" height="700" /></span></p>
<p>Despite the beautiful bridge view, a renovation was in order: the 875-square-foot apartment was in a co-op building that had been built in 1917, and while parts of the unit had been updated since, Jessica and David had very specific ideas about how to make it work for their family. Some friends, wishing they had used Sweeten themselves, suggested that the duo try out the service. After consulting Sweeten’s<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/"> Renovation 101 series</a> and perusing the<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/"> Before &amp; Afters</a> to get a sense of the possibilities, Jessica<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7368"> posted their project</a> while the property went into contract. The plans called for the conversion of the dining room into a second bedroom, a completely reworked kitchen, refinished floors and moldings, as well as minor updates in the bathroom. Jessica set up site visits with her Sweeten matches, and ultimately decided on this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757">general contractor</a>, who, coincidentally, lived in the sister building next door. (Apparently, his own floor plan was so similar to Jessica and David’s, he told them that working on their place was “like what he always wanted to do to his own apartment!”) They liked that his was a design-build firm, which provides both interior design and general contracting services. As a &#8220;design-conscious builder,&#8221; he could assist them in making design decisions to achieve the bright and modern look they imagined.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21841 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/floorplan-1-723x755.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="755" /></p>
<p>First, they worked together to address the issues in the kitchen. Since the room faced another part of their building, it did not receive much natural light. An earlier attempt (by previous owners) at brightening the space had resulted in an “awful fluorescent yellow” paint on the walls, which clashed with the light tone of the existing wood cabinets and the orange tile on the floor. Aesthetics aside, the kitchen also did not provide enough functional storage: the only wall of cabinets also housed all the appliances. Inside one cabinet, an unmovable gas meter obstructed any usable space, and a steam riser in a corner wasted valuable square footage. The placement of the extra-wide doorway between the kitchen and the old dining room prevented the addition of a parallel wall of cabinets on the other side. And although the existing stove was in good shape, Jessica and David wanted to switch out the other appliances for energy-efficient alternatives.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21818 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-Before-During-01-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-Before-During-01-02" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>To create better flow and maximize function, the doorway to the living area was narrowed and moved to the side, making way for a full galley kitchen. A dropped ceiling was also raised to maximize vertical storage. All the appliances remained on the original bank of cabinets, so the (newly built) opposite side could be dedicated entirely to storage in the form of drawers, open shelving, a custom niche for spices, as well as a full-height pantry. In the corner where the steam riser stood, the contractor fabricated cabinet panels with a perforated insert to create a more uniform look. Now, the riser is hidden from view, but the narrow vertical space also serves as extra storage for cleaning supplies. Their Sweeten contractor created a similar solution for the gas meter, wrapping custom shelves around the meter so that the inside of the cabinet was not completely wasted. The couple’s desire for a “bright, clean look” was achieved with pure white shaker cabinets, recycled glass countertops in a light beige, and a white farmhouse sink. Jessica was especially excited about adding a scatter of color in the backsplash with Mexican tiles she sourced from Etsy. For the floor, cork tiles were chosen as a sustainable and renewable material that’s both soundproof and mildew-proof.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21823 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-03" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21825 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21822 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-01-02.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-01-02" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>Next, there came a change in plans. Although the intention was to create a guest bedroom out of the original dining room, Jessica and David quickly realized that they preferred to keep the space open for their own daily use. As a compromise, they built a closet against the new wall separating the dining room and kitchen. This way, a bedroom could be added down the line and it would already have its own closet. For now, they came up with a simple but genius solution for a flexible guest room: their contractor installed a pocket door between the living area and the kitchen, allowing visitors the option of transforming the entire living/dining room into a private suite.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21820 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-During-01-08-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-During-01-08 (1)" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p>Their general contractor went to work replacing the crumbly moldings and refinishing the worn floors in the new living area, made newly spacious by the removal of original walls that bracketed the formal dining room. Door moldings in the dining room were salvaged as replacement window trim for the living area. While making these repairs, he realized that there was empty space under each window ledge, which could be repurposed as built-in shelving. He also suggested painting the black window frames white to further brighten the space&#8211;a suggestion that Jessica loved. In addition, the couple requested new wooden beams on the ceiling for character—but it turns out they serve a dual purpose. There was a “step” in the ceiling, and the beams placed there helped to conceal the awkward transition where one part of the ceiling was higher than the other. Interestingly, numerous pieces of plywood were joined to fabricate the beam, which is actually hollow. This was both a greener and more affordable solution than procuring a solid piece of wood.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21828 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07 (1)" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>Although the renovation went smoothly for the most part, Jessica and David did run into a few challenges. First—and this is something we at Team Sweeten hear time and time again—they were held up by permits and approvals. To remove the dining room walls, they needed co-op board approval, which took about a month longer than they had anticipated. On another occasion, they were ordered to stop work for a day because of a misunderstanding about some wiring. The super had given the okay to cut old fabric-wrapped wires that were part of an obsolete intercom system, but it turned out that they connected a neighbor’s functioning phone lines! Thankfully, they were able to repair the lines and continue working the next day.</p>
<p>Jessica and David had never renovated in New York City before, and had dozens of questions when they started out. Now that they’ve lived to tell the tale, they have a couple pieces of advice to share with aspiring renovators: “Build in some extra time—everything takes longer than it should!” (That’s why renovators should always build in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/">at least two to six months for permits and approvals</a>.) Despite the lengthier-than-anticipated renovation, they are so happy to have a custom-built home that not only suits their every need, but is environmentally friendly and energy efficient to boot!</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Jessica and David, for sharing your beautiful new apartment with us!</p>
