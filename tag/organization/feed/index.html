										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>During COVID-19, certain renovation projects became even more important for homeowners</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44610 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg" alt="Image of the interior of a renovated Hamptons ranch home" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #76808f;">turns the garage into a living room</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take a hard look at our homes. Many were grateful for the security and comfort our homes offered. But many more made note of the features that their homes lacked. At a time when almost half of the workforce was working from home and schools relied on distance learning, renovation projects became top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the renovation mindset may be a little different going forward. Jean Brownhill, the founder and CEO of Sweeten discussed the current state of renovation on <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sweeten-founder-jean-brownhill-on-new-rules-renovation/id1520457603?i=1000504585856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Time</a>,</em> a podcast hosted by <em>Domino</em> editor-in-chief Jessica Romm Perez. One trend they discussed is the emergence of practicality and functionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s goal is to make their finished project picture perfect. But to actually live in the space, other things may be more important. Here are some top projects Sweeten saw grow in popularity over the last year.</span></p>
<h3>Top COVID-19 renovation projects</h3>
<h4>Creating new living areas</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With people spending so much time at home, they adapted their living spaces to new uses. Many people upgraded their outdoor living areas by adding outdoor kitchens and other living spaces. Also, it wasn&#8217;t clear if a vacation away would be possible, so outdoor living space became more important. It also makes it possible to socialize with others if indoor entertaining isn’t an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because health clubs and gyms were closed, many people looked for ways to squeeze a workout space into their living areas. People <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-modern-basement-renovation-produces-a-clean-slate-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapted spare rooms or unfinished areas</a> like basements to create home gyms. </span></p>
<h4>Kitchen and bathroom remodels still in the spotlight</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen and bathroom renovations are still popular. Although kitchens have always had many uses, their multitasking ability became more important during the pandemic. Kids often did their remote learning there, and adults used them for makeshift home offices. That&#8217;s in addition to the regular cooking, eating, and cleaning that goes on in a kitchen. The National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in addition to upgraded appliances, there was an increase in requests for easy-to-clean surfaces, video watching ability, and device charging stations in the cook space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bathrooms became personal sanctuaries more than ever before. After a few weeks that turned into months into the pandemic, people came to value self-care more than ever. Even those who had not considered bath renovations undertook them to improve on their self-care routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bath update trends include oversized showers that feature multiple spray heads and body sprays, as well as a steam option. Voice commands can activate preset water temperatures and start music from a personal playlist. Ventilation fans do more than removing moisture: some have LED lighting that helps prevent mold growth. Others feature multi-color lights to change the mood of the room. Many spa-like features can be controlled by smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most renovations had in common was ease of maintenance. You can renovate a space that looks great, but you have to live in it. &#8220;I think that is one reason why porcelain tiles and planks are so popular,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They are easy to clean and they can be made to look like any material. &#8220;</span></p>
<h4>Reworking existing spaces</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, we can relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our work habits. The typical household can get hectic with everyone vying for counter space where they can work, as well as computer time. The problem was frequently solved by setting up work and play areas throughout the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean mentioned the trend of installing temporary glass panels in the home. These solve the noise problem that happens when someone is on a video call while someone else is unloading the dishwasher, other people are having a conversation, and kids are running around playing. Panels and interior windows give people acoustic separation. &#8220;We’re not looking for visual separation, but what we do want, and need, is acoustic separation,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closet organizing system that lets you store things neatly and efficiently may be of more use than a room straight out of the pages of a magazine. &#8220;As someone doing a renovation, you don&#8217;t rise to the level of your goals so much as you fall to the level of the systems you put in place,&#8221; said Jean. While we usually want our homes to look fashionable, the emphasis for homes was on function for 2020. </span></p>
<h4>Using unused space</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As floor plans were reconfigured, any unused or underutilized areas became prime real estate. Guest bedrooms became home offices or study lounges. But the real stars were spaces like basements, attics, and garages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attics became playrooms for children. Basements were also used as play areas, but many were converted to home gyms. Some drywall and flooring, and maybe a little weatherproofing, turned these storage areas into useful living spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, such as Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people are adding ADUs</a>. An ADU is short for accessory dwelling unit. It is a new living space added to an existing building. Garages are being converted to home offices, but also studio apartments. The apartments can be rented out in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presents new reasons to think creatively about our living spaces. Although we hope the pandemic will stay a once-in-a-lifetime event, we can all take cues from these COVID-19 renovation projects to inspire our own spaces at home.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>

<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p>These kitchen pantry designs are just one aspect of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having a kitchen designed for stress-free cooking and entertaining</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible. The storage keeps their collection organized and within reach, making it easy to grab a book for a good read.</p>
<h3>Naturally divide a room (and show off your literary collection!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39593 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan kitchen space</a> feel harmonious can be challenging, especially when the adjoining space is a living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Russ</a> didn&#8217;t want to feel like they were always in their kitchen. To provide separation, they added a partial wall, which housed a customized, built-in bookshelf in their living room. To be complementary, their contractor built a frame for the bookshelf with a lacquer panel that matched the kitchen&#8217;s framing.</span></p>

			<h2>These closet renovations set up a tidy system, from shoes and clothes to kids’ toys</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16.jpg" alt="closet renovation with three doors in master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35239" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A closet renovation can be designed and built into life-changing organizational tools. With the help of a general contractor or designer, smaller closets can be combined to make one large one. In addition, rearranging a room’s layout may reveal underutilized floor space that transforms into storage. These Sweeten homeowners show how they tamed the clutter and simplified their everyday.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A wall-to-wall closet renovation regains space (and hides a TV!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43436" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Toby-closet-3.gif" alt="bedroom closet renovation with sliding doors and shoe storage" width="900" height="1350" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>W<span class="s1">ith a handful of design courses under his belt, </span><span class="s1">Toby put his passion for design to good use during his home renovation. He had given away the square footage of his bedroom closet to his bathroom located in the next room. To make up for this, he designed and built a new full-length closet for clothes and shoes with sliding doors. The built-in also hid a dresser and tv.</span></p>
<h3>Adding 3 custom closets for even <em>more</em> functional space</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38719" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2.jpg" alt="Kensington, renovation, closet" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">Storage was a big factor in Barbra and Sean’s apartment renovation. Closets went into one of the kids&#8217; rooms, the entryway, and the master bedroom (<em>pictured above</em>). In the master, their Sweeten contractor suggested <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining two smaller units</a> into a single large one with a custom organization system. </span><span class="s2">“There’s a lot more functional space now,” Barbra said. “I even have some halfway empty dresser drawers. I wish I had done all the closets. Someday!”</span></p>
<h3>A toy closet renovation keeps playthings neat—and out of sight</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37994" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, nursery closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">This Brooklyn homeowner chose a neutral palette for her son’s room; the better choice as a backdrop for all of his colorful toys. Even toy closets can offer a visual respite and functional organization. “</span><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/clinton-hill-experienced-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building out the closets</a> was essential to allowing us to settle in properly, and I’m glad we didn’t wait to do this (which was the original plan),” said the homeowner.</span></p>
<h3>Closets for extra shoe organization (87 pairs worth!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-02-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28034 size-chrono" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-02-04.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard closet build doesn’t give a lot of thought to shoe storage, so if you’re really into footwear, you’ll be faced with the problem of where to store them all. With 87 pairs of shoes in need of storage, Matthew had <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a custom closet designed</a> with pull-out drawers showing off a pop of orange. The drawers were each sized to his size 9 shoes and hidden behind a sleek panel door.</p>
<h3><strong>Walk-in bliss for a Brooklyn closet renovation </strong></h3>

<p>Combining two cramped, unlit closets into one cohesive unit topped the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-crown-heights-duo-takes-on-their-bathroom-and-closet-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation to-do list</a> for Kate and Max. They wanted to increase their overall storage space and add much-needed lighting so they could access their items more easily. Their Sweeten contractor removed a wall separating the two smaller closets, keeping the closet&#8217;s main access point in their bedroom.</p>
<h3><strong>Kids&#8217; bedroom closets keep family living room clutter-free </strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36113" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08.jpg" alt="closet organization" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">With two active little boys in an 800-square-foot junior one-bedroom co-op, Courtney and Jim’s main goal was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create more storage</a> in their sons’ room. They only requested one closet but their Sweeten contractor found space for a second closet in their room without sacrificing floor space. To keep their toys, sports items, and musical instruments from spilling into the common living areas, a thoughtful <span class="s1">organizational system was designed</span> in the existing closet.</p>
<h3><strong>Combining three small closets into two large custom units</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 size-chrono" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A layout change that resulted in opening the kitchen to the living room gave Marissa and Cody the opportunity to demolish the three narrow closets in the main living area and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build two larger ones</a>. By taking down the walls between the closets, the couple was able to increase their storage by making use of what was previously dead space between the walls.</p>
<h3><strong>A hideaway custom closet renovation mimics the luxury of a walk-in </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25188 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Michael and Chenta decided to overhaul the existing closet in their bedroom. They had a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large closet built</a> with simple, oak doors and added a floating wall in front of it. The wall separated their closet from the rest of the bedroom, giving it the feeling of a walk-in closet while still allowing the space between the wall and the closet to be used as a walkway.</p>
<h3><strong>An IKEA closet renovation with motion-sensor lights </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-20.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-35244 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35244 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-20.gif" alt="home renovation, closet renovation, built-in closets, organization" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe Maggie and Adam&#8217;s bedroom closets aren&#8217;t custom. For a made-to-order look, their Sweeten contractor<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> framed the IKEA closets</a> and installed LED lighting with motion sensors so the lights would turn on when the doors opened. The brass hardware gave a final refined touch, plus tied in with the hardware elsewhere in the home.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">It depends if you want to do a “DIY” closet renovation, or work with a seasoned pro. A simple ready-made, modular system for a small reach-in closet can cost under $200, plus installation. A tricked-out, customized walk-in can cost $4,000 or more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A New Jersey basement transforms into a spot for music, lounging, and laundry</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2015, Cristiana and her husband fell in love with a beautiful old house in New Jersey&#8217;s Bergen County. Original details from 1918 had been preserved, and</em> <em>the space was just right for the family of four. While the above-grade spaces were solid and charming, the basement needed some serious TLC. It featured outdated finishes from the 1970s, low ceilings (a big problem for Cristiana’s tall husband!), and a damp, musty feel. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cristiana knew that the valuable square footage could be turned into a family room, with space left over for wine and pantry storage as well as an updated laundry room. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found this contractor</a> to </em><em>convert an uninviting cave into a comfortable spot for the whole family.</em></p>
<p><em><img decoding="async" title="kids-playing-on-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48555 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Kids playing on the vinyl floor with toys after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Guest post by Bergen County, New Jersey, homeowner Cristiana</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years ago, we were moving from a 750-square-foot apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey, which felt like it was bursting at the seams. When we purchased our early Craftsman Colonial home, we knew there would be lots of work to do. But it felt solid, had the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms and great, livable space. Plus, the original unpainted chestnut moldings and leaded glass built-ins throughout the new house made any renovations that we needed to do seem bearable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-DURING.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="beige-carpeted-basement-blue-couch"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48543" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg" alt="Beige carpeted basement with blue couch and furniture before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

This meant demolishing the &#8217;70s-style finished basement. We weren’t that upset about losing the brown paneling, damp rug, and linoleum-tiled laundry room, and we were saving a lot of money by allowing the electrician free access to the walls and ceiling of the basement. The space had to be refurbished before it could be used for anything besides storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a couple of months of rewiring, patching, and painting, we temporarily relocated the toy storage and our TV to the enclosed front porch and began working with an architect to rethink the space. We came to Sweeten to find a contractor to execute our architect’s vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our plans included moving the laundry room to free up the main living area for toys, creating a craft area, and carving out a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine room</a>. An old phone booth left behind by the previous owners was relocated. We hoped to move as many pipes in the labyrinth hanging from the ceiling to provide more headroom for my 6’ 4” husband and our two future six-footers—our sons, currently ages six and eight. New windows were installed and additional waterproofing was added throughout the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Christiana_Basement-66-e1508331601201.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="gray-white-basement-recessed-shelves"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48553" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg" alt="Gray and white basement area with recessed shelves and view of handrail and banister after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="oak-vinyl-plank-flooring-basement"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48558" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg" alt="Oak vinyl plank flooring in white entertainment room after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we got started working with our Sweeten contractor, we tried to determine where waterproofing was necessary and figured out what pipes could be moved and what had to stay. We ran PEX pipes for water in the walls and were able to run all electricity through the ceiling. We had to leave our steam pipes for our original but completely functional heating system because it was cost-prohibitive to move them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our contractor also created easy access points for a (hopefully not so distant) kitchen renovation. In the end, the ceiling in the basement was raised from under six-and-a-half feet to over eight feet tall—a huge improvement and a crucial part of the renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the not-so-glamorous phases of waterproofing, plumbing, and electric were completed, we began to see the new rooms take shape. We were surprised by the space that needed to be left between the block walls and the drywall for fireproofing but decided to incorporate built-ins for board games as well as arts-and-crafts supplies. Our contractor also built a custom shelving unit under our TV to help prevent kids from walking into the corner of the TV when it was pulled out from the wall. The area under the stairs turned into a fort for the boys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the walls, we chose a warm gray paired with a soft white trim. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> are COREtec, which looks like walnut but is actually an engineered plank that’s perfect for below-grade spaces. This was one of our contractor’s best recommendations—a floating floor that is easily replaced if it gets wet, feels great underfoot, and looks amazing. We love it, and have gotten a ton of compliments on it!</p>

A wall-mounted drying rack is one of my favorite features. My kids and husband have turned the storage room into a music room, but as long as they don’t mind playing next to our second freezer and extra Cheerios, it works for me!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That’s about it for the first phase of our basement renovation. Of course, there are still items on the to-do list. We are planning to turn the wooden phone booth at the bottom of the stairs into a fun space for the boys<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it has working electricity, so we are hoping to wire it with wifi or as a charging station. We will also either paint it red (Londonesque) or blue (Doctor Who!), and add a plaque on the top with our last name. Next to the phone booth is a door that leads to our unfinished wine room, another project for the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For now, though, we love spending time in our new basement—and getting dedicated storage for the toys, drums, and storage off the main floor! It’s become a great family room for us to hang out in, and for the boys to play with their friends. Working with our Sweeten contractor was an amazing experience. He was cooperative, made great suggestions, and brought the project in on budget.</p>

<li><strong>Where: </strong>Sunnyside neighborhood, Queens, New York</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation: </strong>Remodel two bathrooms and transform the basement into a dual living and utility/storage space in a 1,200-square-foot single-family home</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Gordon</i></span></p>
<h3>A new start for an old home</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home, a brick townhouse in the Sunnyside Garden Historic District, was built in 1925 in one of the first planned communities inspired by the <span class="s2">English Garden Movement </span>in the United States. This enclave in the borough of Queens was originally developed to promote green space and community while providing affordable housing to working-class folks. Tracy, a financial analyst, and I, a teacher, had been living in the neighborhood for some time when we purchased the house, a former rental that hadn’t been improved since the early ‘90s. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/">We had a lot of ideas for updating it</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We felt lucky to find a three-story home of roughly 1,200 square feet, or 400 square feet per floor. The townhouse had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that was more than enough for the two of us, our cats, Laurel and Juniper, and our dog, Ballou. We wanted to gut-renovate both baths and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul our underutilized basement</a>. If we could squeeze in maximum function on every level, the house would feel more modern and bigger.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a landmarked townhouse</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/">renovated the kitchen</a> just after buying the house four years ago. The job, a mix of DIY projects and subcontractor commissions, was successful but laborious. We were recovered and ready to tackle the next phase, but understood that <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">the difficulty of the work would exceed our own abilities</a>, as would the red tape. Because we own a landmarked building, we would have to secure not only the expected Department of Buildings paperwork but also obtain Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) permits and approvals on all work impacting the building’s exterior. We knew our general contractor would assume much of this burden, which made us feel more comfortable diving in.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

<h3>Giving new life to the basement</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the whole renovation, the basement would be the larger piece, the goal was to increase the house’s usable space. Before we started, the basement was a large, unlevel room. Thanks to the old home’s process of settling, there was a two-inch difference in floor height from the walls to the room’s center. It had an outdated bathroom and poorly planned utility areas. A previous owner had installed an awkwardly placed cabinet and sink in the middle of the big room, and the washer and dryer next to the 40-year-old boiler, making laundry day a sweaty affair. The basement bathroom was dark and dank. We wanted to recreate the basement as a study, gaming/movie space, music center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/healing-home-space/">cat sanctuary</a> with storage, laundry, and a hospitable second bathroom.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42868 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg" alt="washer and dryer basement" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A Queens basement remodel to be livable</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started in the downstairs, where we first had to level the floor. We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/">The cost and challenge of doing a poured floor</a> just didn’t make it practical, and we were ultimately happy with an alternative that gave the room a similar feel at a lower cost. After losing two inches of headspace in the leveling of the floor, our Sweeten contractor suggested raising the ceiling by exposing and painting the heating pipe—easy, since they were replacing the room’s drywall, anyway. A new basement door, window, and vents for the bathroom and boiler room were installed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, they subdivided the space, creating a new living area, a storage room, and an expanded bathroom. LPC approvals, necessary for the new exterior basement door and window, as well as bathroom and laundry venting, went through smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42855 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg" alt="bathroom image after remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><em>(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; basement bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42851 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg" alt="concrete bathroom sink" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That leads me to the renovation’s second and equally important part: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/">the bathroom remodels</a>. The basement bath would get a complete gut job to remove a creepy stall shower, and an expansion to make room for a freestanding bathtub. The windowless downstairs bathroom needed to be bright and clean. We went for a spare look, choosing large wall tiles, a custom concrete sink, and a wall-hung toilet, in addition to the beautiful bathtub. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">A tub-turned-shower for the master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our upstairs bath would also be gutted and refreshed, with a glass-walled shower replacing the old tub-and-shower setup. We couldn’t make the</span><span class="s3"> 30-square-foot room bigger, </span><span class="s1">but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/">we could up its storage and functionality</a>. Upstairs, we went for a modern toilet and a compact, wall-mount sink, along with a recessed medicine cabinet, and toothbrush niche. We installed rectangular wall tiles vertically for a playful effect. Both baths got recessed lighting.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><em><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42840 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="black hexagon bathroom floor tile, clear shower doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; upstairs bathroom</span></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was finally time to finish the basement, we were excited to be able to install the shelving system ourselves; the contractor made it easy by mounting wood blocking between the wall studs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">We wanted built-ins</a>, but the wall-shelving was more cost-effective and looks great. We offset neutral surfaces with books, wood accents, and colorful velvet furnishings. One takeaway we agree on: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Don’t cheap out on hardware</a>; the difference shows as it wears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only downside, in the end, was that the price of the project came in much more than we anticipated after we had to replace the boiler and a rotted drainpipe. Once we finalized the task list, though, our Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget. Doubling our living space has had such an impact on our daily life. We don’t have a single regret!</span></p>

<h3>From Manhattan to a tighter-knit neighborhood</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of events, including a new job, took Anita from Manhattan’s Chelsea to a co-op in Jackson Heights. “I wanted to live somewhere where I felt part of a community and that my connections could really make a difference. I also left the private sector for the nonprofit world,” she shared. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new 850-square-foot apartment in a 1950s building was the right fit for her reimagined life—minus the kitchen. “I knew I’d gut renovate the kitchen the second I saw it,” Anita said. She’d been living simply (with just a bed and kitchen table) in the apartment for three months when she embarked on her first renovation. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he project was posted to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sweeten and was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a selection of vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Queens</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3>A white and wood kitchen for gathering</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita’s mission for the bland and dated space? To create a warm and modern room with plenty of storage and room to host friends. There were no outlets along the entire counter wall either, so updating the electrical panel was essential.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57114 size-full" title="white-and-wood-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Two-tone white and wood kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-57115 size-full" title="wood-cabinets-and-floating-shelf" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="kitchen with white walls and natural wood cabinets and floating shelf and stainless steel appliances and floor tiling after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita used Ikea’s kitchen planning tool, working with an Ikea designer to measure the kitchen and select all of the materials she needed to order. Pairing a simple contrast of colors, this combination offered an interesting spin on traditional design for added visual appeal. The dual finishes even carried over into the drawer-within-drawer system for a coordinated look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her years spent living in Germany (where she says everyone renovates kitchens, even in rentals) inspired the appliance choices, as did prior work experience. “I had also worked in refrigeration for vaccines in developing countries and know way too much about refrigerators,” Anita said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking out kitchen floor tile proved to be a more difficult decision. Her contractor recommended a supplier in Queens where, after several trips, she found a cement-look tile made in Italy.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57124 size-full" title="pull-out-cabinet-drawers-and-floating-shelf" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kithen-02.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>The right contractor is in sync with their client</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, Anita worried most about timing, budget, and working with a professional she could trust. Her Sweeten contractor delivered on all three, offering a reasonable estimate based on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a>, a clear timeline from the get-go, and following through during the project. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M46pF7SpsME" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My contractor sent me to reputable places priced within my budget that had items in stock. So, I didn&#8217;t have to rely on catalog pictures or internet images. He also respected my budget but knew when to push me toward better quality items or when simpler materials would suffice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One of his best traits was being really good at reading people. He knew when my freaking out was legitimate and when I was falling into a trap of keeping up with the next big trend.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractor’s team was also respectful of the building, taking the right precautions and cleaning up every day. Anita said her building super still compliments them on their professionalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, she has a brand new kitchen, where she can throw “kitchen parties,” sip wine, and just enjoy the space.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Give a generic Jersey City kitchen a modern-industrial twist</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every kitchen in a pencil-factory-turned-apartment complex in Jersey City, New Jersey, had the same look: brown cabinets, tan tiles, and black countertops. But homeowners Becky and Paul (and their two cats), who’d been living in their two-bedroom apartment almost three years, wanted their cook space to stand out. Their 120-square-foot galley kitchen had a workable layout and thanks to a look-through window, was also connected to the living space. It just needed a refresh of the fixtures and materials, plus more storage. The couple </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40861" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The first-time renovators got to work with their general contractor to select materials and appliances.  “If we chose something he thought from a professional standpoint wouldn’t work, he would not only explain why but have alternative options for us to review,” they shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were aiming for a bright and airy look with touches of industrial elements to align with their building style, which they achieved with white cabinets, a glossy backsplash, and pops of stainless steel in the faucet and farmhouse sink. The blue wall makes the room appear bigger and lighter, too.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40867 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="653" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-300x196.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood-like tile floor (a growing trend in kitchen upgrades), floating wood shelves, and a corner of butcher block countertop add a natural appeal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the kitchen’s coolest new features: a built-in wine rack just above the sink that takes advantage of what would otherwise be empty space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong communication between the contractor and homeowners contributed to the successful completion of the project. If issues cropped up, like delayed deliveries, that would affect timing or cost, the contractor contacted the homeowners right away and found solutions quickly. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a newbie in renovation, this level of communication and education was greatly appreciated. He was also such a champion for us when ordering materials and always put his clients&#8217; needs first when working with vendors,” they shared. The renovators didn’t run into any major issues, though their friendly cats did try to lend a paw throughout the process. On workdays, Becky and Paul set them up in their bedroom to keep them out of the construction zone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten Client Services also just checked in throughout the project to make sure the process was going smoothly. “We could not be more grateful to have such a terrific support system,&#8221; they shared.</span></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Improve the layout and look of a drab Jersey City kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Anne wanted to wait to move into her Jersey City co-op apartment until she renovated the kitchen. After six years of renting, she bought the apartment knowing it would need some work. “I saw 35 finished apartments that just were not ‘me,’ so I was very open to the idea of purchasing a place that needed a little work to make it my own,” she said. Having grown up with a family very comfortable with renovations, Anne was more than ready to take on a project. On her wish list?

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: In order to make the best use of the small space, a wall with a cut-out into the living room (and that housed appliances) came down. Knocking it down allowed more light to come into the living room from the window over the sink. Otherwise, the footprint remained the same, with the kitchen sink and dishwasher on one wall, the stove on another.</p>
<p>The builder-grade cabinets were swapped with white shaker cabinets, adding the traditional touch Anne was aiming for. “I picked tall cabinets that went all the way up to the ceiling, and my contractor installed trim at the top to make them look custom,” she said. A classic subway tile backsplash and quartz countertops tied the whole look together. New hardwood flooring in both the kitchen and living area united the space.</p>
<p>A few roadblocks came up during the project, such as outdated electrical and plumbing, but Anne’s contractor handled it all—without delaying the estimated completion time. “The biggest thing that was important for me was to have a timeline that worked. My rental lease was up and I needed a place to live,” she said. Anne was able to move in right on time and start enjoying her new kitchen. Selecting the new cabinets and counters was her favorite part of the process, as was seeing it come together over the weeks of renovation. “It’s extremely rewarding to see how great everything turned out and having your own space that is exactly how you would want it!&#8221;</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Add more storage and bring a kitchen up to date</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Kate and Matt loved Jersey City and their home, but were more than ready to refresh their kitchen. Cheap ‘80s-era cabinets were showing their age and the storage situation was dire. The galley set-up also limited their options to expand and create a more cook-friendly space. Kate’s main ask, besides a completely new look, was a breakfast bar. “I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,” she said, “so I really craved a little spot in which to sit.” <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19777">She posted her project on Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3189">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-white-countertop"  class="alignnone wp-image-30957 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg" alt="beige kitchen cabinets and white countertop in a kitchen with brown floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Luckily, the galley layout proved less of an obstacle than anticipated. She worked with her Sweeten contractor, settling on a built-in breakfast bar at the far end of the kitchen, just above the stairs. The couple worried about the potential for things to fall of the ledge to the floor below, but their contractor&#8217;s recommendation of a raised back on the bar eliminated their concern.</p>
<p>The good fortune continued, as they discovered during demolition the soffits that were taking up valuable wall space were empty. They were removed, and taller upper cabinets installed. To make the galley kitchen feel brighter, the couple chose light materials for the countertops and backsplash to counteract the new gray cabinets.  Their contractor also moved the refrigerator and dishwasher, optimizing the layout for more storage options.</p>

<h3>Storage space with a Japanese vibe</h3>
<p>Joseph, an immigration lawyer and painter, and Sunghee, a curator and former director of Art Space Pool, a non-profit art space in South Korea, rented their mid-century Clinton Hill co-op in Brooklyn for several years before purchasing it from the owner. They were lucky the 606-square-foot apartment had been modernized before they moved in with new white oak floors, kitchen upgrades, and bath updates with Ikea products. When it became their own, they wanted the home to reflect their modern Japanese aesthetic and to have additional storage space.</p>
<div></div>
<p>They turned to architect Brett Masterson of <a href="https://masterson.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masterson Architecture &amp; Design Co.</a>, who had renovated his own one-bedroom in their building. They were impressed by how he had maximized his even smaller space and created custom storage solutions that disappeared when not in use.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37005 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-01.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Integrating lifestyle and function</h3>
<p>The couple’s main objective for the 44-square-foot area was to open up the closed-off kitchen to the rest of the apartment and, ideally, double their storage space. The marriage of the Japanese aesthetic—minimal hardware, natural and warm materials—with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/7-kitchen-storage-solutions-small-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clever organizational solutions</a> drove their vision. &#8220;The project was like a renovation version of author Marie Kondo’s <a href="https://konmari.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KonMari Method</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for tidying up,&#8221; the architect said.</p>
<p>Brett spent a lot of time understanding how the couple used the space: their lifestyle patterns, what they had for breakfast, and how they spent their evenings. He wanted the renovation to adapt to Sunghee and Joseph&#8217;s routines, while also streamlining their day-to-day through purposeful design and space planning.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37016 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Built-ins and organizational systems</h3>
<p>They faced challenges right away: First, it took a long time for the co-op board to approve the project. Then, the co-op board wouldn&#8217;t allow the wall where the electrical panel and intercom were located to be removed. That limited how open they could make the kitchen on one side. They still were able to open the wall that faced the large living room windows, which meant they could have a direct sightline to the outdoors and add to the open feel. They also flipped the electrical panel to the inside of the kitchen so it wasn’t as visible. A base cabinet at the wall’s cut-out that Brett calls “the landing strip” is a place to kick off shoes, store keys, wallets, etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37011 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The small kitchen didn&#8217;t have enough working space for two people to comfortably prepare a meal together. The compact fridge took up a quarter of the kitchen, so they relocated it to a new adjacent storage wall across the entry hallway. That was a game-changer since it increased the amount of prep space by 200 percent.</p>
<p>The existing storage situation also made the room feel cluttered as well. The couple was storing things in the space between the tops of the cabinets and the ceiling and were keeping things out on the counter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37012 size-full" title="utensil storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Utilitarian needs and modern looks</h3>
<p>The architect placed a pegboard panel on the outside face of a six-inch deep cabinet (used as a pantry to hold mason jars and cooking ingredients). The board, which holds regularly used items such as a knife block, cooking utensils, a basket of onions, cast iron pans, is only visible when someone is standing by the stove. After things are washed, items can be hung to dry, which skips a stop at the drying rack and helps eliminate clutter. They also separated the cooktop and oven so cooking and baking could be done at the same time—a benefit they were not expecting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-37540 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-14.gif" alt="hidden, refrigerator, kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>The most important part of the storage solution design was the wall of book-matched white oak cabinets in the entryway. The cabinets look the same from the outside, but each was designed for a specific need: Cabinet one is an entry storage wall with space for shoes, vacuum, dustbin, and microwave; Cabinet two is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel-ready refrigerator</a>; Cabinets three and four are a double-door unit that houses a modular ELFA shelving system that Joseph and Sunghee already owned.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37566 mb-0 size-chrono" title="storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-14-1.gif" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen, 44 square foot kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Brett also discovered an unused pocket behind the cabinet wall where they were able to hide a cabinet that is flush with (and blends into) the sheetrock wall. The cabinet opens on the living room side and houses the couple’s luggage for easy access since Sunghee travels to Korea regularly.</p>
<h3>A limited and complementary palette</h3>
<p>A limited materials palette helped unify the renovated kitchen with the rest of the apartment and complemented the couple’s furniture and art collection. They primarily used rift-cut white oak for the cabinets and shelving because the flooring, dining table, and bench were white oak. They also chose to paint all the upper cabinets white to lighten the mass of storage cabinets above the sink and blend into the wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37017 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13.jpg" alt="portrait, homeowner" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Sweeten homeowner, Joseph</span></p>
<p>Brett, Sunghee, and Joseph are all pleased with the way things turned out. The architect had shown the couple plans in 3D to help them visualize how their kitchen would meet their needs and look the way they wanted it to. Ultimately they created “a spot for everything they needed and nothing they didn’t,” he said.</p>
<p>They enjoyed selecting lighting and tiles, and Sunghee, in particular, loved seeing the contractor work. (She felt like she was apprenticing at times because she spent so much time watching the construction team.) The architect says that he was excited to try some new, well-made high-end materials, such as Heath ceramic handmade floor tiles (set in a herringbone pattern) and custom lighting.</p>
<h3>Architectural experience</h3>
<p>While this project was a first for Sunghee and Joseph, Brett has renovated more than 20 homes (three of them his own). He offers this advice: “Be prepared to spend 20 percent more and for projects to take 20 percent longer, and don&#8217;t live in the space while work is being done.” But it’s not all cautionary. “You can splurge on nice things in small spaces without too much of a financial impact on the project.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Sunghee, Joseph, and Brett for sharing this beautiful—and smart—space!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 6 smart solutions for bathroom storage help decrease clutter and increase space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small bathroom can be home to a large amount of storage space. The key is to get creative and use every nook and cranny you have to help store your essentials. Carefully plotting the layout and layering in key features like the Sweeten renovations below can help maximize space and minimize clutter—making a beautiful and functional bathroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>

Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor installed a recessed wall unit behind the door, creating almost-hidden additional storage.</p>

Here, she is able to store extra towels and other toiletries.</p>

They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity. Plus, the six inches of space behind the shower wall allowed the couple to add double-storage niches.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22105 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="Recessed cabinet in bathroom for extra storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren and Ross</a>, their bathroom was in need of a major overhaul. They wanted a hotel-inspired vibe that included more storage. So they had custom a shower niche put in as well as a large in-wall cabinet—perfect for hiding toiletries and other essentials.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40140 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13.jpg" alt="freestanding blue bathroom cabinet for storage" width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A freestanding storage cabinet has the look of a built-in in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-bedroom-conversion-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine and Chris</a> renovated bathroom. The blue-stained ash wood matches the sink vanity.</p>

They upgraded it with double mirrors, featuring storage ledges for a more modern storage interpretation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Take notes from these Sweeten renovators, who expertly renovated their homes to get studio apartment storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a studio apartment, closet and storage space is scarce. Your only options for keeping everything in your home are being surrounded by your stuff 24/7 or adopting a minimalist lifestyle and ditching most of your belongings. Neither are perfect solutions. Instead, reimagine the closet, not as a single space where you keep everything, but as multiple spaces throughout your home. Take inspiration from five resourceful renovators who came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors—and see where things can go in a small space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24842 size-chrono" title="bedroom built-in" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>A low cabinet wall can replace closet space for studios</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A low wall of cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew&#8217;s bedroom</a> is the perfect storage alternative to the missing closet, providing ample clothing and shoe storage. Aligning the top of the built-in with the lower half of the window not only keeps it from making the room feel smaller but—<em>voilà!</em>—he now has a window seat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Kitchen cabinetry on a blank wall creates a pseudo pantry &amp; fridge space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Square footage was limited in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren’s tiny kitchen</a>, so she took a blank wall and loaded it up with storage for a hidden pantry and fridge—plus, a coat closet! Tucking everything out of sight provides an uncluttered and sophisticated look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30499 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30500 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Custom wall-hung cabinetry instead of a closet? Yes, please!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of closets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Ian’s studio</a> meant that they had to get creative when it came to clothing storage. A custom walnut cabinet in the bedroom area with a mahogany finish takes advantage of empty wall space and adds some visual interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30000 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30002 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Sleek storage in the living area expertly blends in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ying’s studio</a>, she took the average closet build and turned it inside out, adding cabinet storage, shelving, and drawers along the perimeter of the main living area.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26644 size-chrono" title="custom sliding wardrobe" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A sliding door that doubles as cleverly hidden clothing storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel’s bedroom</a> had a new entryway, but no closet space whatsoever, so he designed a custom sliding door that doubled as wardrobe storage.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turning a leaky bathroom into a modern space in Harlem</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The condo Jen and Luke purchased two years ago was in move-in condition. It had everything they needed, including the extras—central air, washer and dryer, dishwasher, ice maker, and garbage disposal. But, as it turned out, it also had a poorly laid-out bathroom that caused them nightmares. They had an interior architect friend who helped with the design, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gray-marble-bathroom-with-shower-head" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49106 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Gray marble bathroom with shower head and wall fixtures before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a decade, Jen, a senior managing director of a residential real estate firm in Manhattan, and Luke, who works in IT for a women’s fashion and accessory house, had been subletting an apartment. When the owner decided to sell, they searched close to their neighborhood and found a 948-square-foot apartment in an 1892 factory building that had been converted to condos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom was the one dark spot on their otherwise sunny horizon. Apparently, there was a leak in the shower pan, which was causing the light gray marble floor to turn brown, yellow, and pink. “When we purchased the apartment, we didn’t realize that the shower was previously repaired for a leak,” Luke said. “But the repair hadn’t addressed the cause of the leak, which was the shower pan itself. We took this as a sign to renovate our bathroom.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: They contacted their friend and interior architect Irene Kang. “We could not have done this without her help,” Luke said. Kang suggested a minimalist design “with cool colors that maximized the space and had a lot of storage.” As a real estate professional, Jen used her expertise as well. “Bathrooms are personal,” she said. “Sometimes apartments don’t sell due to bathrooms since they are one of the most expensive rooms to renovate.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They decided to go with neutral colors and plan to hang art to make the space personal. Aside from the shower pan issue, they needed more storage space. Irene suggested <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large cabinets</a> inset into a wall shared with the master bedroom closet. “I knew that there were approximately four to five inches of space on the interior of the drywall,” Luke said. “Knowing this and the depth of the cabinets, I was able to figure out that they would stick out only four to five inches into the bathroom itself, which would not get in the way.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Luke-Miller-Bathroom05.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-black-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49107 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black floor tiles and floating vanity and vanity mirror and shower niche after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="large-storage-wall-insert-cabinet" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49108 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-05.gif" alt="Large storage cabinets inserted into wall with white pocket door after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, they weren’t sure where they could find something that would meet their needs. They found themselves at the Kohler Experience Center in Manhattan. “We described our idea, and Caroline [Hughes, their sales rep] suggested looking at the Robern line of cabinets,&#8221; Luke said. &#8220;We did, and that was it.” Now two cabinets measuring 70” tall x 15” wide and 8” deep sit side by side. “They were expensive, but worth it,” he said. In the end, their Sweeten contractor just had to frame it out and cut out a wall stud. “It was simple,” Luke said. To add to the storage, the contractor created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/shower-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shower niche</a>, while the size of the vanity increased from 36” to 60” wide.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="glass-door-for-shower-niche" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49110 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="Glass door for the shower niche with beige wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between Irene, the Sweeten contractor, and Caroline, “we had lots of help with design decisions,” Luke said. “We made all of our selections, including tiles and fixtures, in one afternoon.&#8221; Jen adds, &#8220;The prices were reasonable and they can help you get non-Kohler items too. They made it super easy.” Their favorite finds are the medicine cabinet above the sink and the LED mirrors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge was living in their apartment <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the renovation</a>. “We have a one-bedroom, two-bath space and the master bath was undergoing the renovation,” Luke said. “We were subject to mold, mildew, and construction dust, despite the best efforts of the contractor to keep everything clean. He did a superb job of keeping our space livable, but some things you cannot escape unless you have a ventilation system.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-wall-tiles-white-grouting" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49111 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom wall tiles with white grouting and a recessed shower shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor focused on small details too, such as selecting the threshold saddle for the shower and hiding the tile edges with aluminum molding. “He helped with the design and function every step of the way,” said Luke. “Sweeten was in constant contact in case we needed help,&#8221; said Jen. &#8220;Since Luke has project management experience and has worked in furniture factories, we didn’t require the attention that others might. But it was comforting to know they were there when needed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the support is what gave them the bathroom that they envisioned. “You’ve really got to listen to your designers, the store people, and your contractor,” Jen said. “Don’t be afraid to tell people what you want, but if they offer an opinion, listen. The client is always right and they will do what you want, but they know what will look good in years to come.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets are the building blocks of your kitchen; where you place them determines the layout of your space. Whether you love to cook or simply need a spot to store your snacks between Seamless meals, planning storage to meet your needs is a smart move. From <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semi-custom to fully customized</a> solutions, these five Sweeten homeowners took cabinet design to the next level.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27987 mb-0 size-chrono" title="cutting board drawer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tall, skinny drawer for storing cutting boards in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsley and Simon’s</a> custom kitchen island is easily accessible at an arm&#8217;s length away for meal prep or setting out cheese and crackers for guests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom18.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29013 mb-0 size-chrono" title="toe-kick drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom18.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by Martha Stewart, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this couple</a> added a toe-kick drawer beneath the lower line of custom cabinets in their Brooklyn kitchen, increasing the overall amount of storage space without altering the floor plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-gray-knob" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" alt="white kitchen cabinets with gray knob and silver appliance along with gray backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the many storage solutions in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-affordable-housing-co-op-hits-a-reno-lottery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate and Saul’s kitchen</a>, the couple installed Lazy Susan turntables within the corner cabinet to store large bowls and serving trays.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28648 mb-0 size-chrono" title="pull-out drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/convertible-one-bedroom-scores-big-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Blake</a> love to cook and entertain friends so these pull-out drawers nestled within the semi-custom cabinet are perfect for their collection of pots and pans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30729 mb-0 size-chrono" title="pull-out pantry rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12.gif" alt="kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>When an open-plan design shrunk the amount of available cabinet space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this homeowner</a> tucked a pantry into a spot alongside the fridge with a floor-to-ceiling pull-out rack, taking advantage of every inch.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A Brooklyn remodel adds bathroom storage &amp; square footage</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Sari, a post producer for television commercials, bought a one-bedroom condo in a 45-unit building in the Crown Heights/Prospect Heights neighborhood four years ago. She loved the location and feel of the apartment as soon as she walked inside. There were plenty of closets and storage spaces, she said, but “it was mind-blowing to me that there was no storage at all in the bathrooms. &#8220;Who designs a bathroom with no storage space? Crazy, right?” And despite it being built in the aughts (in 2006), the floor tiles and lighting were tired and the large entry door took up a lot of wall real estate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-pedestal-sink-near-toilet"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49114 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White pedestal sink near toilet and large vanity mirror in a brown tiled bathroom before and during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Sari envisioned changing the whole layout, expanding the bathroom into her walk-in closet and creating a clean, modern monochromatic space. “I had no idea of how to start,” she said. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. She learned that she wasn’t going to be able to relocate the toilet, so she decided to just keep the original layout and focus on creating a “beautiful and functional space” with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lots of storage</a> in the form of a two-drawer vanity, vanity mirror, and open shelving. The most exciting change? “Radiant floors, which are heaven,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-white-subway-tiles"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49115 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White bathroom with white subway tiles and glass doors to a walk in shower and floating vanity and sink after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-white-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49116 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="White bathroom with white sink and vanity mirror along with bathroom vanity and open wall shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sari loves to watch “Fixer Upper” and other home renovation shows. That’s where she got the idea of a pocket door “so I could use the wall space that had been covered up by the original bathroom door.” It&#8217;s a perfect place for a towel bar and hooks. “It makes the room feel much larger,” she said, “especially because the door is rarely closed,” since she lives alone with her pitbull Bruno.</p>
<p>Once the work began, Sari’s Sweeten contractor gutted the bathroom and found leaks coming from neighbors’ apartments above and next door. “That wasn’t fun and a bit stressful,” she said, “but building management fixed them, so we only lost one day during the renovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="vanity-drawers-under-white-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49118 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-14.gif" alt="Vanity drawers under white sink and black floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge was finding the tiles. “It was overwhelming and took me over a month,” said Sari, who originally wanted to do a black and white bathroom, but then decided to keep the color scheme in line with the apartment in case this is the only renovation she does. “I had no idea where to go or how to start, but my contractor was very helpful.” He told her where to purchase tile and granite, as well as wood for shelving. Then he picked up everything for her since, she said, “I’m a New Yorker and don’t have a car!” She also found it helpful to contact Sweeten’s client services, which answered her questions and directed her to their partner Build.com, where she purchased most of her fixtures. (“My sales representative there was terrific,” Sari said.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="glass-door-to-white-walk-in-shower"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49119 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-13.gif" alt="Glass door to a white walk in shower with beveled subway tiles and built in shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="white-beveled-subway-tiles-in-walk-in-shower"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49120 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="White beveled subway tiles in walk in shower with glass doors and large nickel shower head after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: With her first remodeling project behind her, she has a few tips for those starting a bathroom remodel: make note of where your towel bars are and where they should be so that they are at a comfortable height. (Also, make sure you know which side of the toilet you want your flusher to be located, because you can’t change that!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How a modular closet renovation by Sweeten brought this Upper East Side couple organizational harmony</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jacob-Closet.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31035 mb-0 size-chrono" title="work-in-progress-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jacob-Closet.gif" alt="work in progress in room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When software developer Jacob first purchased his one-bedroom co-op apartment, located on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, in 2017, there were two small closets that he knew could be combined to create a larger, more functional modular closet for himself and his girlfriend, Morgane. As part of an overall refresh of the home, he walks us through the process of how he tackled this aspect of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt_Before01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30826 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt_Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30827 size-chrono" title="bedroom closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30828 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt08-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt08" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />(Above) Jacob&#8217;s bedroom closet that combines hanging space with shelves and shoe storage</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you decide on the Container Store&#8217;s Elfa System? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> I looked at some of the other options out there but based on my budget and the size of the space, <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/elfa/index.htm#?apos=MB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elfa</a> clearly made the most sense. Also, we had reached a point where the renovation was done, and within two weeks, Morgane and I would be sharing the space almost every weekend, so getting a functioning closet in quickly was a high priority.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Did you design the closet yourself using the online tool or did a representative help you in the store?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> A rep helped in the store, and everyone there was super helpful. Make sure to do a good job of measuring the space ahead of time! Once they know the dimensions, they will ask you several questions about your usage plans for the closet, your wardrobe, etc. After 20 minutes, they have a prototype to make adjustments to, although the initial blueprint was very close to the final design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30935 size-chrono" title="closet rendering" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-1-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30936 size-chrono" title="closet blueprint" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-2-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Jacob&#8217;s closet blueprints</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you decide what mix of elements to include (hanging space, open shelving, drawers, etc.)? </em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> The plan was to create a split usage space for me and Morgane. We would each get two hanging sections and two sets of shelves, and we would share a large section for shoes. One of Morgane&#8217;s hanging sections is double-height for hanging longer items. We have an enormous dresser in the bedroom, so we were able to consider the closet as a space almost exclusively for hanging and shelving.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What did your contractor do to prepare the space for the installation?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten contractor</a> demo&#8217;ed and combined the existing closets. He also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished the floors</a> and walls of the combined space. He left the space open without doors. We used the installer provided by the Container Store’s delivery contractor. It took just a few hours.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Why did you decide to leave the doors off?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> Before, the closet existed as two extremely small separate closets. When combined, the opening was a non-standard width for pretty much every manufacturer we looked at. There is not enough space to the side for a sliding barn door or a pocket door, and Morgane and I both find French doors or folding doors annoying to deal with. Leaving the doors off of the closet actually gave us a lot more flexibility in gaining maximum closet space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30830" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt10" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>

<p>You can see Jacob’s project profile <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20401#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and if you’re considering a fully customized built-in closet, take a look at this <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost guide</a>.</p>
<p><em>As he pointed out, there are many modular closet options out there in addition to <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/elfa/index.htm#?apos=MB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elfa</a>. California Closets is a popular one at a slightly higher price point than Elfa, while <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Storage-Organization/N-5yc1vZc1x1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,<a href="https://www.lowes.com/c/Closet-organization-Storage-organization">Lowe’s</a>, and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a> all have modular closet kits that you can customize to your liking. They are all priced per piece, so you’ll have to buy each shelf, bracket, and track separately.

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30234 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For 18 years, home for JoAnn and Brian was a 6-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot Colonial in Chesterfield, New Jersey. As they neared retirement, however, they decided that they wanted to move to Manhattan—a lifelong desire. Their daughter was living in New York City, and the couple already owned an investment property in the Turtle Bay neighborhood that could be converted to their primary residence. The apartment, a one-bedroom co-op measuring 600 square feet, had been rented out for over a decade.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30237 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30236 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bath and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was tired and worn, and “totally not my style,” says JoAnn. “The kitchen was completely outdated and ugly. I like to cook and wanted more storage and a larger work area. I needed room for all my appliances and a large countertop for prepping. We didn’t add more appliances, though, just bought new and better-quality ones.” The kitchen was walled off from the living area and the entryway with narrowly-arched pass-throughs, which made the space feel smaller than it actually was. The plan for the bathroom, which required a refresh, was to swap out the tub for a large walk-in shower. Storage was to be incorporated throughout the home wherever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30240 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30241" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As experienced renovators (with four renovations under their belts!), JoAnn and Brian knew it would be beneficial to hire a licensed contractor who was experienced with local rules and regulations. Since their contacts were all in New Jersey, they were at a loss for where to turn. Then, one day while they were watching the Sunday morning news, they saw a commercial for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. “We immediately <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filled out the easy online form</a> and were matched with three different contractors. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After meeting our Sweeten contractor</a>, we knew right away we wanted to work with him. This turned out to be our best decision!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo got to work on a design with their contractor that would allow them to downsize comfortably from a six-bedroom house to a one-bedroom apartment (no easy feat). Their biggest concern was storage. Their Sweeten contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigned the existing closets</a> to maximize usable area and even found a place to add a new closet in the hallway adjacent to the master bedroom. To keep the apartment “simple, so it doesn’t feel too crowded,” says JoAnn, the kitchen counter stools swivel toward the living room and act as additional seating. A pull-out sofa in the living room does double duty for overnight guests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, their Sweeten contractor took all of JoAnn and Brian’s ideas and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a space</a> with the prep surfaces they needed, while also housing their cooking tools. They chose to leave the footprint as it was, changing out everything else. Rental-grade cabinetry was replaced with custom Shaker-style cabinetry in two tones.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30243" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along the back wall, which holds the new Bertazzoni stove, Bosch dishwasher, and Liebherr refrigerator, the cabinetry is floor-to-ceiling white. The peninsula sports a dark wood for contrast. Both sides are topped with white Caesarstone counters. Glass subway tile backsplash and a larger-format gray tile on the floors complete the look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30260 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before08-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before08" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30247 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store11" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30248" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store13" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bath, out went the old tub. In its place, their Sweeten contractor installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a> divided from the rest of the bath with a piece of frameless glass for a more open feel. Gray mosaic tiles in complementary shapes—a hex in the shower and a weave in the rest of the room—were chosen for floors. White subway tile on the walls kept things simple, and a modern vanity provided much-needed storage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30246 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30249" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next to the vanity, the contractor found room behind the wall, so he opened it up to add floor-to-ceiling built-in shelving, which JoAnn and Brian use for toiletries and small decorative objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom and living room were overhauled with new paint and doors. Yet another archway leading from the bedroom area to the living room was removed for more airiness overhead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30250" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They reported a seamless experience working with their Sweeten contractor: “We sent him many pictures of what we liked and he really paid attention,&#8221; said JoAnn. &#8220;We are extremely happy with all the choices. Their work ethic was exemplary. They showed up on time and made themselves available when we needed them. They were conscious of our budget. The contractor and his team were very respectful to our neighbors so as not to disturb anyone. They kept everything neat and orderly. Our apartment was completed in a timely fashion and exceeded our expectations!”</p>
<p><em>Thanks, JoAnn and Brian, for sharing your new Manhattan &#8220;nest&#8221; with us.</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Freshen up a worn-out bathroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: After renting an alcove studio in Park Slope for about two years, Matt, a software engineer, purchased his first home in July 2013. The 360-square-foot apartment in a neighboring co-op, built in 1950, would also become the future home of a cat named Josie, adopted in the months following the renovation. Four years passed while Matt lived in the space and saved up some money to update the outdated and decrepit bathroom. “Random pieces of tile were missing, my old sink was missing one of its support legs, and parts of the ceiling showed weakening,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I wanted a complete renovation not only to feel better about the space, but also as an investment.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Because this was my first renovation, I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful for Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.</p></blockquote>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Not knowing where to begin the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>, Matt found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with his contractor</a>. He imagined a clean and refreshing space, one with an inoffensive style that wouldn’t deter a future buyer or sublet tenant. “I love subway tile, so selecting that for the walls was an easy decision,” said Matt. Large-format charcoal gray square floor tile completes the simple backdrop for the space. A floating wood vanity injects a modern sensibility. For additional storage, a matching <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wooden cabinet</a> sits in a recessed spot on the wall opposite the vanity. And to make sure the cabinet didn’t protrude too far out, its depth was halved.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="floating-wood-vanity-under-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49151 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Floating wood vanity under a white sink in a white bathroom with walk in shower and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-sink-brown-vanity" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49153 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White sink with brushed nickel bathroom fixtures and a dark brown vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Matt intended to install a new bathtub, a tricky plumbing situation would have affected nearby apartments, so the installation was a no-go. Instead, the existing tub was transformed into a spacious walk-in shower, complete with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/shower-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corner shelves</a>, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding glass door</a>, and subtly patterned floor tile. “Despite the scope change, I couldn’t be happier with the result,&#8221; he reports. &#8220;The shower is huge!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge? Living through the renovation. “For about seven weeks, my bed became my apartment. It’s where I slept, ate, read, and watched Netflix.” And while his bathroom was out of commission, Matt took advantage of the full bathroom in the building’s basement, which was newly renovated. “Each day I waddled down there with flip-flops and a shower caddy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I felt like I was back in college using the dorm’s community bathrooms.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-walk-in-shower-area" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49154 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="White walk in shower area with large nickel shower head and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><img decoding="async" title="large-nickel-showerhead-in-walk-in-shower" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49155 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="Large nickel showerhead and open shelves in a white walk in shower area with subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Challenges aside, Matt worked with Sweeten every step of the way, from project posting to completion. “Sweeten’s client services team was engaged throughout the project and made sure I had everything I needed,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They were really specific in their communication; during the bidding process I was asked how one contractor compared to another, and other questions that helped guide my decision-making.” Heading into the project, he states, &#8220;Because this was my first renovation, I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful for Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-wooden-cabinet-and-dark-floor-tile" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49156 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="Brown wooden cabinet in recessed space over dark gray floor tile and white subway tiles on walls after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Matt’s advice for future first-time renovators: “Do your best to limit options for each decision, using your theme as guidance. It’s far easier to select the color of stone shower shelves from three colors instead of 10.” He also found his contractor’s input incredibly valuable, “My contractor’s best contribution was providing thoughtful, targeted material and fixture options,” which he said saved him from decision fatigue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Strengthen your defense against the mess</h2>
<p><em>In our month-long Organizational Blitz, see how Sweeten homeowners have whipped their homes into shape.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30038 mb-0 size-chrono" title="newsletter-banner" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-723x482.jpg" alt="newsletter banner" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to keeping your home in good shape, every space—from the bedroom to the bar—has a role to play. Even if you’re a minimalist, you’ve got plenty of stuff to store (perhaps a little less than the rest of us), and creating storage that can accommodate everything is crucial. If you find yourself closer to the maximalist end of the spectrum (count us in!), whether you’ve got a growing pile of books or an impressive liquor collection, getting organized is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25922 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bookshelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13-723x1095.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="1095" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With bookshelves, you don’t have to consolidate your collection of books to maintain order in your home. Any room can host your library—and we’ve got 5 ways to prove it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22188 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06-723x517.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="517" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best organization strategy takes into consideration every room in your home, including the bedroom. From floating shelves to custom built-ins, find spots for all of your personal belongings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30096 mb-0 size-full" title="desk nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No need for a separate room to create a home office. Take inspiration from one of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these 5 desk nooks</a> and make your space work for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23959 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home bar" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade ago, Ying and her parents purchased an investment property on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It was a prewar studio apartment, perfect for a young professional right out of college. Ying made it her home for a couple of years and then moved on to another apartment in the East 60s that was better suited to her needs. The studio became a rental apartment for several years and cycled through three different tenants until it hit the rental limits under co-op rules. By this time, Ying had moved to Portland, Oregon, where she currently works in communications, but she and her parents still made frequent visits to New York City. They envisioned renovating the space to create a comfortable second home for themselves on those occasions.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. Ying knew that she needed a contractor she could trust to manage the project since she wouldn’t be on site and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to Sweeten’s website. Her plans included new paint, lighting, and flooring, as well as comprehensive custom built-ins along several walls and a brand-new spa bathroom. This<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten contractor</a> turned out to be the right one for the job, and he quickly got to work after discussing Ying’s vision with her over phone and email. She shared her <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a> board with him, and told him that her goals were to “streamline the entrance [by] knocking out that closet there, and leverage the blank wall as storage to make the studio look cleaner and give it more room.” Ying was inspired by the techniques used by designers of tiny houses, where “every corner is maximized.” The Sweeten contractor was in total agreement after seeing the space, and produced a proposal with the intention of achieving a look that was “fresh, clean, and simple.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-and-living-room-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49168" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-Before-02a.jpg" alt="Image of the bathroom and living room before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-Before-02a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-Before-02a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-Before-02a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="custom-oak-wood-cabinetry-near-dining-nook" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49163" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="Custom oak wood cabinetry near dining nook and maple wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="maple-flooring-with-oak-wood-cabinetry" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49167" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="Maple wooden flooring and built in custom cabinetry in oak wood along with brushed nickel handles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, they reconfigured the space by the entrance to create a small dining nook. Ying chose a rift oak wood veneer for the custom cabinetry, paired off with brushed nickel handles with squared-off edges. There’s no longer any need for storage furniture, since the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> accommodate space for hanging clothes as well as shelving, and anything else one might need on a short trip to the city. On the floors, Ying went with a prefinished maple in a light stain. To contrast, the new lighting fixtures were matte black with modern lines, which tied in with the existing black window frames.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hex-tiles-and-subway-wall-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49169 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="White bathroom with white subway tiles and contrasting gray grouting with slate colored hex tiles in shower and bathroom after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Ying’s favorite part of the renovation, the end result was one befitting a luxurious pied-à-terre. The tub was traded out for a walk-in shower with frameless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass walls and doors</a>, and outfitted with white subway tile and contrasting gray grout. A slate-colored hex tile was added to the floor of both the shower and the bathroom (in different sizes). A custom vanity was installed with a white Thassos marble countertop.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-subway-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White bathroom with subway tiles and marble countertop over vanity and white sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-in-shower-area" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49171" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="White subway tiles in narrow walk in shower with glass door and an oversized showerhead after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ying credits the great communication and management skills of her Sweeten contractor for getting the job done right. She has a self-professed obsession with attention to detail but knew that she would have to trust her team given that she was directing the project remotely. “They were really good at keeping me up to speed. They shared images of the ongoing renovation. We were in contact weekly. While the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-op took a LONG time</a> to get back to us on the paperwork, my contractor was instrumental in helping chase them down.” Ying adds, “I think that it helped from a design and reno perspective that I was never breathing down their necks. Pick a team you can trust to bring your aesthetic to life. And don’t feel worried about voicing your opinions—you are the client, after all! But be respectful; you are both working on the same project!”</p>
