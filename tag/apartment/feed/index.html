				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago is famous for its two-flat and three-flat apartments, which include separate units on separate floors. Investing in a Chicago multi-flat can be a financial advantage thanks to its practicality. You can reside in one apartment while renting out the others to generate supplementary income.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remodeling multi-unit structures can be a bit more involved than standalone houses since you have close neighbors to consider.

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the average first-time home buyer, purchasing a condo is often a more affordable choice than a single-family home.

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago has unique challenges when it comes to remodeling apartments. Therefore, it&#8217;s important to work with a contractor who has experience working in your area and can navigate the challenges effectively.</span></p><h4>Accessibility</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the apartment is located in a high-rise building, accessibility can be an issue. Large items, such as appliances or seamless slab countertop materials, may need to be hoisted up through windows. This adds to the cost and complexity of the project.</span></p><h4>Permitting process</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The permitting process in Chicago can take several weeks or even months depending on the complexity of the scope. In Chicago, the Department of Water Management approves plumbing permits and the Department of Buildings issues electrical permits. Buildings that are designated as historical landmarks may require a landmark permit for certain types of apartment remodeling projects. Some examples include modifying load-bearing walls, adding or removing plumbing or electrical, and changes made to the HVAC system. </span></p><h4>Building age</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many buildings in Chicago are older and may not be up to current building code in their infrastructure (plumbing/electrical/HVAC system). This is usually discovered after a contractor begins demolition and has the opportunity to see behind the apartment’s walls. </span></p>					</div>

<h3>Keeping their Jackson Heights remodel in view<span>—for years</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We purchased our co-op roughly three years before embarking on the renovation. Our goal was to totally revamp the apartment into open-plan spaces, while preserving its period features. Like many pre-war homes, it had a lot of small rooms. I think our result is proof that, even if there’s no perfect moment to remodel, intensive planning pays off.</span></p>

<div></div>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Keeping historic details</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The 1,400-square-foot unit is located in a 1921 historical-district co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens. The place hadn’t been touched since the 1970s and was in rough shape. But there were nice original details, like beautiful wood floors with inlaid borders and a period fireplace. It needed a significant overhaul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dia and I didn’t rush it. We’d rented in the neighborhood for a couple of years to make sure we liked the area—and we did. After finding the co-op, we wanted to take our time and put our stamp on it. We spent almost two years planning the remodel. By the time we were ready to proceed, Dia was pregnant with our daughter, Madeleine. We were eager to get the job done, and ready to pick up the pace. </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">In-depth research and planning </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten. We made clear in our overview that we were ready to obtain our co-op board approvals, navigate the permitting, order materials, and get started. By then we’d spent a lot of time planning the layout, materials, and finishes. We had 40 pages of diagrams, renderings, and materials lists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Five or six Sweeten contractors came for site visits and gave us estimates. Right away, one stood out. He had printed out our mammoth set of plans (which he jokingly referred to as “the bible”), came armed with excellent questions, spoke knowledgeably about what would and would not be possible given NYC building codes, and gave us a detailed and reasonable estimate. We knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wanted to hire him</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">A gut remodel with an extensive to-do list </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Going in, we made sure the contractor understood that we had a specific vision, and that we were demanding. We planned to open the kitchen, living, and dining rooms, build a modern kitchen, renovate both bathrooms to spa standards, and add closet space. At the same time, we intended to keep original details, and even increase them by adding period chandeliers and other fixtures that would complement the co-op’s 1920s style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Dark blue built-in cabinets and shelving with white counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52013" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Kitchen-Closet-01.gif" alt="Built-in kitchen closet storage with doors opening and closing" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52006" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Our renovation scope was specific. It included replacing and relocating the breaker box, and installing new switches and sockets. We wanted to remove several unnecessary walls, and rebuild two walls and two water-damaged window encasements. We requested new baseboards and crown moldings. In the kitchen, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to add a peninsula</a>, a custom pantry, and a sideboard. We wanted to build closets in the bedrooms and entryway, as well as custom cabinets and radiator covers. We’d paint every room and refinish the floors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Problem solving with the general contractor team</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Several miracles occurred in the kitchen. When we removed a wall to make way for the new peninsula, it resulted in a break in the floor inlay, but the floor subcontractor recreated the </span><span class="s2">multi-wood pattern so skillfully that you can’t tell what is original and what is new. Our appliance vendor’s repeated delivery delays caused a need for our countertops to be installed before the appliances. Our Sweeten contractor got them in when they arrived, despite incredible difficulty—installing our refrigerator even required removing the baseboard temporarily.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our initial instincts about planning carefully were validated, but the process also taught us to always have a Plan B.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">When our single-piece sideboard countertop was too big for the elevator, the guys carried them up five flights of stairs. And when the new electrical box occupied the former microwave place, the cabinetmaker came up with a built-in pantry, designed with an interior cutout to fit the oven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In our bathroom, we had other inspired solutions. We wanted to move the toilet but a steel beam prevented placement in the new rough-in location. Our contractor proposed a wall-hung toilet that freed up space for it to stay in the original location and squeezed in a vanity, which wasn’t possible with the traditional commode. Thanks to supply-chain disruptions during Covid-19, we ended up sourcing bathroom tile other than that from our original wishlist—and the manufacturer offered no coordinating trim. Our general contractor found a trim that matched and drove more than 700 miles to collect every piece they could find.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Homeowners share their renovation advice</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As first-time renovators, our biggest questions from the beginning were about how to manage the many subcontractors and aspects of the work happening simultaneously. But our Sweeten contractor pulled it all together. Our initial instincts about planning carefully were validated, but the process also taught us to always have a Plan B. We certainly learned the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweeten-renovator-reviews-10-things-they-loved-about-their-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of picking the right contractor</a>—one who inspires confidence and keeps your best interests at heart.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We couldn’t have asked for a more professional and dedicated team. At the start, he helped us gather the necessary co-op board sign-offs and connected us with an architect. He managed the permitting process seamlessly, despite NYC Department of Buildings changes during Covid-19. At every step, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our general contractor</a> went above and beyond to help us realize our vision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I’m not sure anyone comes in under budget in a renovation. We didn’t, but we stayed </span><span class="s2">roughly in line with our expectations. There was a payoff, in any case. Our beautiful result! Even having done the project six months after having our baby and during a pandemic, we feel peaceful. We are in love with our home.</span></p>

</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Laying out the plan for high ceilings</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners closed on an 850-square-foot loft apartment in a multi-building complex in Greenwich Village, just a short stroll from Washington Square Park. The building dated to 1890 and had formerly housed a cast-iron factory. The apartment itself benefited from the structure’s history with high 16-foot ceilings and original detailing. The interior finishes were outdated, however, since it had been decades since the last renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47451" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg" alt="loft homeowner" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They planned to convert the one-bedroom apartment into a two-bedroom while making full use of the ceiling height. A mezzanine level around much of the apartment would allow for storage and display of their art and decorative pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen was tucked away in a dark corner of the loft, with dark wood cabinetry and black countertops adding to the gloom. It made more sense to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap the locations of the bathroom</a> and the kitchen. This brought the kitchen closer to the the dining and living spaces. The bathroom itself needed a gut renovation. Its finish materials and all the wiring and plumbing were deteriorating.</span></p>

<h3>Out with the debris, in with the light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As their Sweeten contractor began to demo the space, he unearthed&#8230;actual earth. The contractor found about eight inches of “some kind of dirt floor” beneath the flooring. He had to excavate it along with the rest of the demolition debris—a first for this seasoned contractor. He speculated it was perhaps due to the building’s past as a factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They worked to create a gallery-like space featuring bright white walls, highlighted with blackened steel accents. Keeping the finishes simple allowed the airiness of the space to shine.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47437 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>A triumph of clerestory windows</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there are now two bedrooms rather than one, the homeowners were able to preserve a sense of expansiveness by not taking the walls all the way up to the ceiling. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clear glass clerestory windows</a> were installed</span><span class="s1"> in the bedrooms, as well as in the bathroom so that natural light could still shine in each part of the renovated loft. </span></p>
<h3>An integrated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the hallways, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, a steel rail was installed for a custom library ladder, to give access to the mezzanine areas. This unique system used brushed steel for the rail and brackets, and black-anodized aluminum for the portable ladder, to make it light enough to carry from room to room. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Storage-12-scaled.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the living room lost a few feet to create the second bedroom, it gained plenty of linear feet in display storage as a result of the loft renovation. Custom black steel bookcases run along the length of one wall. The contractor secured these shelves through to the studs as they were rebuilding the apartment, so they&#8217;ll be able to handle any load. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The living room space opens up to the dining nook, which also houses an upright piano. An <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g2262/gallery-wall-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjacent gallery wall</a>, decorated with black-framed art, provides visual interest along the interior wall. Recessed lighting and statement pendants support the minimalist aesthetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47429" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47433 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg" alt="library ladder" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<h3>Extra storage for the bathroom</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the smaller bedroom next to the kitchen, they created a lofted sleeping area for guests with a simple mattress set-up, which is also accessible via the library ladder. The elevated sleeping loft allows the floor area of the room to be used by the homeowners as a closet and dressing area. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47427" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg" alt="loft bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom received a similarly modern treatment with a deep soaking tub. A matte black towel hook and shower and sink fixtures create contrast, and match the overall black-and-white motif. Unusually, the homeowners were able to add storage above the shower area, also accessible with the portable library ladder. As with the overhead kitchen storage, the space above was built without shelves or compartments, to accommodate large or odd-shaped items. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple now has a beautiful home that handles their storage, showcases their art and treasures, lets in the light—and even lets them share their space with overnight guests.  </span></p>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom need color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owners Rachel and Michael didn’t want to go super modern with their bathroom update, so they went with a classic look that complemented their apartment’s prewar roots. The original space was dark and in an uninspiring neutral, the shower was cramped and confined by uneven walls, and old chipped tile throughout had clearly seen better days.  A remodel was in order. The couple posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43078 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Creating more space without changing the layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping the existing layout intact, Rachel and Michael made crucial updates, starting with tearing down the unnecessary wall framing of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which added an extra nine inches to the height of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and swapping the old glass door for a new one. With a bigger and brighter space to fill, a waterfall of penny tile in various shades of blue shines as a showpiece. The open and light-filled shower with its mosaic of tile is now Michael’s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43069 size-full" title="Blue and white bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="blue bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43072 mb-0 size-full" title="Console sink and medicine cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="console sink" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A contrast between colors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dusky shade of blue paint dominates the upper half of the walls while balancing the crackle-finish white subway tile with the right amount of contrast. White hexagon floor tile adds another layer of pattern. The tub also experienced a major improvement: out went the old tub with a clunky, external drainage system, and in went the new with an integrated system, vintage-style wall-mount tub filler, and a tiled tub surround.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43077" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43076" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Same bathroom, bigger feel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a month of going back and forth on deciding on the replacement, the couple switched out the boxy, builder-grade vanity for an open console design, making the space feel considerably larger. A mirrored medicine cabinet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple-light fixture over the vanity</a>—Rachel’s favorite details—complete the look. The result? A room once bathed in beige gets new energy. [For these homeowners, an open-console vanity was a must.

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43073 mb-0 size-full" title="subway tile and toilet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-4.jpg" alt="subway tile bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Dust bunnies averted! Michael noted that his contractor did a spectacular job of keeping the bathroom clean, combating the huge amount of debris generated by the work.</p>

Increasingly, we are seeing renovation projects aimed at resale. Whether you’re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it’s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale, especially if you know you&#8217;ll outgrow your current home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home’s attractiveness to potential buyers. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers an overview of the best home upgrades for resale value.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46407 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Should You Remodel for Resale?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re moving sooner rather than later, your renovation should be strategic and targeted in the areas that will create the biggest difference to buyers with minimal cost to you. Walk around your home with your real estate agent and discuss whether there are any basic improvement projects that might facilitate a quick sale for top dollar. While decluttering and staging should be the first steps, some homes do need some extra work. If yours falls into this category, <b>ask yourself the following questions:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I willing to accept a lower price per square foot to compensate for the condition of the home?</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I scared off by the hassle of a renovation project?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer to both questions is no, it sounds like a renovation might be in your future!</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Apartments</h3>
<p>If you live in an apartment, there is usually another entity—a co-op or condo board—in conjunction with a management company, who is responsible for the upkeep of the building systems and its exterior, as well as any landscaping. Neither you nor the buyer of your apartment will need to deal with these issues personally (unless you’re on the board, but that’s a whole different story.) As an owner, you’re responsible for “walls-in,” so it makes sense to focus on cosmetic improvements that will help your apartment show better.</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Houses</h3>
<p>The priorities are different when renovating a house for resale. Since homeowners are responsible for the whole building and the lot on which the house sits, there will likely be more pressing concerns beyond the color of the bedroom walls. (Also, buyers of townhouses generally expect to do some work on their new homes after closing.) This means that your money shouldn’t go to renovations but to repairs: ensuring that all systems are in good working order, that there are no structural issues, and that nothing on the exterior needs immediate attention.</p>
<p>You’ll generally have to dig deeper into your pockets to fund these types of projects, but it’s likely that your house will sit on the market if you don’t address them. If you don’t deal with pressing repairs, and they come up during inspection, expect the buyer to ask for credits at closing in order to compensate for them.</p>
<h3><span class="s1">The best interior </span><span class="s1">home upgrades for </span><span class="s1">resale value</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tip: Focus your time and money on remodeling the most visible parts of your home. This approach tends to bring the best value (we’ll address exterior updates further down.) These are the interior, whole-room projects that recoup the most home resale value according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, minor kitchen remodel that costs $23,452 has a resale value of $18,206 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, major kitchen remodel that costs $68,490 has a resale value of $40,127 and recoups <b>58%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom remodel that costs $21,377 has a resale value of $13,688 and recoups<b> 64%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale bathroom remodel that costs $67,106 has a resale value of $37,995 and recoups <b>56%</b></span></li>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Small </span><span class="s1">home resale upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Add a fresh coat of paint. </b>Especially if the current colors are very bright or unusual. You might love lime green, but it’s safe to say that many buyers won’t. Many homeowners can repaint themselves, but sometimes, it’s worth calling in the pros.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Change out kitchen cabinet fronts.</b> You can do this in a few different ways—simply sanding and repainting the existing surface is the most budget-friendly, or you can choose to replace the doors and hardware while leaving the interior boxes in place. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Swap out your fixtures.</b>  If your lighting and plumbing fixtures look like they are from the ’80s—and not in a good way—consider switching them out. You don’t need to go high-end; there are plenty of good-looking options at big box stores. Our suggestion? Pick something with clean lines and classic finishes. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Refinish your floors.</b> If they are scratched, peeling, or look damaged, this is a must. Any sign of water damage, for example, is not only an aesthetic problem but is also an indicator to buyers that there may be a history of leaks in the building. And if you have carpets…this is a huge turnoff for many buyers, so consider replacing them.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Rip out outdated trends that serve no function</b>. This applies to vinyl faux-wood paneling, weird glass block walls, and “decorative” room dividers that are now just eyesores.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Single-space </span><span class="s1">home upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen updates.</b> This is an important room for buyers and is often immediately visible upon entering an apartment, so you’ll want to focus your attention here. In addition to refurbishing the cabinet doors, replace the hardware and fixtures. You can also go further and replace the countertops and backsplash. Visually, these make the biggest impact. If you have a very dark kitchen, going lighter will appeal to buyers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom updates. </b>After the kitchen, this is the most important space in an apartment. Particularly if there is just one—it’s important to make it look functional and clean. The easiest and most affordable ways to update the bath are to paint and change out the medicine cabinet mirror for an updated model. Updating the tile, vanity, and reglazing the tub will also be good ways to freshen up the space.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>“Flex space” addition</b>. While it’s impossible to add actual square footage to an apartment (unless you’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/"><span class="s2">combining apartments</span></a>), it’s often helpful to add the idea of one. This can be done by putting up pressurized walls to carve out an office nook, or by adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/"><span class="s2">sliding doors </span></a>across a large living room to create a den space. While this type of renovation won’t change the legal designation of the number of bedrooms in your unit, it helps buyers envision more uses for the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">The best exterior home upgrades for resale value</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale garage door replacement that costs $3,695 has a resale value of $3,491 and recoups <b>94%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing vinyl siding with mid-range manufactured stone veneer costs on average $9,357 has a resale value of $8,943 and recoups <b>95%</b></span></li>

</ul>
<h4>Curb appeal project ideas</h4>
<p>Curb appeal catches the eye of prospective buyers. Consider these exterior ideas to boost a home&#8217;s resale value:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repair the driveway<b> $1,000-$5,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Spruce up the house number <b>$10-$100</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Invest in landscaping <b>$200-$2,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repaint the exterior<b> $5,000-$15,000</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remember: </b>In highly localized markets, like metropolitan cities, it’s important to make decisions in consultation with your real estate agent. What works in one neighborhood might not work in another. They will be the best person to guide you on where it makes sense to invest in a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep in mind you don’t need to spend a lot of money to upgrade your home. Weigh the financial and time costs, and consider whether you’d take a lower purchase price to save yourself the trouble. And remember, it’s not about recouping the exact value of the renovation in the sale price, but getting buyers to make offers in the first place!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A first-time homeowner mixes sustainability with the comforts of her native country</h2>
<p><em>Giulia renovated her one-bedroom apartment in a 1920s brownstone co-op in Park Slope <span style="color: #000000;">soon after she purchased it, and </span>before she moved out of her Lower East Side rental. She developed the design herself for the 500-square-foot home and posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor. The space desperately needed updating and some major space planning. While Giulia, who is from Italy, was able to bring in lots of </em>color<em>, European style, and ideas from her home country, maximizing storage was her main goal. Here’s how she did it.</em></p>

<em>Guest blog post by homeowner Giulia in Park Slope</em></p>
<p>My vision for the space was a large and happy living room, a functional kitchen, and a comfortable bathroom. The whole apartment really needed a lot of updating; the appliances and fixtures were very old in the kitchen and bathroom, and there was so little storage space. I really like mid-century style and lots of color on a white background. The place had big, “old” character in its window and door moldings, fireplace, and wood floor. To find a good balance, I added clean, modern elements like the hexagonal tiles and almost-invisible closet doors.</p>

<p>Given <span style="color: #000000;">my occupation in researching energy savings in the home</span> and my interest in sustainable buildings, I included a few items that could be considered environmentally green:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-flow plumbing fixtures in the bathroom and kitchen; the toilet is a 0.8 gpf, the lowest flow rate available on the market</li>
<li>Zero VOC paints for walls and moldings (Natura by Benjamin Moore)</li>
<li>Low VOC adhesives and sealants throughout</li>
<li>LED-compatible lighting fixtures and LED bulbs throughout</li>
</ul>
<p>Since storage was a priority, I looked for spaces where I could incorporate cabinetry. Right away, I saw the <span style="color: #000000;">living room </span>bay windows scream, “Window bench!” I might have seen this kind of design element in a movie when I was growing up. I never thought I would have one for myself; I was so excited. The bay was also a good spot for a big, round dinner table.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37962 size-full" title="window seat storage " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, living room, design, construction, storage, brownstone co-op renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-07-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>I split the bench into three parts, like petals, with tops that easily opened. The size of the interiors was perfect for big-volume items. On the ends of the window seat, I included two small cubbies to show decorative objects, small plants, and books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37961 mb-0 size-full" title="living room " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-06.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, living room, design, construction, brownstone co-op renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The original <span style="color: #000000;">kitchen</span> had a lot of unused space: just a tiny stove and a few cabinets, and the uppers didn’t even go to the ceiling. The materials—linoleum flooring, cheap tiles, and low-quality cabinets and countertop—weren’t in good condition.</p>

<p>We removed a small soffit to maximize the area. For the upper area, I wanted a mix of open shelves and cabinets. Too many closed cabinets would suffocate the space. Plus, the open shelves “solved” the corner issue and helped avoid weird, L-shaped upper cabinets. I love the contrast of the blue and white oak. I had the same colors in my bedroom in Rome when I was a kid and I think it just reminded me of home. I included two wooden cubbies above the fridge and the hood to break the continuity of the <span style="color: #000000;">blue</span> and make the design more dynamic. The backsplash is a subway tile in an inverted concave design to add more movement to the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37964 mb-0 size-full" title="dish rack " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-09.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, kitchen sink, design, construction, brownstone co-op renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-09-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-09-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Above the sink is a drying rack shelf, a trick I stole from my home country. Wet dishes drip off directly into the sink, avoiding puddles of standing water on the counter. Also, I don’t need to use any of my limited counter space to dry my dishes. For the lower cabinets, I maximized the space and the corners with “hinged” foldout doors which would allow me to have access to the full space underneath the sink.</p>
<p>I designed a tall closet as part of the kitchen storage for my broom, vacuum, and cleaning supplies. I found it funny as the last thing anyone would want to think about when moving into a new place is, “Where do I put this tall broom?”</p>

<p>Since the <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom</span> and the kitchen are next to each other, I pictured their floors similar but not identical. I chose the same material and shape—hexagonal cement tiles—but different colors. In the kitchen, I wanted a more neutral color given the strong character of the blue cabinets, so I went for a light gray. In the bathroom, I got a bit more creative, picking a “3D-look” pattern, with yellow, white and gray.</p>
<p>The bathroom had space issues as well: A small tub took up much of the room, preventing me from having a nice, big sink. The pink fixtures had a kind of pretty, “vintage” look, but they needed to be modernized and replaced with something new and more functional.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37966 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom sink " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>I don’t love bathtubs, especially if they are small and tight; I would rather have a big and comfortable shower, instead! So I designed a rectangular shower, which would be shorter than the tub—leaving more space for the sink—but still bigger than a traditional shower stall.</p>
<p>A shower door would have eaten up space, so I opted for a rectangular opening and no door. To keep the water inside the glass walls, I chose a “rain-effect” showerhead. (The rod next to the showerhead is a bracket that holds the glass wall in place.)</p>
<p>My original idea for the floor was to have an “infinite shower” with a sloped floor and no threshold. This wasn’t going to work, so I had to include the white flexible rubber threshold glued to the floor tiles to keep the water in. (Not the best in terms of looks, but it works!) I attached a hand-held bidet to the toilet—another “European” detail of mine. I also repurposed a mini desk from West Elm as a sink vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37969 size-full" title="floor plan " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<em>(Above)</em> Floor plan of bedroom and closet</p>
<p>Another storage puzzle was my <span style="color: #000000;">bedroom</span> closet, the one and only closet in the apartment. It was small and sat next to the bedroom door. That wall was also the only spot where I could put some type of dresser or wardrobe to store my clothes. I decided to close up the closet side in the bedroom and have it open from its short-side located in the hallway instead. I installed a telescopic rod that can be pulled straight out for clothes to be hung on it. For additional storage, there are shelves above the closet and a deep drawer below, where I keep bags.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-01.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37956 mb-0 size-full" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-01.gif" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>I left the original wood flooring in the <span style="color: #000000;">living room and bedroom</span>. I had it laminated and stained with a gray finish to maintain the color and avoid any gold and red shades. We did a lot of testing before finding the perfect balance of gray and wood.</p>
<p>The countertop and shelves in the kitchen and the tops of the bay window bench are all made of white oak. I really like this finish and the way it contrasts with the white of the walls. Also, it’s a pretty resistant material, good for these kinds of applications.</p>
<p>Designing my apartment was fun and exciting but challenging. I had to learn how to make decisions very quickly every day. The six months of renovating were some of the most difficult months of my life; I’m pretty happy it’s over! My friends have been a huge help throughout the entire process; I’m very lucky I have them. Sweeten, too, was helpful as I was wrapping everything up.</p>
<p>I learned so much throughout the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared for much more time than is estimated</li>
<li>When possible, choose simple design ideas</li>
<li>Do the work all at once—don’t split the job into pieces</li>
<li>Clarify details with the contractor prior to starting the job</li>
<li>Understand what’s included in your budget and what’s a change order</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I’m so happy living in my newly renovated space, and my friends all like it, too.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Giulia. We hope you love your new first home!</em></p>

<h3>Why the right general contractor is important</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating can be a complicated process. However, the more you know about working with a general contractor, the better prepared you’ll be. While these professionals execute the labor of your renovation, they are also a collaborator to your dream home. Their team will be working in your space for several months. Because of this, you really want to be confident in knowing how to hire a contractor<span>—the right one for <em>your</em> project</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten outlines the process—from what to look for, to the key responsibilities you can expect from your general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Do you need a general contractor or a handyman?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step to starting your project is figuring out the scope of your renovation. Depending on the level of labor your project requires, you will either need a general contractor or a handyman (or DIY!). To decipher the difference, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you hanging things on walls, or taking down walls?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you re-grouting tiles, or replacing them?</li>
<li>Smaller projects to make repairs or patch-over errors are handyman-ready. On the other hand, large-scale projects that involve electric or plumbing will require a permit or inspection. In this case, a contractor with a state Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license will be obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining labor for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For first-time renovators, figuring out what kind of labor is required for the project can be hard to determine. If you live in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op</a> or condo, your alteration agreement may provide guidelines when hiring a general contractor. In other situations, checking your city’s Department of Buildings will offer information on the types of projects that require a permit. <strong>The most important thing to remember is that cutting corners with unlicensed workers is never worth the risk. </strong>It often leads to homeowners needing to pay extra to fix unfinished, subpar, or non-permitted work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing the research to determine if you need the services of a general contractor is a crucial step in getting your project off the ground. Then the next step is finding the best contractor for your job.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to hire a contractor suited to your project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process of interviewing and hiring a general contractor, start by looking for someone with experience in your neighborhood and who has done similar work. This can help you narrow down the field from thousands of general contractors to just a handful of experienced professionals. Keep these questions in mind as you search:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Has the contractor done work in your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Has the contractor done similar work to what you’re looking to get done?</li>
<li>Can the contractor provide quality references and photos of past work?</li>
<li>Is the contractor licensed? (Working with an unlicensed contractor isn’t worth the risk!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask to see some of their past projects in person or to speak to their past clients—at least two. General contractors in Sweeten&#8217;s network have completed transformational renovations with past clients who are still happy with the work years later. This indicates that the contractor&#8217;s work has held up over time. <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten matches homeowners</a> to a selection of contractors based on location, budget, scope, and style for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think would be a good fit for your project, take it one step further and make sure they’re a good fit for you. You’ll be working with this contractor for the duration of your project, so you should feel compatible! Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>
<h4>Are they communicative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you can trust your contractor to be responsive throughout the entire renovation process. Both parties will need to be on the same page, especially in terms of timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a good fit personality and style-wise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>First impressions do matter! The contractor should be able to understand and carry out your particular sense of style. Additionally, with the amount of time they’ll be spending in your home, look for someone who meshes with your personality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do they have recent and reliable references?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s important<span style="color: #333333;"> to review </span>recent references for similar projects that your contractor has completed. You should be aware of the level of satisfaction of past clients. At Sweeten, our contractors have profiles that highlight past projects and client reviews to help you decide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does a general contractor do?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your general contractor manages your project from start to finish, focusing on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain proper licensing, insurance, and additional documents required by city, state, and specific to building needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review site conditions and all relevant documents and drawings in order to fully understand the project and generate a proposal and bid (the proposal is the plan and the bid is the proposed cost)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Specify the final scope of work, and schedule, and come up with a contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Define the payment and deliverables schedules</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Request and follow advice from the architects, engineers, or design team</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Manage and coordinate general aspects of a project, like site requirements</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide skilled labor, tools, equipment, and various services</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Coordinate subcontractors and other trades required by the scope of work and oversee the quality of their work</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain schedule and communication with clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review project completion with the client and final payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asking general contractors for estimates (at least 3)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contractor will partner with you to decide on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The final scope of work</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>The best form of communication, and how often they should check in with you</li>
<li>Budget and payment schedule (make sure you have everything in writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweeten recommends getting 3-5 estimates from contractors to see where the price range falls. This also allows you to experience the different personalities and communication styles of the contractors. Who do you have the best rapport with? Who do you feel the most comfortable with? These factors will play a big part in your decision when hiring a general contractor.</p>
<h3>Understanding estimates from general contractors</h3>
<p>Bid leveling is a crucial step that will allow you to break down and compare the services the contractor can offer at each price point. This occurs once you have received estimates, or bids, from contractors.</p>
<p>For example, one contractor who gives a higher-priced bid may provide more individual services, like answering questions on the weekend or putting a mood board together for you. A comparative breakdown of the bids will reveal a clearer picture of what services you want as a renovator.</p>
<h4>Sweeten offers free bid-leveling services to homeowners</h4>
<p>New to renovating and unsure how to read bids? Sweeten provides a free bid-leveling call to all homeowners who use the service. Read all about Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling and estimate comparison call.</a> (You can also read up on this process with Sweeten&#8217;s guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you meet the contractors during site visits, be prepared with a list of questions to ask. Do not be afraid to speak up about what you want! That being said, be open to a contractor&#8217;s ideas and suggestions. The licensed contractor is a professional with a wealth of knowledge about construction and years of experience. This is their specialty, and they likely have answers to all of your questions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple&#8217;s optimism yields a washer-and-dryer—and more—in Brooklyn</h2>
<p><em>Who wants to schlep laundry up and down five flights of stairs? That’s what motivated Lynn, Craig, and their pooch Pistol to renovate their first home, a 1,200-square-foot Prospect Heights co-op. But not so fast. First, they couldn’t find a contractor willing to take on the job of remodeling two tiny bathrooms. Then they couldn’t get one on board for a washer-and-dryer install. They eventually turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, where they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and were matched with a vetted general contractor not only </em>willing,<em> but excited, to take on the job. All this while the clock was ticking on their move-in date.</em></p>

<p>After living in rentals forever—from 300-square-foot studios to windowless apartments— we were ready to buy something of our own. When Lynn co-founded her business—Dome, a multidisciplinary design studio—in 2014, we casually began to look for a place where she could work from home.</p>
<p>For two years, we visited open houses to learn about the Brooklyn housing market. Many of the homes felt oddly chopped up, hastily constructed, overpriced, or were projects too intimidating for us to tackle for our first home purchase. We wanted a space that felt open and bright, where we wouldn’t hit the walls within a year, and that was in a welcoming neighborhood.</p>

<p>When we found this two-bedroom, 1.5 bath co-op in a circa 1930s Prospect Heights building close to express subways, our friends, Prospect Park’s off-leash area, and saw it had lots of space and light, we immediately put in a bid. We thought we had a chance, given it was a steep fifth-floor walk-up—a deterrent for many buyers in a competitive market. We ended up losing the bid, only to have the owner come back to us weeks later offering us the home after the first deal fell through. Our move-in date was two months later, in mid-September.</p>
<p>We started out just wanting a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry hook-up</a> in the half-bath. We’d spent years hauling bags to coin laundromats and felt a washer-and-dryer were non-negotiable. But once we started thinking things through, our small project ballooned. We soon realized that both bathrooms needed to be gutted. The full bath had no storage and was on a 10-inch platform to accommodate mid-century plumbing. The half-bath was previously used as a cat’s bathroom, accompanied by a pet door—and a significant odor.</p>

<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten project post</a>, titled “Make These Bathrooms My Favorite Rooms” captured our optimism to transform these small, dismal rooms into a smarter space for our lifestyle and aesthetic taste. So, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose our Sweeten contractor</a>. We didn’t expand either footprint, but were strategic about how each element would really be used, cleaned, and look next to each other.</p>
<p>Overall, we replaced four bathroom and closet doors made of tired, hollow-core faux wood with solid-slab, single-panel Shaker doors. The dark wood floors in the rest of the apartment ground the space and the white walls reflect light. The high-contrast gave us a great foundation for our furniture, textiles, and plants.</p>

<p>We also saw a great opportunity to demo the dining room and envisioned a “great room” with flow between the kitchen, dining, and living rooms where we could host gatherings. After living in claustrophobic rentals, we wanted the first impression to be of openness and light.</p>
<p>Lynn’s background in exhibit design allowed us to renovate without an architect. We measured each wall’s dimension and built a model of the home in <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SketchUp</a>. We could quickly see how to scale any fixtures or make changes. And, the model helped us discuss in more detail with contractors, such as rear-outlet toilets, fixture finishes, grout types, and bath fan sone ratings (for loudness).</p>

<p>The dining room walls were not load-bearing, and there are always surprises when you start opening up floors and walls. When our Sweeten contractor demo’d the dining room walls, he found charred beams in the ceiling from a long-ago fire. We had no idea there had been damage. He reinforced the ceiling with new wood to ensure structural stability.</p>

<p>In the full bathroom, which is 35 square feet, we weren’t sure if we’d be able to drop it down 10 inches. Before we had even hired our contractor, he took out his chisel and broke a peephole into the floor to see what was possible. He gave us confidence that we could make it work, ultimately dropping the entire bathroom, keeping the bathtub at the elevated height, and building out a wall for our new sink and cabinet fixtures.</p>

<p>We included so many details in this bathroom that make all the difference on a day-to-day basis, including a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighted</a> medicine cabinet with outlets inside to allow us to charge our toothbrushes out-of-sight, thereby removing clutter; the near-silent bathroom fan serves as the main light and is hidden without a vent cover; and a wall-hung sink and cabinet allows for more storage and easier cleaning underneath.</p>

<p>As for the half-bath—only 24 square feet—several contractors, who initially inspected the job advised us to forego the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-and-dryer</a> altogether, saying it was impossible, or that we had to tap into our toilet line and disrupt the apartment below. Our Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plumbing team found a simpler solution by tapping into the small sink&#8217;s line. We got a compact, ventless Bosch washer-and-dryer to accommodate the water line, electrical load, and tight space in the bath. Remodeling this room has been a life-changer.</p>
<p>The other issue in this space was the overwhelming odor of cat urine. We tried every odor-reducing spray and paint on the market, and used black lights to expose urination spots, but in the end, we had our contractor gut the walls and floor down to the slab to remove the contaminated wood. Every visit during the renovation had our contractor sniffing in corners, trying to find new origins of contamination. Thankfully, it does not smell like cat pee anymore. We also replaced the dated fixtures in that bath with the smallest toilet and sink we could find.</p>

<p>Overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Our biggest challenge, really, had been finding a contractor. But Sweeten gave us three leads, and our contractor came to the first meeting as if he already had the job, giving realistic explanations for what it would take to accomplish the work. During the renovation, he rarely said no or told us a change wasn&#8217;t possible. As we added to our original scope, he was incredibly flexible and adjusted his timeline and the work to hit our mid-September move-in date. He gave us recommendations when we didn’t know what to buy, explained to us what was needed, and helped us quickly to complete the work.</p>

<p>Sweeten helped us, too, by getting us to clarify our scope and put a realistic budget into our initial post. We learned that even though our timeline was compressed, renovating a home is practically a second job if you undertake it on your own with just a contractor. We now understand why people hire architects. For those with less design experience or who are strapped for time, it would be helpful to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice is if you can do a major renovation before moving in, bite the bullet and get it done. Don’t put off with cleaning the dust later on. We plan to continue renovating in phases, but wanted to get the most disruptive work completed before moving in.</p>
<p>Having gone through four rentals in six years, we always struggled to feel at home. Our new space is beautiful and feels like something we can make our own. We enjoy inviting others into it as often as possible.</p>

<h3>Before: Give a Gramercy bathroom a much-needed facelift for storage, style</h3>
<p>Dated tile (“the bathroom looked like a 1980s Mafia movie!”) and no storage (“with a pedestal sink and no drawers or shelving, we didn&#8217;t even have room to store extra toilet paper”) drove homeowners Jessica and Kevin to finally renovate their bathroom. She’d been living in the 750-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op overlooking Pete&#8217;s Tavern, the oldest tavern in NYC, for seven years. Renovating the bathroom had been on her remodeling bucket list since day one.</p>

<p>After getting married, they used wedding money to fund their renovation, enthusiastic to update the aesthetics by losing the “burnt-red marble, gold hardware, and wall-to-wall mirrors” and adding storage solutions. Jessica <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: A dramatic change resulted when white modern tile replaced the “heinous red marble tile” Jessica still has nightmares about. Their bathroom, which was trapped in an ‘80s vibe, became a calming, minimal space aligned with the couple’s style. The white and pale gray palette lent the former bathroom new life with a spa feel.</p>
<p>The couple replaced the “clunky” bathtub with a modern shower with two heads and switched to chrome fixtures. Next, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackled their storage woes</a>. A console sink with open shelving for towels gave an airy illusion and contributed to the room feeling more spacious.</p>
<p>While designing their new bath space, Jessica was mindful of potential future buyers. She said, “When I bought the apartment, I found it very frustrating there were so many permanent fixtures, including a built-in glass shelf over the toilet, wall-to-wall mirrors, and tile covering most of the walls.&#8221; To give the next homeowners the room to express their own personal touch, she kept the walls painted instead of tiled, installed a mirror that could easily be replaced over the vanity table, and hung two simple towel hooks.</p>

<p>Jessica offered this sage advice, ”If you are purchasing your own materials for the renovation, have it arrive before the start date.” This will help <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid waiting for products to arrive</a> and delaying the project.</p>
<p>Now Jessica calls her new bathroom a happy place and is appreciative of her well-matched contractor. “As with any NYC renovation, you tend to get a lot of complaints about uncontrollable things like dust and loud noise which comes with the territory of living in an apartment building. My Sweeten contractor handled everything like a pro and had much more patience for people than I ever could have exhibited,” she said. “He was extremely flexible and true to his word with regards <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to price and timing of the project</a>.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jessica <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doubled their storage</a> by adding a two-drawer unit under the existing vanity table as well as a cabinet, creating a “personal heaven” she uses every morning to get ready for work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Take notes from these Sweeten renovators, who expertly renovated their homes to get studio apartment storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a studio apartment, closet and storage space is scarce. Your only options for keeping everything in your home are being surrounded by your stuff 24/7 or adopting a minimalist lifestyle and ditching most of your belongings. Neither are perfect solutions. Instead, reimagine the closet, not as a single space where you keep everything, but as multiple spaces throughout your home. Take inspiration from five resourceful renovators who came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors—and see where things can go in a small space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24842 size-chrono" title="bedroom built-in" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>A low cabinet wall can replace closet space for studios</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A low wall of cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew&#8217;s bedroom</a> is the perfect storage alternative to the missing closet, providing ample clothing and shoe storage. Aligning the top of the built-in with the lower half of the window not only keeps it from making the room feel smaller but—<em>voilà!</em>—he now has a window seat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Kitchen cabinetry on a blank wall creates a pseudo pantry &amp; fridge space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Square footage was limited in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren’s tiny kitchen</a>, so she took a blank wall and loaded it up with storage for a hidden pantry and fridge—plus, a coat closet! Tucking everything out of sight provides an uncluttered and sophisticated look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30499 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30500 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Custom wall-hung cabinetry instead of a closet? Yes, please!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of closets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Ian’s studio</a> meant that they had to get creative when it came to clothing storage. A custom walnut cabinet in the bedroom area with a mahogany finish takes advantage of empty wall space and adds some visual interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30000 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30002 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Sleek storage in the living area expertly blends in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ying’s studio</a>, she took the average closet build and turned it inside out, adding cabinet storage, shelving, and drawers along the perimeter of the main living area.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26644 size-chrono" title="custom sliding wardrobe" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A sliding door that doubles as cleverly hidden clothing storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel’s bedroom</a> had a new entryway, but no closet space whatsoever, so he designed a custom sliding door that doubled as wardrobe storage.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Brett</i></span></p>
<h3>In need of something bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way and an energetic dog named Alfie, Terri Lee and Brett Appel needed a larger apartment. The couple had a design advantage from the start: Brett runs his own custom residential architecture practice and Terri works for one of the largest architecture firms in New York. They wanted to find something that they could gut renovate and design to their own specifications.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg" alt="Brett sitting on a chair posing for photo near built-in book shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51517" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A completely gutted remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment was in an 82-unit co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It was in terrible condition, which made it easier to rip everything out and redesign the apartment exactly the way they wanted. They found their contractor after talking with friends (one of whom is also an architect) who <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had used Sweeten</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open living and dining with hardwood floors and white walls and half wall book shelves as room divider or partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51495" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri and Brett posted their project</a> on Sweeten, they were upfront about the existing conditions and scope of work. They wanted a contractor who would tell them whether the work could be done within their budget, or if they needed to scale back. “Fortunately, we found the right contractor who was very happy to work with us so we could get everything we wanted,” Brett said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors and white walls and radiator coverred under large window with black frames and recessed lights after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51493" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Making the space look bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was to combine shades of gray with natural wood to make the home seem as bright and large as possible without being too monotone. “We also didn’t want the renovated space to compete with our brightly colored furniture,” Brett said. Their primary objective in terms of gaining space was to add a second bathroom, which they achieved by rearranging the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg" alt="dining with white walls and ceiling girder and hardwood floors and half wall book shelf divider partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51489" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Challenges in the foyer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry foyer was a bit of a challenge. It’s two steps above the living room and contains the dining space, which was small. They relocated the steps down to the living room from the center to the side and replaced the guardrails with a continuous double-sided built-in bookcase custom-designed by the contractor’s millworker. The raised platform was extended to create a larger dining space, while the closet expanded for more stroller storage. New wide-plank European oak engineered flooring was installed throughout.</p>

<h3>Rearranging the walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they found the apartment, the existing walls were plaster—probably at least 60 years old and poorly done. “One of the walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room was so uneven and bumpy</a>, it looked like it was made out of pillowcases,” Brett recalled. They ultimately decided to fur out the walls–a process to construct a new wall in front of the old one. “We attached 1x3s to the existing wall and then put new sheetrock on those. We lost a little space (about 1 1/2&#8243; per wall), but this saved us about $6,000,” Brett said. The other option to straighten crooked walls would have been &#8220;demolishing the plaster and lathe, placing new studs, and then new sheetrock,&#8221; which would have been more expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Covering the radiator</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet was reframed to function as a walk-in. Other details included the custom radiator covers in the bedroom and living room, crafted by the millworker; leftover stone from the kitchen counters was used for the radiator sills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terri and Brett designed these covers together. The existing radiators had an old painted steel cover that had not weathered very well. The millworker made the slatted fronts on removable clips so the radiator could be accessed for maintenance. The new millwork needed a top/windowsill but the couple decided that painted MDF would not last very long. Brett had to purchase two slabs of stone for the kitchen to cover the countertops and backsplash. There was a lot of leftover stone that easily fit the sills.</p>

<h3>An ADA-compliant layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t have a lot of flexibility designing the kitchen and bathroom layouts. It had to be ADA-compliant since we rearranged everything,” Brett explained. They focused on finishes. In the kitchen, they imagined the countertops and backsplash as the “feature” elements with everything else as the background, &#8220;which is why the floors and cabinets are all different shades of gray,” he said. The couple loves unique, natural stones and found that quartzites have the most movement and veining, which worked well with their gray cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg" alt="gray bathroom floor tiles and white floating vanity with mirror and toilet and bathtub and floor to ceiling wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51516" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Master bath</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were made to seem bigger and brighter by making the walls white and using marble tile in the master and subway tile in the guest. In the master bath, Brett said, he “had some fun connecting the shower niche with the existing windowsill.” Terri scoured the Internet to find an aquatic-themed wallpaper for the guest bathroom. Wood shelves were incorporated in each to provide a little warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brett was most excited about the new rain shower in the added bathroom. “All of my previous apartments—for basically my entire life—only had a bathtub, so it feels very luxurious to shower in a large glass box,” he said.</p>

<h3>A recommendation for clients</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation, Brett had wanted to test out Sweeten’s service to see if he would recommend it to his own clients. After this experience, he said he would. “We didn’t need much assistance from Sweeten because I have experience managing projects like these professionally, but I felt reassured knowing that Sweeten would be able to assist if any serious problems came up. Luckily, our contractor was great and we didn’t have any issues,” Brett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Terri and I are perpetually impressed that we were able to design the apartment exactly to our needs,&#8221; says Brett. &#8220;Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private.&#8221; As an architect couple, they worked well together. &#8220;It helps to come up with a central concept or theme at the beginning,&#8221; Brett said. &#8220;There will always be disagreements but we could then ask ourselves &#8216;does this fit our initial vision&#8217; and make a decision together.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten years ago, Saul and his brother won the lottery. The housing lottery, that is! The prize: a one-bedroom apartment with a terrace in one of New York City’s famed Mitchell-Lama apartments near Manhattan&#8217;s South Street Seaport. (As an affordable housing program started in the mid 20th century, Mitchell-Lama housing ensures that many New Yorkers are able to remain in the city on moderate to middle incomes.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, Saul and his now wife, Kate, lived in the apartment. When the couple left New York, Saul’s brother moved into the apartment with his family. Initially, they didn’t do much to the space, making only cosmetic improvements, updating the carpets, adding some window blinds, and changing out some bath fixtures. Fast forward a decade and the apartment had seen a lot of wear and tear.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before6.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31304 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before6-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31303 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before5-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31306 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31305 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Kate and Saul discovered last year that they would be returning to New York for their jobs—Saul works for a political consulting firm and Kate in international development—they realized that a full renovation was in order before they could live in the apartment again. Saul’s brother, who now has two kids, had long outgrown the space. The kitchen cabinets were falling off their hinges, and the carpets and blinds had not aged well. The bathroom also needed a thorough update. The floors and walls needed to be refreshed. They were also thinking ahead to the eventual resale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the period since Saul and his brother obtained the apartment, the building’s residents had voted to privatize the corporation. Existing residents were given the option of putting in some additional funding in order to buy into the now market-rate, privatized co-op building. This meant that homeowners would eventually be able to sell the apartment on the open market, and when they went to do that, it would be important to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovation that could facilitate resale</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With all of this in mind, Kate and Saul <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, at the suggestion of a co-worker after they experienced a false start with another contractor who did not understand how to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navigate co-op board approvals</a>. Kate admits that they were “not at all good at creative endeavors…it’s hard for us to even hang a photo!” So they knew that they needed some guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to work with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a>, they decided on a clean, subtle palette for the apartment. Kate loves color and pattern and had wanted to incorporate a lot of both, but after talking it through with their contractor, and with resale in mind, she decided that color could be added in less permanent ways. Changing the plumbing locations or adding too much electrical weight to the apartment weren&#8217;t options, given its age and their construction timeline. However, good visual flow from room to room was important, and more than anything, the couple wanted a simple, comfortable space for friends and family to hang out.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31310 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before7-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31344 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31313 mb-0 size-chrono" title="wood-vinyl-floor-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.gif" alt="natural wood vinyl floor with white kitchen cabinets and knobs and silver oven after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As they began, a few hiccups slowed their progress. The building&#8217;s strict requirements meant jumping through multiple hoops for approval, which took months, but their contractor was key in getting them through this process. Next, as they embarked on demolition, workers uncovered asbestos in the floor tiles of the living room, which then had to undergo a full remediation that took two months. The Sweeten contractor addressed these issues as quickly as possible and got them back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31314 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath02-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath07-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31343 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath07-1-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-gray-knob" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" alt="white kitchen cabinets with gray knob and silver appliance along with gray backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In October 2017, the couple moved back to New York and into the apartment. The renovation was not quite done: they didn’t have a door on the bathroom and the kitchen was not yet finished. Their only working sink was in the bathroom. But the contractor worked to complete the kitchen 10 days after they moved back in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wait was well worth it: Kate loves the look of the custom cabinets and was thrilled with the useful storage solutions. They not only have a built-in silverware drawer, but also a corner Lazy Susan and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-out spice rack</a>! The contractor made some minor adjustments to the footprint of the kitchen, removing an old broom closet opposite the refrigerator to make room for a new dishwasher. The other appliances, swapped out for new models, remained in the same spots as their predecessors.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before10-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31322 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before10-1-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31317 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath08-723x1085.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath11.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31318 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-gray-bathroom-vanity-mirror" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath11.gif" alt="white and gray bathroom with long vanity mirror and brushed nickel faucet after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, a gray vanity is set against white subway tile with black accent tiles and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patterned floor</a>. The look is simple but very New York, befitting a downtown apartment. In the rest of the apartment, a light-colored hardwood replaced gray carpeting and subtle colors provide a calming backdrop for an escape from the city streets. All of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets</a> received makeovers, courtesy of the Sweeten contractor’s father, who happened to be a millworker and walked through the apartment with Kate to sketch out her vision of how the closets could be made more practical. Last but not least, they removed the popcorn ceiling and applied three coats of skim coating and painting. The walls also received basic sanding prior to painting. “The ceiling was really a miraculous transformation,” Kate reports. “It totally changed the look of the apartment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking back on the process, Kate shares that she had no experience with design and no background in home improvement, so she was not at all prepared for the work and time it required on a daily basis. She also realized that, as a homeowner, you need to be prepared to explain exactly what you want so that the contractor and his team can execute it: “They aren’t mind-readers!” She met with them each day during the construction to discuss options and make decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the interior of the apartment is done, they are ready to turn their attention to their coveted outdoor terrace in the city! When that time comes, Sweeten is ready to help them &#8220;sweeten&#8221; their outdoors, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Our favorite projects across five neighborhoods</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a population almost as large as Brooklyn, and the biggest footprint of the five boroughs, Queens has a lot to offer. Besides its growing, international food scene, a mix of established neighborhoods and amenity-laden condos, and an influx of tech startups, there&#8217;s the proximity to Manhattan, the U.S. Open tennis tournament, and Citi Field (go Mets!). <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, provides a peek into renovations across the borough, all the way from Long Island City to Ridgewood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28204 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When their tiny, 700-square-foot Manhattan apartment began to feel cramped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah and Craig</a> packed their bags and moved to Long Island City. They found a 1,160-square-foot one bedroom that felt enormous in comparison to their previous digs. At first, the spacious upgrade was more than enough. Four years later, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-to-bottom renovation</a> allowed the couple to transform their home into the stylish and eclectic space that they’d always wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27104 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The very tight kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/">Lisa and Chris’s</a> Kew Gardens co-op made cooking in the space awkward. If you opened the refrigerator door, you’d end up trapping yourself in the kitchen! Converting the wall into a peninsula widened the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a> and increased dining and prep space. With the addition of new cabinets and appliances, the kitchen refresh was just what they needed to enjoy their home again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25185 mb-0 size-chrono" title="apartment flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Housed in the former building of the <em>Ridgewood Times</em> newspaper, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael and Chenta’s</a> loft had deep roots in Queens. A condo conversion in the early aughts—white walls and wood floors—stripped the space of its original, industrial charm. Looking to restore some of that raw quality, the couple ripped up the tired wood floors and exposed the original concrete underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24325 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A long search for a larger space led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan and Cecilia</a> to a mid-century apartment in Elmhurst. With a 25-minute commute to midtown, the location was perfect for them. The 1,300-square-foot, 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op was a true fixer-upper. The couple made changes to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor plan</a> and updated fixtures and finishes in the kitchen, bathrooms, and living areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27494 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="Queens renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> loved their neighborhood of Astoria but needed more space. What the next apartment lacked in style and function it made up for in square footage. They focused their renovation on the kitchen and bathroom—the two spaces that would benefit the most from an upgrade. Custom cabinets, new appliances, and gold pendant lights took the kitchen from drab to fab. In the bathroom, the couple drew design inspiration from their favorite New York City restaurants, installing new fixtures and a fun, pineapple print wallpaper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How a modular closet renovation by Sweeten brought this Upper East Side couple organizational harmony</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jacob-Closet.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31035 mb-0 size-chrono" title="work-in-progress-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jacob-Closet.gif" alt="work in progress in room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When software developer Jacob first purchased his one-bedroom co-op apartment, located on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, in 2017, there were two small closets that he knew could be combined to create a larger, more functional modular closet for himself and his girlfriend, Morgane. As part of an overall refresh of the home, he walks us through the process of how he tackled this aspect of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt_Before01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30826 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt_Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />

<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you decide on the Container Store&#8217;s Elfa System? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> I looked at some of the other options out there but based on my budget and the size of the space, <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/elfa/index.htm#?apos=MB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elfa</a> clearly made the most sense. Also, we had reached a point where the renovation was done, and within two weeks, Morgane and I would be sharing the space almost every weekend, so getting a functioning closet in quickly was a high priority.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Did you design the closet yourself using the online tool or did a representative help you in the store?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> A rep helped in the store, and everyone there was super helpful. Make sure to do a good job of measuring the space ahead of time! Once they know the dimensions, they will ask you several questions about your usage plans for the closet, your wardrobe, etc. After 20 minutes, they have a prototype to make adjustments to, although the initial blueprint was very close to the final design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30935 size-chrono" title="closet rendering" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-1-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30936 size-chrono" title="closet blueprint" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-2-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Jacob&#8217;s closet blueprints</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you decide what mix of elements to include (hanging space, open shelving, drawers, etc.)? </em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> The plan was to create a split usage space for me and Morgane. We would each get two hanging sections and two sets of shelves, and we would share a large section for shoes. One of Morgane&#8217;s hanging sections is double-height for hanging longer items. We have an enormous dresser in the bedroom, so we were able to consider the closet as a space almost exclusively for hanging and shelving.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What did your contractor do to prepare the space for the installation?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten contractor</a> demo&#8217;ed and combined the existing closets. He also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished the floors</a> and walls of the combined space. He left the space open without doors. We used the installer provided by the Container Store’s delivery contractor. It took just a few hours.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Why did you decide to leave the doors off?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> Before, the closet existed as two extremely small separate closets. When combined, the opening was a non-standard width for pretty much every manufacturer we looked at. There is not enough space to the side for a sliding barn door or a pocket door, and Morgane and I both find French doors or folding doors annoying to deal with. Leaving the doors off of the closet actually gave us a lot more flexibility in gaining maximum closet space.</p>

<p><em>As he pointed out, there are many modular closet options out there in addition to <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/elfa/index.htm#?apos=MB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elfa</a>. California Closets is a popular one at a slightly higher price point than Elfa, while <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Storage-Organization/N-5yc1vZc1x1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,<a href="https://www.lowes.com/c/Closet-organization-Storage-organization">Lowe’s</a>, and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a> all have modular closet kits that you can customize to your liking. They are all priced per piece, so you’ll have to buy each shelf, bracket, and track separately. Each of these retailers also offers ready-made sets, however, which can give you a sense of the price range for various setups of different sizes and combinations. In-store representatives can help you tweak your design. Check out what other Sweeten homeowners have done below.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When happily-ever-after meets home renovation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or you’ve owned a home before, taking the plunge and moving in with your partner is both thrilling and terrifying. Throw a renovation into the mix and suddenly the notion of a shared space that’s both personal and cohesive can seem impossible—especially if you’re a first-time renovator as well. Take heart that it can be done. Read on to meet five couples who combined romance and renovation with help from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Amy_and_Nick_Apartment.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30655 size-chrono" title="Amy and Nick" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Amy_and_Nick_Apartment-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26525 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First-time homeowners and renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Nick</a> wanted to avoid a renovation at all costs. Things changed when they came across an outdated 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that was just the right size and layout for them to imagine their home together. The couple moved in and started saving for a renovation. While remodeling, they refreshed the worn-out bath and tore out the triangular-shaped kitchen, replacing it with new cabinets, appliances, and a custom 10-foot-long island topped with sparkling Carrara marble. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. “We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29012 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29015 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These homeowners</a> spent a year dreaming about the possibilities of renovating their two-bedroom co-op in Brooklyn—their first as a couple—before they kicked things off by hiring a general contractor. Despite the many windows and breathtaking views of the city, the apartment felt crowded and closed-off. They opened up the layout by removing the wall separating the kitchen from the living room and installed an island—a feature that they had both loved from their childhood kitchens. The changes improved the overall flow and flooded the space with sunlight. Creative choices—from the bright green backsplash in the kitchen to the warm gold fixtures in the bath—allowed them to inject their personality into the space.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua</a>, a newly engaged couple, planned on transforming Erica’s apartment—the home she had grown to love, despite its quirks, over the past 10 years—into the perfect space to begin their new lives together. The renovation focused on opening up and updating the kitchen. &#8220;We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy,&#8221; says Erica. Custom cabinets replaced builder-grade cabinetry and a new peninsula provided generous storage and a place for the duo to dine. &#8220;Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet. I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree,&#8221; she said. After speaking to their contractor, &#8220;Joshua was right. The floors needed to be replaced.&#8221;<span class="s1"> </span>The apartment is now cozy—instead of cramped—and overflowing with natural light. At the end of the renovation, Erica found that there was so much more to love about her home.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becky and Sarah</a> moved in together with the intention of renovating their kitchen, but the project was put on hold. When it came time to renovate, the planning stage involved a few different versions until they settled on the right design; an open kitchen with shelves instead of upper cabinets. To make sure there was enough storage, they installed an island with pull-out drawers and nestled the fridge within cabinetry. While the project was stressful at times, the results were well worth the effort. Once the punch list was complete, the couple got engaged. “It could have torn us apart but in the end it bonded us together,” said Sarah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24316 size-chrono" title="Jonathan and Cecilia" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24325 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While searching for their first home together, Cecilia was looking for a place within walking distance of shops and subway stations, while Jonathan wanted a fixer-upper with plenty of square footage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple</a> combined their requirements and fed the list into a computer code that Jonathan had written to find his first apartment. The code scoured real estate websites and narrowed down the results so that they only looked at the ones that met their needs. Renovating their home led them to a unified design for the main living spaces, while also allowing them to create their own spaces where it mattered the most: in this case, his and her bathrooms.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30234 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For 18 years, home for JoAnn and Brian was a 6-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot Colonial in Chesterfield, New Jersey. As they neared retirement, however, they decided that they wanted to move to Manhattan—a lifelong desire. Their daughter was living in New York City, and the couple already owned an investment property in the Turtle Bay neighborhood that could be converted to their primary residence. The apartment, a one-bedroom co-op measuring 600 square feet, had been rented out for over a decade.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30237 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30236 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bath and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was tired and worn, and “totally not my style,” says JoAnn. “The kitchen was completely outdated and ugly. I like to cook and wanted more storage and a larger work area. I needed room for all my appliances and a large countertop for prepping. We didn’t add more appliances, though, just bought new and better-quality ones.” The kitchen was walled off from the living area and the entryway with narrowly-arched pass-throughs, which made the space feel smaller than it actually was. The plan for the bathroom, which required a refresh, was to swap out the tub for a large walk-in shower. Storage was to be incorporated throughout the home wherever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30240 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30241" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As experienced renovators (with four renovations under their belts!), JoAnn and Brian knew it would be beneficial to hire a licensed contractor who was experienced with local rules and regulations. Since their contacts were all in New Jersey, they were at a loss for where to turn. Then, one day while they were watching the Sunday morning news, they saw a commercial for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. “We immediately <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filled out the easy online form</a> and were matched with three different contractors. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After meeting our Sweeten contractor</a>, we knew right away we wanted to work with him. This turned out to be our best decision!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo got to work on a design with their contractor that would allow them to downsize comfortably from a six-bedroom house to a one-bedroom apartment (no easy feat). Their biggest concern was storage. Their Sweeten contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigned the existing closets</a> to maximize usable area and even found a place to add a new closet in the hallway adjacent to the master bedroom. To keep the apartment “simple, so it doesn’t feel too crowded,” says JoAnn, the kitchen counter stools swivel toward the living room and act as additional seating. A pull-out sofa in the living room does double duty for overnight guests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, their Sweeten contractor took all of JoAnn and Brian’s ideas and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a space</a> with the prep surfaces they needed, while also housing their cooking tools. They chose to leave the footprint as it was, changing out everything else. Rental-grade cabinetry was replaced with custom Shaker-style cabinetry in two tones.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30243" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along the back wall, which holds the new Bertazzoni stove, Bosch dishwasher, and Liebherr refrigerator, the cabinetry is floor-to-ceiling white. The peninsula sports a dark wood for contrast. Both sides are topped with white Caesarstone counters. Glass subway tile backsplash and a larger-format gray tile on the floors complete the look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30260 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before08-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before08" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30247 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store11" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30248" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store13" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bath, out went the old tub. In its place, their Sweeten contractor installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a> divided from the rest of the bath with a piece of frameless glass for a more open feel. Gray mosaic tiles in complementary shapes—a hex in the shower and a weave in the rest of the room—were chosen for floors. White subway tile on the walls kept things simple, and a modern vanity provided much-needed storage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30246 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30249" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next to the vanity, the contractor found room behind the wall, so he opened it up to add floor-to-ceiling built-in shelving, which JoAnn and Brian use for toiletries and small decorative objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom and living room were overhauled with new paint and doors. Yet another archway leading from the bedroom area to the living room was removed for more airiness overhead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30250" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They reported a seamless experience working with their Sweeten contractor: “We sent him many pictures of what we liked and he really paid attention,&#8221; said JoAnn. &#8220;We are extremely happy with all the choices. Their work ethic was exemplary. They showed up on time and made themselves available when we needed them. They were conscious of our budget. The contractor and his team were very respectful to our neighbors so as not to disturb anyone. They kept everything neat and orderly. Our apartment was completed in a timely fashion and exceeded our expectations!”</p>
<p><em>Thanks, JoAnn and Brian, for sharing your new Manhattan &#8220;nest&#8221; with us.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade ago, Ying and her parents purchased an investment property on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It was a prewar studio apartment, perfect for a young professional right out of college. Ying made it her home for a couple of years and then moved on to another apartment in the East 60s that was better suited to her needs. The studio became a rental apartment for several years and cycled through three different tenants until it hit the rental limits under co-op rules. By this time, Ying had moved to Portland, Oregon, where she currently works in communications, but she and her parents still made frequent visits to New York City. They envisioned renovating the space to create a comfortable second home for themselves on those occasions.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. Ying knew that she needed a contractor she could trust to manage the project since she wouldn’t be on site and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to Sweeten’s website. Her plans included new paint, lighting, and flooring, as well as comprehensive custom built-ins along several walls and a brand-new spa bathroom. This<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten contractor</a> turned out to be the right one for the job, and he quickly got to work after discussing Ying’s vision with her over phone and email. She shared her <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a> board with him, and told him that her goals were to “streamline the entrance [by] knocking out that closet there, and leverage the blank wall as storage to make the studio look cleaner and give it more room.” Ying was inspired by the techniques used by designers of tiny houses, where “every corner is maximized.” The Sweeten contractor was in total agreement after seeing the space, and produced a proposal with the intention of achieving a look that was “fresh, clean, and simple.”</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, they reconfigured the space by the entrance to create a small dining nook. Ying chose a rift oak wood veneer for the custom cabinetry, paired off with brushed nickel handles with squared-off edges. There’s no longer any need for storage furniture, since the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> accommodate space for hanging clothes as well as shelving, and anything else one might need on a short trip to the city. On the floors, Ying went with a prefinished maple in a light stain. To contrast, the new lighting fixtures were matte black with modern lines, which tied in with the existing black window frames.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hex-tiles-and-subway-wall-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49169 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="White bathroom with white subway tiles and contrasting gray grouting with slate colored hex tiles in shower and bathroom after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Ying’s favorite part of the renovation, the end result was one befitting a luxurious pied-à-terre. The tub was traded out for a walk-in shower with frameless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass walls and doors</a>, and outfitted with white subway tile and contrasting gray grout. A slate-colored hex tile was added to the floor of both the shower and the bathroom (in different sizes). A custom vanity was installed with a white Thassos marble countertop.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ying credits the great communication and management skills of her Sweeten contractor for getting the job done right. She has a self-professed obsession with attention to detail but knew that she would have to trust her team given that she was directing the project remotely. “They were really good at keeping me up to speed. They shared images of the ongoing renovation. We were in contact weekly. While the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-op took a LONG time</a> to get back to us on the paperwork, my contractor was instrumental in helping chase them down.” Ying adds, “I think that it helped from a design and reno perspective that I was never breathing down their necks. Pick a team you can trust to bring your aesthetic to life. And don’t feel worried about voicing your opinions—you are the client, after all! But be respectful; you are both working on the same project!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A change of plans results in a home to grow into for the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Melissa and Blake were on the hunt for a two-bedroom apartment in their beloved neighborhood of Gramercy for years with little to no luck. When the search felt hopeless, they readjusted their expectations, setting their sights on large, one-bedroom units that could be renovated to fit their needs. Fortunately, the new angle proved successful, and the couple came across an older co-op with good bones and plenty of windows and storage, providing them with the perfect canvas to shape their new home. Read on for Melissa’s take on their resourceful home renovation!</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28650 size-feature" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-936x667.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been looking for a two-bedroom apartment under $1 million for years. We knew that for that price, we&#8217;d need to find a “wreck” and fix it up, but we weren’t willing to compromise on location, lots of windows, air conditioners that were NOT in the window, good closet space, a doorman, an elevator, reasonable maintenance, and as much square footage as we could get. Pretty much impossible. But when we started looking at large one-bedrooms that we could convert to a two-bedroom, we began to see a few possibilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we got had everything we wanted except that it had lime-green walls with dark green moldings everywhere (except in the pink bedroom; it had rose-colored moldings), an original ‘50s-style bathroom and kitchen, and a huge closet (3’ deep x 7’ long) added to a wall right as you walked into the apartment.</p>

<blockquote><p>None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any contractors they had used.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started looking for contractors right away to get an idea of cost. None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any they had used. One Sunday morning, we were watching NBC’s &#8220;Open House&#8221; and saw an ad for Sweeten. We did some research online and everyone who used the site seemed really happy with the results. We liked the fact that they did background checks on the contractors and had reviews from other people who had actually used the contractor. There was nothing to lose, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our job</a> to be matched.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We met with three contractors (all responded to us within hours) and learned something from every one of them. We hadn’t thought about the floors (they needed to either be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replaced or refinished</a>), <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doors </a>(they were all hollow and flimsy), or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">electrical wiring</a> (some of the ceiling fixtures were not exactly “legal”). The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one we chose was the last contractor we met with</a> and spent the most time with probably because we knew he was the “one.” We explained what we wanted to do and he responded with what was possible, what was necessary, what choices we had to save money, and what we would regret not doing. He took our “vision” for the kitchen and prepared plans that we all reworked until they were right. Our list got longer and our budget got larger, but thanks to his experience, we felt confident the right choices were being made. He also has a kitchen and bath showroom, where we picked out most of our materials with considerable help and advice from him and his office administrator Dede.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At our closing, we had all the materials needed for the co-op board’s renovation package done and ready to be filed. Our contractor had a lot of experience renovating NYC co-ops and knew all the insurance, licensing, and millions of details that are involved with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">board submissions</a>. His office administrator was on top of everything and made that part of the process a breeze. There was some back and forth with the co-op manager and their architects approving the job—July and August may not have been the best time to get approvals when the world is on vacation!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally started at the end of August and moved in the first week of November, although the guys didn’t completely finish until mid-November. Our contractor’s crew, run by his brother Benny, were all such great guys. They were at the site every day, all day, working hard, so progress was easy to see. They never left without cleaning and mopping. They were very considerate of our neighbors throughout the renovation. Our new building super stopped by from time to time to check on the work and told us he was impressed with the quality of their efforts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28649 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-10" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28648" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we love about our new apartment is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan</a> that resulted from tearing out the big closet and the walls surrounding the kitchen and connecting the kitchen to the living room. The whole place is brighter now with the light from the kitchen window. We have so much more space with a bar and stools and lots of cabinets. The tile backsplash, counters, and floors are different textures and work really well with the white cabinets, decisions we made with lots of advice from our contractor! We opted to do some things ourselves. We bought closet interiors for the bedroom and front hall closets from Ikea, put them together, and our contractor bolted them into the wall. We purchased custom radiator covers online and assembled them ourselves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28653 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28896" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt07.gif" alt="SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space is still a one-bedroom for now, but it’s designed in such a way that if we need an extra bedroom in the future, we can easily add a wall to the end of the L-shaped living space (which already has its own closet, too). The Ikea <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bedroom closet</a> was a big investment of time that totally paid off. It&#8217;s 11 feet of closet with hanging space, drawers, and interior lights. The three huge sliding doors let us keep it two-thirds open at any one time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28656 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28655" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom has a frameless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass tub enclosure</a>, letting in lots of light. Our contractor helped us choose the tiles and recommended the new silver edging, which looks great, as well as the wood-like tile for the floor. We found our bathroom vanity on sale and we ended up with a free bathtub! The tub we ordered was delivered and installed, but the protective paper-surround stayed on until the bathroom was finished. When the paper came off, we saw they had sent the wrong tub. Since it was already installed, the company gave us the only remedy left—a free tub!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Client services at Sweeten checked in with us periodically throughout the whole renovation and were available by phone when we needed them. When the job was finished, we submitted a review of our contractor that we hope helps other people trying to decide on their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, our “wreck” became a beautiful, bright, modern home where we like to cook together and have friends over, and we feel very comfortable here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Some of our favorite projects, big and small, in this booming neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the Barclays Center on the north end and the farmer’s market at the Grand Army Plaza on the south end, Brooklyn&#8217;s Prospect Heights has something for everyone. From its historic architecture to its tree-lined streets, and with close proximity to Manhattan, it’s no wonder so many Sweeten renovators call it home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joel and Eric already lived in the neighborhood (and loved it!), but ended up expanding their search for a larger apartment to include neighborhoods from Hamilton Heights to Jackson Heights and Brooklyn Heights. After a long search, they found what they were looking for&#8230;in the building next door. The one-bedroom, located in the heart of Prospect Heights, was brimming with potential. Its kitchen, with its dark cabinetry and metallic silver walls, was swapped for a more modern palette, including white, charcoal gray, and wood tone for added warmth. The pièce de résistance, a custom, wraparound counter that joins the kitchen to the living room, makes it easy to entertain.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20293 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-new-kitchen-makes-way-for-two-new-arrivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Oleg’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The small galley kitchen in Sarah and Oleg’s one-bed, one-bath co-op had always bothered them. They knew they wanted to do something with it someday. Thinking of growing their family, “someday” became “right away,” and the couple turned to a full kitchen renovation that would also convert their dining area into a nursery. The space opened up, allowing the kitchen to become a U-shape, and bright white cabinets replaced the old, wood tone ones. And just in time for two new arrivals (twins!), the dining area was closed off as a separate bedroom with sliding doors. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marissa’s one-bed, one-bath co-op hadn’t been touched since the early &#8217;80s, and it showed. Persistent leaks, dropped ceilings, and builder-grade fixtures made the space feel neglected and unloved. Drawing inspiration from her six-year-long career as an off-Broadway lighting designer, Marissa planned a dramatic makeover for the space. Black paint paired with white subway tile provides contrast while a petite, crystal-adorned chandelier adds a touch of glam. The finished space is smart, sophisticated, and wildly popular on Sweeten&#8217;s social media.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for a bigger home led Kaija and John to a one-bed, one-bath co-op in Prospect Heights. The priority was finding a sizable kitchen, one that could hold all of their appliances, including the ones that had been shipped and stored in Kaija’s parent’s basement in Minnesota. A gut renovation of their new kitchen was deemed necessary. The project centered on removing a half wall and creating a custom island with enough storage to stash an arsenal of kitchen gadgets. Inspired by the look of cement, the couple chose poured concrete for the island’s countertop. The addition of open shelves allowed them to put some of their larger appliances—like their attractive stand mixer—on display.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26525 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy and Nick’s kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First-time homeowners Amy and Nick wanted to buy in Brooklyn but didn’t want a space that needed a lot of work. That changed when they came across a two-bed, one-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that felt perfect for them. The first step was to free the kitchen from the triangular nook it was trapped in. Combining the kitchen and living room gave the kitchen plenty of room to grow. Aiming to create a space that would be ideal for both cooking and entertaining, a supersized kitchen island was installed and topped with Calacatta gold marble. Now the kitchen is the couple’s favorite spot to hang out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple reconfigures their living space for a new family addition</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Idalee, Danny, and baby" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-01-723x526.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="526" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When work started, Idalee, 25 weeks pregnant, and her husband, Danny, had a natural deadline to turn their one-bedroom apartment into two bedrooms. Previously, the couple, along with their dog Maxie, squeezed into a studio for four years to save for their first home purchase. They found themselves leaning towards co-op buildings in Clinton Hill, which provided larger living spaces as well as more modern features (at least more modern than a prewar apartment). “We fell in love with the neighborhood and the flexibility the spaces had with converting the apartments,” said Daniel. That was in 2015. Since then they have been planning their renovation as well as starting a family.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27588 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before-723x482.jpg" alt="before" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27874 size-chrono" title="new floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="new floor plan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a>The goal of the renovation was to simultaneously create a nursery from a small dining space off the living room while opening up the apartment to be more conducive to entertaining, as well as fix water-damaged floors. They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor from Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. “We wanted to optimize the small square footage of the space and ideally achieve unobstructed sightlines throughout,” said Daniel. The couple was intent on incorporating a mid-century look in the decor and furniture. Above all, they needed to do all this within their budget and in time for the baby’s arrival. They were fortunate enough to live with family nearby, “but we can’t imagine what things would have been like if we had to live in the space during the renovation,” said Daniel. The close proximity allowed them to check in on the progress of their renovation about once a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/brooklyn-couple-adds-nursery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was the biggest part of the renovation. In the original design, a cupboard stood between the kitchen and the living space. As glorious as storage is in an apartment, it had to be sacrificed in order to connect the kitchen to the living room. Luckily, there was dead space near the front door entryway and the couple’s Sweeten contractor was able to carve out a storage closet. Huge drawers in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a>, as well as cabinets that went to the ceiling, also made up for lost storage. And of course, “a little <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/marie-kondo-closet-organizing-cleaning-konmari-spark-joy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Kondo</a>-style purging” helped limit what actually needed to be stored.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing kitchen aesthetic was bland with pine cabinets and a sad beige countertop. For the new look, Daniel and Idalee went for a modern and industrial design that would blend with the more mid-century look of the living room in a color mix of white and grays. This was reflected in the kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tiles</a>, where the couple had a bit of fun. “I would say that our kitchen floors are one of our favorite aspects,” said Daniel, ”since we didn’t think we would be able to accomplish a mosaic tile floor with our budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an added bonus, the Sweeten contractor found a hidden power outlet near the kitchen window. “My husband does a lot of cooking and having an outlet allows us to use a fan to help regulate the temperature in the apartment,” said Idalee. Their contractor also helped the duo decide where new power sources should go, especially since walls and outlets were removed during the renovation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Daniel and Idalee worked with their architect Robert to place the walls and convert the dining room into a nursery. They opted for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass doors</a> to let the maximum amount of light into the living room. The glass also meant that they could keep an eye on their newborn child from the next room. “When he gets older, we will put a curtain on the inside of the door that he can control and can ideally still let light through during the day,” said Idalee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The area near the front door with the new storage closet also needed a railing because of the lowered entryway. &#8220;We always knew we needed to add one when we had a child, so we included this as part of our renovation,&#8221; said Idalee. &#8220;The railing works great to section off the side of the stairs.&#8221; They also added a small white bench under the railing as a sitting area for putting shoes on and off. &#8220;It feels like a small mud room to us, which is nice to have in a small city apartment,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27565 size-chrono" title="the family in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-723x482.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27568 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-15-723x482.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>  Water damage to the original parquet floors needed to be fixed. With a little bit of luck, a neighbor who was also renovating was able to donate some old flooring to replace the damaged section. However, matching the rest of the older floor while patching up the problem area would be near impossible. Instead, the couple decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> the floors and change the shade from a golden oak to a dark walnut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To find their stellar Sweeten contractor, Daniel and Idalee had some help from Sweeten Client Services; their advisor also offered to join phone calls with the couple and potential contractors. “We really can’t say enough about how great it was using the Sweeten service,” said Daniel. “Sweeten is certainly a fan favorite among the Clinton Hill co-ops.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though their renovation ran on time and within budget, it certainly was “nothing like you see on HGTV,” said Daniel. The one piece of advice the couple would give to those embarking on a renovation is simple: plan properly and start early.</p>
