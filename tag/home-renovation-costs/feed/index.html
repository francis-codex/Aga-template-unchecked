			<h2>Here&#8217;s what influences full-home renovation costs in NYC — from permits and construction to hidden costs</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50473 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lexi-LivingRoom-04-2.jpg" alt="NYC renovation costs" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lexi-LivingRoom-04-2.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lexi-LivingRoom-04-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lexi-LivingRoom-04-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Click to read our most up-to-date NYC <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitchen Remodeling Costs here</a> and NYC <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs here</a></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Sweeten general contractors, the typical price range for an entire home remodel in NYC is <b>$100 to $200 per square foot (psf)</b>. </span><span class="s1">This standard starting range includes both labor and materials, and represents costs averaged across both “wet” spaces, like <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">bathrooms</span></a> and<a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"> kitchens</span></a>, and “dry” spaces, like living rooms, bedrooms, and offices. This is because wet space remodels tend to be far more expensive per square foot, with a higher density of materials, finishes, and specialized labor (think plumbing, tiling, and more). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a more specific breakdown of typical NYC home renovation costs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/">Full-home renovation</a> in NYC: <b>$100—$200 psf</b> </span>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Dry spaces: <b>$30–$50 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Wet spaces: Baths start at<b> $400 psf; </b>kitchens start at <b>$300 psf</b> </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Gut remodel with stock materials:<b> $100–$200 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Non-gut remodel with stock materials:<b> $100 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Gut remodel with customization:<b> $200–$300 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Non-gut remodel with customization:<b> $200 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Structural changes, extensive customization:<b> $300 psf </b>and<b> up</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: From<b> $2,000–</b><b>$5,000</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Electrical permits:<b> $900</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500–$1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><b>Scheduling tip:</b> Don&#8217;t wait. There&#8217;s a backlog in the supply of construction materials. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/">schedule and sign with a contractor</a> to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost for a gut renovation vs. a non-gut</span></h3>
<p class="p1">As you <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan out your home remodel</a>, there’s a difference in cost, process, and scope between a gut and non-gut project. <span class="s1">In a gut renovation, interior walls are stripped down to the studs or knocked out entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A gut will start at the higher end of the <b>$100 </b>to<b> $200 psf </b>range, while a renovation in which you redo the space within the existing walls will be on the lower end. For example, in a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment, a renovation will come in around the <b>$50,000</b> to <b>$70,000</b> range, while a gut renovation will likely exceed <b>$100,000</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The non-gut renovation may involve a new kitchen and bath, as well as refinishing flooring, replastering and <span class="s2">painting</span>, plus upgrades in materials and finishes. The gut renovation will include the above as well as replacing the walls and flooring, and possibly installing new piping and wiring systems and moving doorways.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49030 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation costs" width="1000" height="745" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1-600x447.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given that New York City apartments vary widely and can present unique challenges, a per-square-foot estimate is really a ballpark figure for you to get started. Here’s an overview:</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Basic costs for an NYC home renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When estimating price per square foot, the scope of work usually includes the following:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Basic demolition </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Framing: the skeletal, load-bearing structure to which the interior walls and other systems are attached </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Insulation and drywall </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Wiring, including outlets and switches </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Plumbing </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Heating/cooling systems </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">All visible materials and fixtures in kitchens and baths (described below) </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t include appliances. Also bear in mind that the choices you make for visible materials—tile, flooring, millwork, paint, lighting fixtures, electronics, and more—can significantly affect the price of your renovation.</span></p>
<h4>At the $100 to $200 psf range:</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Materials are generally prefabricated or stock items and in finishes that are available at common retail outlets. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Cabinets in this price range are typically MDF (medium-density fiberboard). </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Tiling will run under <b>$10</b> <b>psf</b>. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Lighting will be standard but solid basics. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Solid wood floors may be shorter, narrower planks made of less expensive woods. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">The work will be careful, clean, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/home-remodel-bay-ridge-brooklyn-pre-war-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-installed at this level</a> with higher quality labor and skillsets at the upper end of the range. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">At <b>$200</b> to <b>$300</b> <b>psf </b>range:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Some customization on details such as joints, millwork, and hardware</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Cabinets are custom or semi-custom and can include built-ins. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countertops in natural stone or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-quality manufactured materials.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"> Solid, wide-planked hardwood flooring</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Projects at this price point are not usually gut renovations, but rather remodels that focus on the space within the existing walls.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">One thing to note</span><span class="s1">: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote</span><span class="s5">.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">What you’ll get for <b>$300 per square foot</b> and higher:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>$300</b> <b>psf</b> or above will usually pay for layout changes or structural work, such as <span class="s3">combining apartments</span>. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving walls, adding staircases, shifting gas and plumbing, and electrical rewiring all contribute to a higher per-square-foot cost, as well as add to the behind-the-scenes expenditures (more on that below). </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Since pricing for kitchens and baths runs higher than other rooms, more of those equal a higher price per square foot. For example, renovating a 1,000-square-foot apartment that has three bathrooms will be more expensive than an apartment of the same size with just one bathroom.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this level and beyond, you can expect to see more extensive customization, fine finishes, and luxurious materials. This includes handmade tile, exotic wood grains, natural stone, and custom millwork details that complement the home’s architecture. You might also see custom door casements and extensive lighting details.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Design</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on your general contractor and your level of involvement in the project, you may also want or need professional design services. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">You may need an architect. Architect approvals are required any time you make changes to the structure or to plumbing or gas lines. Many Sweeten general <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors in NYC</a> can refer architects for your project.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">You may consider a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">design/build firm</span></a>, which combines design and construction services within one fee and contract. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Building and city requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a co-op or condo building, you’ll likely need to submit your plans drawn by an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">architect</span></a> to your building’s board. Co-ops are generally stricter about renovations than condo buildings, though many condos are now adopting more stringent rules as well. Buildings may also have minimum requirements for construction insurance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some alteration agreements require a security deposit to cover potential damage. They may also include the fees incurred by the condo or co-op board to review and approve your plan. You may find that contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive specifications have higher rates in order to meet higher insurance requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NYC Department of Buildings requires that you obtain permits and inspections for many types of construction work, including plumbing, electrical, and structural. Permits can add up. An electrical permit can run close to <b>$900</b>, plumbing permits can cost from under <b>$2,000</b> to <b>$5,000</b>, and an asbestos inspection can be <b>$500</b>.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Demolition and site prep</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the state of the original space, you may need to do extensive preparatory work after demolition and before installation. Older apartments will almost always require stripping, leveling, and plastering. Uneven floors and walls must be leveled before cabinets can be hung, doors framed, or tiling installed. These costs are determined by the general contractor once they have a chance to examine your space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Behind-the-scenes costs</span></h4>
<p>Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as t<span class="s1">he main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts, from what we have seen,&#8221; said an NYC Sweeten contractor. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compared to costs for the &#8220;visible&#8221; parts of your renovation, pricing for the &#8220;unseen” costs can be difficult to anticipate. While labor is a clear one, keep in mind that different forms of labor can be priced very differently. Wiring and plumbing work, for example, tend to be expensive. And over the past year, master plumbers and electricians have seen costs go up, “primarily due to the safety measures and certifications that have been imposed on these trades by the Department of Buildings,” said <span class="s3">Sweeten</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">NYC general contractor Aaron</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plumbing generally runs between <b>$1,500</b> to <b>$2,000</b> per fixture in New York City. So, prepare for at least <b>$5,000</b> for a licensed plumber to run new lines for a sink, toilet, and bathtub. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Skim coating,</span></a><span class="s3"> a technique</span> that smoothes a wall, hiding all imperfections, is the most expensive type of labor. In some cases, it can be more affordable to tear down old walls and put up new drywall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider that from the contractor’s perspective, “labor” on the budget proposal may include not only the hourly rate they pay their workers, but also insurance, license, and other overhead fees that keep their business running. (Contractors typically take home 10-15% profit. For example, if they do $2 million worth of business this year, they are netting about $200k.) Insurances and other costs of running a business increase year over year, and while the costs are not passed 1:1 to the client, contractors must raise prices to maintain operations. Some show a specific line on the budget for profit/overhead, while others build it into other budget lines.</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Tips on how to budget your NYC home renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you’ve accounted for each line item in your budget, allocate an additional 10 to 15 percent as a cushion. Projects can run over budget as a result of unforeseen circumstances, so it’s good to err on the safe side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many factors go into the per-square-foot estimates. Trying to come up with a plan to match your budget? Here are some tips from contractors and renovating homeowners:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Mix high and low.</b> This refers to materials, which should be selected for maximum impact. You may choose a handmade tile for the kitchen backsplash while sticking to an off-the-shelf option for the second bath. Make a custom statement where it will really get noticed, and use standard materials where it won’t.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Don’t skimp on plumbing and electrical infrastructure.</b> Although these aspects probably won’t get you many compliments at a dinner party, you still need licensed and qualified experts for these jobs. If you don’t, there may be expensive problems to deal with in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Focus on kitchens and baths.</b> Spend your money here! A <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen upgrade</a> and a refreshed bathroom have the most resale value impact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Consult experts upfront.</b> If you are inclined to hire an architect or designer for a major transformation, get them on board early. This can save money by mapping out a clear plan, helping you avoid costly changes mid-stream. Set aside 15 to 20 percent of your budget for this professional. In general, hiring licensed professionals early is a cost-effective way to prevent insurance headaches later on by using their expertise to avoid mistakes that can lead to delays.</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1"></span></a></p>

			<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639032991721"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u><strong><u>How much does a gut renovation cost in New York City?</u></strong></u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">An average full-home renovation in NYC will cost between $100-200 per square foot. A gut renovation will start at the higher end of the $100-$200 psf range. “Wet spaces” with plumbing have higher gut costs: kitchens will cost, on average, $300 per square foot, and bathrooms, $400 psf. Gut renovating dry spaces without plumbing will cost between $30–$50 psf.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639033036055"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in NYC?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">The visible parts of a bathroom—tile, sinks, vanities, tubs/showers—will directly impact end costs, as will the type of work being done (gut renovation vs. rip-and-replace.) In New York City, a budget remodel of a bathroom will start at $600 psf; or $21,000 for a 35 square-foot space. Mid-grade bathrooms start at $700 psf, or $24,500 for a 35 square-foot space. High-end remodels will start at $850 psf, or $68,000 for an 80 square-foot space.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639033047979"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What renovations increase NYC home value the most?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Kitchen and bathroom renovations have the most resale value in NYC homes. Even doing a more budget-friendly “rip-and-replace” renovation (where old appliances and cabinets are swapped out for new ones, with no changes made to the room layout,) can lead to returns when selling in the competitive NYC housing market.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Boston </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p><span class="s1">From brownstones to grand Victorians and Federals, all the way to modern apartments, Boston has it all, when it comes to homes. There’s a good reason for that. Boston is one of the oldest cities in America—circa 1630—and has cycled through many eras. </span><span class="s1">If you’re planning to remodel your home and want to learn about the various costs to remodel in Boston, then Sweeten should be your first stop. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, offers </span><span class="s1">a general cost guide to get you started on your first step: your budget. However, to get an accurate figure for your project, a contractor will want to see the space in person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: Starting at around <strong>$100</strong> psf (per square foot)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$65,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000</strong>—<strong>$18,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$27,000</strong> or <strong>$770</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end master bathroom remodel and reconfiguration: Starting at <strong>$50,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Basement: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="s1">How much a Boston remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Boston that brings your home down to its frame will likely start at around <strong>$100</strong> psf. Doing it all at once will get you the best price per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Boston predominantly older—in some cases very old—housing stock, gut renovations may be higher than elsewhere with newer homes. Depending on the area, your choice in finishes, and the condition of your home or apartment, this could reach $300 psf, according to Boston-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6981#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Taghi</a>. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48197" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="710" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts--300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts--600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Boston kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The typical renovation cost for a minor kitchen in Boston starts at <strong>$15,000</strong> and goes up to <strong>$30,000</strong>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen: For the Boston area, expect costs to start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s 2020 Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">report</span></a> puts the average mid-grade kitchen renovation cost around <strong>$80,000</strong>. This is about <strong>$10,000</strong> above the national average and works out to be <strong>$400</strong> psf. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with laminate countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">Other than<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3"> adding a kitchen island</span></a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher were installed, remained the same as the original design. Keeping your floor plan the same will be the biggest factor in keeping your budget down.<br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1">High-end kitchen: High-end kitchen remodels can start at <b>$65,000</b> while the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">report</span></a> places the average around <strong>$155,000</strong> for Boston. The cost per square foot is <strong>$775</strong>. This type of project can add more than half that amount—<strong>$85,000</strong>—to your home’s value. The scope at the budget range can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances were also kicked up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. Designer faucets and a water filtration system were also part of the materials.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabinets are by far the biggest expense in a kitchen especially when they are custom made. According to Boston-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7012#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Jeff</a>, one client chose to spend <strong>$35,000</strong> on cabinets—almost half the whole budget—in an <strong>$80,000</strong> renovation of a small kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appliances are also a big factor in the budget if you decide to spend a large percentage here and save in other areas.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Boston bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The typical home renovation cost for a budget bathroom in Boston starts at <strong>$15,000</strong> and goes up to <strong>$18,000</strong>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom: For Boston, the average cost of a mid-grade bathroom remodel is about <strong>$27,000</strong> or <strong>$770</strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <span class="s3">report</span>. This budget could get you a remodeled 35-square-foot bathroom with a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add more than <strong>$16,000</strong> to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home’s value, recouping close</a> to 60 percent of the project’s cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end master bathroom: Renovation costs start at <strong>$50,000</strong> for a high-end master bath in Boston. According to Cost Vs Value,  the average price is around <strong>$82,000</strong> or <strong>$820</strong> psf. You could afford to expand your existing bathroom from 35 square feet to around 100 square feet and play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You’re also likely to afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like all renovations, your budget comes down to your choices, said contractor Jeff. And sometimes those choices will have a ripple effect on the budget. Tiles can range from <strong>$2</strong> psf at Home Depot or <strong>$100</strong> psf for imported tile. The cost and timeline can increase if the tile chosen requires specialized installation such as Italian mosaic tile which one of Jeff’s clients ordered.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much it costs to renovate a basement</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">A basement renovation starts at <strong>$25,000</strong>. The average cost is <strong>$88,000</strong>, the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/new-england/boston-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">report</span></a> found. </span><span class="s2">The project for this budget includes a 20′ x 30′ main room and a 5′ x 8′ bathroom with a shower. The main room can contain a bar area as well as laminate flooring and insulation, a largely unseen but important part of the project to combat those wet, frosty winters. This example project works out to <strong>$137</strong> psf. </span><span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s right in line with what Sweeten contactor Jeff estimates a basic basement—walls, drainage, and electrical—will cost for homes in the Boston area. The cost increases once you add a bathroom or a bar according to Jeff.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit costs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the City of Boston, which covers over 200 square miles around the city center, <a href="https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/isd%20fee%20schedule_tcm3-31721.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">permits</span></a> for a major residential remodel starts at <strong>$50</strong>. This increases by <strong>$10</strong> for every <strong>$1,000</strong> of the budget. There are additional charges for electrical and plumbing work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your home is in Norfolk County then you will need to check the township your home is located in. The county is made of dozens of small towns and each has its own building permit system. For example, <a href="https://www.dedham-ma.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">in Dedham</span></a>, a permit for additions, including decks, costs <strong>$10</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> of planned work. This would mean a <strong>$30,000</strong> kitchen addition would attract a <strong>$300</strong> permit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over in <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/inspection/buildingelectricplumbingpermits/buildingfees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Cambridge</span></a>, which is located in Middlesex County, a building permit costs <strong>$15</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> in the budget. So a permit for that same <strong>$30,000</strong> kitchen addition would be <strong>$450</strong> in Cambridge.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639640020029"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a house in Boston?</u></strong> </strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A typical Boston home renovation costs roughly $100 per square foot. To maximize savings, complete the entire project at once, rather than splitting it up over several years. However, with Boston’s historically old housing stock, gut renovation costs may be higher than elsewhere with newer homes. Depending on the area, the choice in finishes, and the condition of the home or apartment, costs may reach $300 psf.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639640035271"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Boston?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">In Boston, budget-level kitchen remodels cost $15,000—$30,000 on average. Mid-grade Boston kitchens can range in cost from $30,000—$80,000, or roughly $400 per square foot. Higher costs usually coincide with larger square footage, but the final costs will also depend on the finishes and level of work needed. A high-end Boston kitchen remodel will usually start at $75,000 and go up dramatically; for luxury remodels, expect prices near $832 per square foot.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639640050956"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Boston?</u></strong></strong>

<p>The Hamptons…the mere mention conjures up images of poolside luxury and endless summer. But what’s it really like to live—and renovate—there? If you’re considering buying a home in the East End to renovate, there are some things you should know. Luckily for you, we’ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories—cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling’s</em> 2023 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)</strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf</strong></li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+</strong></li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000—$100,000</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000—$100,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Southampton</a> and the <a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of East Hampton</a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.</p>
<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class="s1">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="40" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester County</a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot</strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf</strong>.</p>
<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf</strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf</strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000</strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)</p>
<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. “Building materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">Costs for a kitchen renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget kitchen: Most budget-friendly Sweeten kitchen remodels&nbsp;average <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with basic finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Most Sweeten mid-grade can fall between <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong>. In Sweeten contractor John&#8217;s experience, he cites a mid-grade kitchen could average in the <strong>$75,000</strong> range.&nbsp;<a href="https://arielokin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Okin</a>, an interior designer who works in the Hamptons, tells us: “Kitchen gut renovations can range from <strong>$40,000—$150,000</strong> depending on the level of work the client wants, and the same goes for baths. Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.”</li>
<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000</strong> for high-end finishes. According to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2">, a major high-end kitchen remodel averages $178,347 in New York.&nbsp;</span><br>This is based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with top-of-the-line custom cabinets, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, microwave, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, as well as all new lighting and wood floors.</li>

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget bathroom remodel: At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. John quotes a three-piece (shower, sink, and toilet) project to average out to about <strong>$35,000&nbsp;</strong>for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Sweeten has completed bathroom renovations between <strong>$25,000—$40,000</strong> in the mid-range that covers about 100 square feet. </span></span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2"> cites an average of <strong>$29,915</strong> for a mid-grade bath remodel.</span></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: At the high-end range, Sweeten renovations that consist of three-pieces can cost between <strong>$40,000—$60,000</strong>. A high-end master suite remodel consisting of 4-5 pieces including a shower, double sink, bathtub, and toilet costs between <strong>$60,000—$100,000</strong>. According to Remodeling’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</span></a>, a high-end bathroom remodel averages <strong>$88,223</strong> in New York.

</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000</strong> on average.</p>
<h3>Costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/">basement remodels</a> budgeted at <strong>$100—$150 psf</strong> or <strong>$25,000</strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000—$100,000</strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons</h3>
<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects</a> elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental consultants</strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/">delicate ecosystems</a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350/hour</strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. </strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.</li>
<li><strong>Local attorneys</strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys’ fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements</h3>
<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don’t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won’t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.</span></p>
<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2224/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a change in the energy conservation requirements</a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000—$2,000</strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45239" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every homeowner wants their home remodeling project to be finished by a specified date and on (or under) budget. For example, a basement remodel that is contractually expected to be finished by Christmas for visiting relatives, must be done by the specified date. Yet, it is not uncommon for homeowners to wonder why the project isn’t following the schedule or if the job will finish on time. <strong>How can homeowners (or contractors) keep a project on schedule, while also saving money during remodeling? </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten </a></span><span class="s1">highlights one part of the process that both parties have relative control over to help keep the project on schedule. The<strong> logistics of ordering materials,</strong> including <strong>selection</strong>, <strong>payment</strong>, and <strong>delivery</strong>, is one area that both homeowners and contractors agree upon as being vital to that common goal. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mythbuster: Contractors want a project to go on and on</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing that might surprise homeowners starting a project is that the contractor is equally or even <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/qa-with-jean-general-contractor-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more anxious to keep the project on track</a>. This is because a smoothly running project means that the contractor can keep the client happy and within budget. Plus, this allows the contractor to successfully manage concurrent projects or move onto the next project on time.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Who does the ordering: contractor or homeowner?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before anything else happens, draw up a contract which both the homeowner and the contractor can sign. With this contract in place, a creative union with a common mission can begin: completing the project outlined in the contract. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The logistics of ordering materials and their delivery is one factor that the homeowner can easily control in either direction to suit their style better.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">When should the contractor order materials?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Generally, the contractor handles most of the supply chain of materials in a home improvement project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, the contractor will order the materials specified for the project. Materials are typically paid out of an initial deposit made by the homeowner and by scheduled progress payments or draws. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor rarely orders all materials at the same time. In fact, it makes more sense to stagger orders according to when they will be installed in the home. This also benefits the homeowner, because materials are paid for on a rolling basis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor or a representative takes delivery of the items and holds them either at an off-site storage location or on the building site. When it&#8217;s time to install the item, the contractor’s crew will shift the item to the building site.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the contractor is not the only person responsible for managing the selection of building materials. Except for raw building materials like drywall and two-by-four studs, other materials are the homeowner’s choice. The contractor and the homeowner will sit down together and select materials that match the homeowner’s taste and budget and satisfy the project specifications.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">When should the homeowner order materials? </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Occasionally, the homeowner and contractor arrange for the homeowner to order materials. Once the homeowner consults with the contractor, the homeowner then controls all aspects of this supply chain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowner chooses the materials, pays for them directly, accepts delivery, inspects the items, and stores them. If any items are damaged or incorrect, it is the responsibility of the homeowner to arrange for replacement or refund.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The secret: handling logistics and specs issues</span></h3>
<p>Contractors understand why homeowners want to be on top of the managing of their own materials—it&#8217;s their dream space. H<span class="s1">owever, a mix weighted on the side of the contractor handling most logistics often works best. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Reasons why homeowners may want contractors to handle the logistics:  </span></h4>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Homeowners often focus on showpiece items such as <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frameless shower enclosures</a>, natural imported stone, and one-of-a-kind sinks or cabinets. These pieces often require special parts or unique installation packages.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Homeowners who order their own items often lose sight of the bigger picture. By focusing on particular items, they may lose sight of how the components fit within the project as a whole. Spacing is crucial, with components fitting within code-required spatial areas.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Delivery acceptance can be a hang-up for many homeowners, both due to size and quantity of materials. Large slabs of granite, countertops, assembled cabinets, doors, and bathtubs are often delivered curbside. Plans must then be made to immediately move these items to a secure location. Large-quantity items, such as the numerous boxes of flooring that arrive on pallets, are equally important. These, too, must be moved to a dry, secure area.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Delivery timing can be difficult for busy homeowners to manage. While small items might arrive on a no-signature basis, most home-related items require that a person accept delivery and sign for it. For instance, when taking delivery of countertop materials or windows, you don’t want your neighbor signing off on it. A qualified person must inspect and sign for these items. With tailgate delivery items, you typically have the opportunity to view the item before it is off-loaded. This is also not something you want your neighbor to do!<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">As a homeowner who happens to be available to take delivery of materials, should you be doing this? Most homeowners do not know how to properly check for order amounts, damage, and missing pieces. Many fixtures come with very specific pieces and parts. For some items, if a tiny screw is missing from a particular piece, installation can be help up for days or weeks while the exact piece is reported, matched, and shipped.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Pros of letting professionals handle the logistics:</span></h4>

</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How to save time and money while remodeling </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to many contractors and veteran homeowner-remodelers, the easiest way to save time and money while remodeling is to master the logistics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To do this, you must ensure that you purchase the correct items on time, in the right order. Materials purchased too early may sit in storage for too long, or might be unreturnable later on if they cannot be used. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even worse, materials bought too late slow down the project or bring it to a complete stop. When the project stops, the subcontractors go off to other projects. The contractor may direct his or her attention to other clients. Completed work, particularly exterior work, may become damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How the homeowner can be involved:</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is your home, your renovation project. You want to help manage the project, especially in the area of materials ordering and logistics (and certainly if it&#8217;ll help you to save money while remodeling!) What’s the best way to do this?  </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Communicate with each other</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Establish a healthy flow of communication and information between you and your contractor. Phone, e-mail, video chat, and text each other on a regular basis over logistics matters; this is a best practice to follow which sets the tone for the renovation as it progresses.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Establish clear responsibilities</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Establish an agreement between the two of you as to who is responsible for which part of the logistics. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Aim for completion</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conclude with a complete list of responsibilities. Be sure to spell out every aspect in writing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These options are open for you and your contractor to discuss. Take stock of how much you want to personally be involved in the logistics and what feels right to reach your dream space.</span></p>
