<p>There are so many things to consider when planning a renovation. You need to think about scope and budget, materials and finishes, and so much more. Making over even a small space in your home is a big deal! Whether you&#8217;re transforming a bathroom or a whole house, there are scores of items to keep track of and decisions to make. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners share what they learned after going through the renovation process, and give their top home renovation tips.</p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Little renovation changes can make a big impact</h3>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updating your space doesn&#8217;t have to mean major construction. You can easily make a difference through small changes. Take, for example, AC; who turned to a Sweeten contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-duplex-loft-elevates-to-a-charming-rental/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help renovate his loft</a>. He did have some extensive work done, like electrical updates, adding office space, and enclosing a loft.  But he also made smaller changes. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nstead of replacing the kitchen cabinets, AC had them refinished in a rich, more modern blue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also brought his stair railing up-to-date with a new coat of paint. To modernize the bathroom, he changed the color of the walls from white to gray.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AC’s advice to those thinking of renovation? “Just to be realistic,” he says. “With little changes, you can make a big impact.”</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Work with design professionals, if you can</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiring an interior designer</a> is a nice perk if you can fit it in your budget. They provide a keen eye for design and convenience that many renovators find extremely helpful. &#8220;I highly recommend working with a design professional,&#8221; says Matthew Stewart, who recently worked with a Sweeten contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovate his own condo in Brooklyn</a>. &#8220;It’s easy to underestimate the amount of work involved.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also recommends not getting too hung up on specific choices. &#8220;Sometimes it’s easier to just pick something nice that you know you like, and move on,&#8221; he says. And interior designers make that easy, narrowing it down to just a few options that fit your style and project. </span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: Budget Wisely: Nice-to-Haves vs. Must-Haves</h3>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting—and sticking to—your budget is important. Sometimes it is easier said than done. &#8220;When you’re renovating, plan that it will take more time and money than you plan for,&#8221; says Sweeten renovator Claire. &#8220;There are always surprise things that happen as you go through the process.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">converted her studio</a> into a junior one-bedroom, she &#8220;ended up spending roughly 25% more than the original budget.&#8221; That was due to added change orders to address issues that came up. Her advice is to decide your renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“must-haves” and “nice-to-haves”</a> and stick with them.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Know what you need in a contractor—and for your renovation</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner/contractor partnership is like any relationship—you need to communicate for it to work. And part of that is knowing what you want, what you expect from the other person, and vice versa. For<a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/odd-shaped-kitchen-co-op-refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ryan and Sophie</a>, finding the right contractor was vital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had spent ten years saving up to renovate their one-bedroom, so they wanted it done right.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when,&#8221; says Ryan. &#8220;Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership.&#8221; He also suggests having &#8220;a plan so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Successful handling of orders &amp; delivery is a simple way to save money while remodeling and keep the project on track</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45239" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every homeowner wants their home remodeling project to be finished by a specified date and on (or under) budget. For example, a basement remodel that is contractually expected to be finished by Christmas for visiting relatives, must be done by the specified date. Yet, it is not uncommon for homeowners to wonder why the project isn’t following the schedule or if the job will finish on time. <strong>How can homeowners (or contractors) keep a project on schedule, while also saving money during remodeling? </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten </a></span><span class="s1">highlights one part of the process that both parties have relative control over to help keep the project on schedule. The<strong> logistics of ordering materials,</strong> including <strong>selection</strong>, <strong>payment</strong>, and <strong>delivery</strong>, is one area that both homeowners and contractors agree upon as being vital to that common goal. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mythbuster: Contractors want a project to go on and on</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing that might surprise homeowners starting a project is that the contractor is equally or even <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/qa-with-jean-general-contractor-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more anxious to keep the project on track</a>. This is because a smoothly running project means that the contractor can keep the client happy and within budget. Plus, this allows the contractor to successfully manage concurrent projects or move onto the next project on time.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Who does the ordering: contractor or homeowner?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before anything else happens, draw up a contract which both the homeowner and the contractor can sign. With this contract in place, a creative union with a common mission can begin: completing the project outlined in the contract. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The logistics of ordering materials and their delivery is one factor that the homeowner can easily control in either direction to suit their style better.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">When should the contractor order materials?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Generally, the contractor handles most of the supply chain of materials in a home improvement project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, the contractor will order the materials specified for the project. Materials are typically paid out of an initial deposit made by the homeowner and by scheduled progress payments or draws. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor rarely orders all materials at the same time. In fact, it makes more sense to stagger orders according to when they will be installed in the home. This also benefits the homeowner, because materials are paid for on a rolling basis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor or a representative takes delivery of the items and holds them either at an off-site storage location or on the building site. When it&#8217;s time to install the item, the contractor’s crew will shift the item to the building site.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the contractor is not the only person responsible for managing the selection of building materials. Except for raw building materials like drywall and two-by-four studs, other materials are the homeowner’s choice. The contractor and the homeowner will sit down together and select materials that match the homeowner’s taste and budget and satisfy the project specifications.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">When should the homeowner order materials? </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Occasionally, the homeowner and contractor arrange for the homeowner to order materials. Once the homeowner consults with the contractor, the homeowner then controls all aspects of this supply chain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowner chooses the materials, pays for them directly, accepts delivery, inspects the items, and stores them. If any items are damaged or incorrect, it is the responsibility of the homeowner to arrange for replacement or refund.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The secret: handling logistics and specs issues</span></h3>
<p>Contractors understand why homeowners want to be on top of the managing of their own materials—it&#8217;s their dream space. H<span class="s1">owever, a mix weighted on the side of the contractor handling most logistics often works best. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Reasons why homeowners may want contractors to handle the logistics:  </span></h4>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Homeowners often focus on showpiece items such as <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frameless shower enclosures</a>, natural imported stone, and one-of-a-kind sinks or cabinets. These pieces often require special parts or unique installation packages.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Homeowners who order their own items often lose sight of the bigger picture. By focusing on particular items, they may lose sight of how the components fit within the project as a whole. Spacing is crucial, with components fitting within code-required spatial areas.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Delivery acceptance can be a hang-up for many homeowners, both due to size and quantity of materials. Large slabs of granite, countertops, assembled cabinets, doors, and bathtubs are often delivered curbside. Plans must then be made to immediately move these items to a secure location. Large-quantity items, such as the numerous boxes of flooring that arrive on pallets, are equally important. These, too, must be moved to a dry, secure area.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Delivery timing can be difficult for busy homeowners to manage. While small items might arrive on a no-signature basis, most home-related items require that a person accept delivery and sign for it. For instance, when taking delivery of countertop materials or windows, you don’t want your neighbor signing off on it. A qualified person must inspect and sign for these items. With tailgate delivery items, you typically have the opportunity to view the item before it is off-loaded. This is also not something you want your neighbor to do!<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">As a homeowner who happens to be available to take delivery of materials, should you be doing this? Most homeowners do not know how to properly check for order amounts, damage, and missing pieces. Many fixtures come with very specific pieces and parts. For some items, if a tiny screw is missing from a particular piece, installation can be help up for days or weeks while the exact piece is reported, matched, and shipped.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Pros of letting professionals handle the logistics:</span></h4>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pros:</b></span></h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Orders delivered on time<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Correct lead line<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Specifications controlled by the contractor<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">All parts correctly ordered<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Delivery acceptance and storage<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Contractor expertise with materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Trade discounts possible<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How to save time and money while remodeling </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to many contractors and veteran homeowner-remodelers, the easiest way to save time and money while remodeling is to master the logistics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To do this, you must ensure that you purchase the correct items on time, in the right order. Materials purchased too early may sit in storage for too long, or might be unreturnable later on if they cannot be used. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even worse, materials bought too late slow down the project or bring it to a complete stop. When the project stops, the subcontractors go off to other projects. The contractor may direct his or her attention to other clients. Completed work, particularly exterior work, may become damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How the homeowner can be involved:</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is your home, your renovation project. You want to help manage the project, especially in the area of materials ordering and logistics (and certainly if it&#8217;ll help you to save money while remodeling!) What’s the best way to do this?  </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Communicate with each other</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Establish a healthy flow of communication and information between you and your contractor. Phone, e-mail, video chat, and text each other on a regular basis over logistics matters; this is a best practice to follow which sets the tone for the renovation as it progresses.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Establish clear responsibilities</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Establish an agreement between the two of you as to who is responsible for which part of the logistics. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Aim for completion</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conclude with a complete list of responsibilities. Be sure to spell out every aspect in writing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These options are open for you and your contractor to discuss. Take stock of how much you want to personally be involved in the logistics and what feels right to reach your dream space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">—</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15503 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15501 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15502" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although navigating the renovation process combined with caring for a new baby was stressful, the family is thrilled with the results. “Little things popped up, but we dealt with them. There was nothing too crazy or too expensive, and that’s because of our contractor. We had a good working relationship,&#8221; Karen said.</p>
