<h3>Elevating the best aspects of home</h3>
<p class="p8">We have been living in this apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, since 2015. It was the first place we lived together, and it felt like a real 1980s loft, which Sue and I liked a lot. The previous owner was crafty—he’d installed his own kitchen cabinets, and the spirit of the place was very DIY. Sue works in Fin-tech and I am in interior design. We didn’t do much work when we first moved in, thinking it made sense to let the apartment evolve.</p>

<p>The apartment comprises approximately 900 square feet. It had many vantage points, which our cat, who recently passed, really enjoyed. The neighborhood seems to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of industrial building conversions</a>—a church here, a school there, made into residential apartments. Our building belongs to the latter group, and was converted more than 30 years ago. Visitors are often amazed at how wide the hallways are. That sort of space is not something you often encounter in NYC.</p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Honing in on the shared lifestyle</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Looking to build on the apartment’s openness, we made a few changes early on. One was removing a spiral staircase and replacing it with an industrial-use stair; it remains in the same location in the current iteration. Another was taking out an idiosyncratic shelving system that the previous owner had installed. We are both utilitarian, and that aspect of our personalities influences our aesthetic.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-staircase-leading-to-loft" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg" alt="View of the black staircase leading to loft along with dining area and kitchen after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50882" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="dining-area-with-open-shelving" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg" alt="Dining area with open shelving unit overlooking the black staircase leading to the loft after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50881" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We also like this word that the Dutch have, <i>Gezellig,</i> which translates to something like coziness. It’s not a style, per se, but achieving it was a driving force for our renovation. We didn’t want an overly designed space, but rather one that felt <i>considered.</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Practical launch pad to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated our renovation</a> to coincide with the water boiler warranty expiration. Each unit has its own boiler, and you always hear about these things failing shortly after their warranty goes. We figured we would try to avoid becoming a statistic. Another <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivation to upgrade</a> was the desperate need for an electrical panel overhaul in the apartment. </span><span class="s1">We wanted to add an in-unit washer and dryer and a shower to our powder room. In addition, the apartment lacked, and desperately needed, built-in storage. </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We posted our project, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> was a great help in providing a list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant contractors in Brooklyn</a>. Since I work in this field, I did not utilize other services the company provides. I wanted to complete the renovation within an allotted time frame, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep within a firm budget</a>. Our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor proposed great ideas</a>. We had a few conversations before the renovation, and she was very accommodating. </span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Design tricks-of-the-trade</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It is always exciting to see a project on paper come to life, but it is especially interesting when you have an experimental client—in this case, ha!, ourselves. Our contractor convinced me that we should open up the entry foyer, which I wasn’t sure of. But in the end I think sacrificing the extra storage was worth it to expand the passageway. We also separated the passthrough between the dining and living space with an oversized barn door, which disappears when retracted.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We employed other tricks as well. Take the painting and color scheme, for example. We applied a World War I ship-camouflage technique known as Dazzle—which was a way of masking the volume and shape of military ships using geometric patterns—to try to make walls and objects more or less vanish into the space. We used black behind the TV to have it blend into the space. It is also a nod to the blackboard that would have hung on the wall in this former classroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stayed with a pretty strict material palette just because it is easier to manage and is also a fun challenge to stretch the limit of the material. For example, the black countertop and black backsplash is actually a paper-based product that is extremely durable. I also used it as treads for the stairs.</span></p>

<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Being flexible during the process</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No matter how simple you aim to keep it, in any construction project, there will be challenges to overcome. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved out of the apartment</a> during the renovation, but I went to the job site every other day to make sure we were moving forward. During one visit, I noticed that the contracting team had framed one of the walls in the wrong location. Instead of losing time having the contractor demolish the framing and restart, however, I decided to redesign that portion of the space. I did it overnight. In the end, we were able to salvage the work and it turned out nicely. It felt serendipitous. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A Manhattan loft remodel showcases sliding doors, an entire kitchen, and elegant style</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><em><span class="s1">This is what Europeans-turned-New-Yorkers, Uldis and Serge, saw when they stepped into a loft in a 1929 industrial building in Manhattan’s Midtown East: soaring 12- to14-foot ceilings, floating steps to a steel and tempered glass mezzanine, and 10-foot windows overlooking a tree-lined courtyard. They were sold on the historic feel and open concept but a remodel was in order including a full kitchen installation, new lighting, and reworking the layout to fit a master bedroom.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My partner, Uldis, and I are both from Europe. We have been dreaming of New York for quite a while before we were able to move to this very special city. </span><span class="s1">Initially, we stayed in a rental apartment. At some point, we decided to buy our own place. </span><span class="s1">When we viewed our new home, we liked it right away and made up our minds fairly fast! </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42360 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="portrait renovating homeowners" width="1000" height="1471" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev-204x300.jpg 204w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/portrait-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x883.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our new 800-square-foot former studio is located in a historic property in Midtown East. Originally built in 1929 as a design school, the 27-story tower was briefly home to a print factory. In 1979, its careful conversion to an apartment building was noted with the First Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects. As a condop, the building combines all the magnetism of a graceful prewar property with the flexibility of a condo.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42351 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/entrance-door-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="studio loft foyer, staircase" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/entrance-door-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/entrance-door-Sergei-Gorbylev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/entrance-door-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/entrance-door-Sergei-Gorbylev-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We liked the overall structure of the apartment. However, we wanted to slightly change the layout to create a master bedroom. The plan was to also rebuild the kitchen, repair and repaint the floor, walls, and ceilings, and upgrade the bathroom and lighting throughout the apartment. In addition, we sought to incorporate eye-catching details of American Mid-century modern style to soften the space and make the place feel homier.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My genuine interest, passion, and experience in design allowed us to renovate without an architect or interior designer. One of our biggest <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenges was to find a contractor</a>. This was our first renovation project and we didn’t know where to start. We were grateful to discover Sweeten which helped to connect us with our general contractor. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The biggest upgrade was in the former kitchenette. There was a sink, a few kitchen cabinets, and a few appliances all installed alongside one tiny wall. There were also several kitchen carts to allow for some extra storage. We saw the potential and decided to build a full kitchen.</span></p>
<p>We used an online design service to prepare a 3D design rendering, which included floor plans, elevations, and materials to buy. When our kitchen design was ready, we purchased our kitchen confidently, knowing everything would work.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">We wanted to keep this open airy feeling. Yet, we still wanted a separate master bedroom. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To use all of the space available, we opted for an L-shape layout that forms a &#8216;grotto&#8217; underneath the standing loft. </span><span class="s1">The gas range moved to the back wall as well as the microwave, which serves as an under cabinet range hood. At first, we wanted our kitchen to be all in white. However, in the end, we decided to mix contrasting colors and finishes with the upper cabinets in a high gloss white and stainless steel cabinets on the bottom to anchor loft-like details. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42378 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a.jpg" alt="bathroom, glass backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-14a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">We chose a black tempered glass backsplash for a luxurious feel along with a white ceramic sink and white quartz countertop for a sleek look. </span><span class="s1">The brushed brass and nickel accents—also seen in the rest of the home—were chosen to create a dramatic contrast.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42381 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04.jpg" alt="studio loft before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sergei-Gorbylev-Loft-Before-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It wasn’t practical to mount any ceiling lights under the mezzanine overhang. Instead, we used integrated kitchen lighting panels to completely cover the underside of the wall cabinets to spread more light all over the kitchen. Besides, a swing-arm brass wall sconce was installed to cast additional light. </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The second biggest upgrade was to divide the room into two parts. We liked the existing modern open floor plan and stunning living room bathed in natural light. We wanted to keep this open airy feeling. Yet, we still wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate master bedroom</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We chose sliding doors with translucent cloud acrylic inserts to separate the space. They let natural light through but also give privacy. Because of the structural simplicity and lightweight design, the whole construction was installed without a floor track which helped us achieve a clean look.</span><span class="s1"> Our Sweeten contractor built a soffit to hold the sliding doors and hide new electrical wiring. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In our spa-inspired bathroom, we painted the ceiling, replaced the grout and fixtures, and installed new bathroom hardware. Since storage space was limited, we installed a floating high cabinet with a mirrored door to store bathroom essentials. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We had planned to paint all the walls white but decided to paint some walls in gray while keeping opposite walls in white. That’s where we encountered 250 shades of gray! </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It took us several days to decide on the shade of gray which would elevate other elements of the design that were already existing in the space—an oversized mirror made from antique surveyor sticks, an old 1929 old clock face from an NYC building and 1920s klieg lights from a 1920s movie theater. </span><span class="s1">We love the way our warm brass fixtures, mirrors, and pieces of our décor highlight the gray’s blue undertones. </span></p>
<p class="p1">We also had to slightly update a 20-foot of closet space. Finished with seven-foot frosted tempered glass sliding doors, our oversized custom-designed closets needed some repairs.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The next step was to fix and refinish the African wenge hardwood floors. We used a True Black stain by Minwax to achieve a sleek modern look.</span><span class="s1"> Our floors are a perfect backdrop against light walls and neutral-toned furniture and accents. </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To accommodate multiple zones stacked on one another, we installed track lighting from the hallway to the bedroom to cast bright warm light, creating a sophisticated environment. Our contractor was very helpful in the lightning upgrade and recommended sources for most of the fixtures. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The renovation process took longer than we had originally hoped. This was due to the renovation approval process and the busy schedule of our contractor. </span><span class="s2">Yet, w</span><span class="s1">e remember this as a positive experience which made us appreciate what we have now!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple chooses a specific layout to design their dream custom kitchen</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Giving new life to an estate-condition kitchen and living room in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier had already lived in New York City as renters for several years when they made the decision to make the Big Apple their long-term home. This meant a move from the Upper West Side to Brooklyn, which they preferred for its pace and culture. Rentals were considered but ultimately rejected because of their notoriously small kitchens; the couple loves to cook and needed enough space to work together comfortably. An updated unit in the Clinton Hill Co-ops caught their eye—but unfortunately, they were outbid. Then, having fallen in love with the CHCs (as have many other Sweeten renovators before them!), they realized they could buy one of the units that needed work and have the money to spend on a custom renovation. They made their choice based on the layouts that had space for their ideal custom kitchen. In the unit they selected, everything had to go—the dingy wallpaper and paint, bad tile, and a kitchen that hadn’t been touched in decades. The only thing that would remain were the floors, which would be sanded and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a>. They decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> for the job after posting their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier achieved the “modern industrial, open-concept feel” they were looking for by demolishing the walls between the old pantry, living room, dining room, and kitchen. “We wanted a lighter feeling in the apartment, given that the ceiling is not particularly high,” Natalie explained. With less obstruction, the custom kitchen was brightened by the windows in the dining nook and spacious enough for the pair to host dinner parties. They also added plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> for storing all of their kitchen equipment. The sink and dishwasher moved to the wall perpendicular to the stove, allowing their Sweeten contractor to increase counter space and improve the custom kitchen’s overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flow</a>. The addition of a built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spice drawer</a> and cabinets with pull-out drawers meant that there was a designated spot for their kitchen goods—from small appliances to pots and pans. With many moving parts, Natalie and Cartier relied on Christina, their Sweeten Planner, to help stay on top of their renovation in real time throughout their home&#8217;s transformation. They even received a comprehensive digital record documenting their three-month renovation at completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Cartier was keen on having a “smart” home, so the living room air conditioning and many lights are connected via Wi-Fi and controlled by the Echo.</p>
