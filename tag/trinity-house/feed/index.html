<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, we’re taking a look at the rebirth of a trinity townhouse in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. The house, built in the style of a trinity, a slim structure that became popular during a population boom in the early 18th century, caught Nel&#8217;s eye while she was looking to purchase her first home. Two years later, the house was severely damaged by a fire that ravaged the entire street, resulting in a total gut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,200-square-foot home has three stories—plus a basement and roof deck with amazing city views—and had to be rebuilt from the studs up. Nel decided to keep the original floor plans intact—the first-floor dining room and kitchen, second-floor living room plus full bath, and third-floor master bedroom and bath—and bring them back to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her renovation plans in mind</a>, she came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, to restore the house to its former glory and find a new tenant who would love it just as much as she did.</p>

</a><b><br />
Sweeten: </b>What motivated you to purchase this trinity house and what led to the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>In 2014 I was looking to purchase my first home, and when I saw this house I absolutely fell in love with it. The house is a 100-year-old trinity located in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. I&#8217;m not sure if you have seen many trinities, but they are a pretty common home type in Philadelphia where the house is three stories tall and each floor is typically a single room. I met Greg shortly thereafter and the two of us lived in the house up until we got engaged in April 2016. We decided to move out because we were thinking about starting a family and wanted to find a home with a second bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was a bit attached to this house and since I work in real estate we decided to try our hand at renting it versus selling it. We found great tenants and everything was going well until the fire last October. The fire destroyed six houses—so basically, the entire block! It was heart-wrenching to watch something I had so many happy memories in be destroyed by fire. But, very fortunately, we have been able to rebuild, which actually has been a funny process because we were able to make some of the upgrades and changes we previously wanted to do when we lived there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What made you choose the neighborhood back when you were looking to purchase a home?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>The Bella Vista neighborhood is truly one of my favorites in Philadelphia. We have a 100-year-old Italian bakery at the end of our street and so there is always the wonderful smell of something delicious baking in the air. We are also just around the corner from a park with a bocce court, as well as from the 9th Street Italian Market. I love the neighborhood&#8217;s vibe and all of the small independent businesses and restaurants that are at our front door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What’s your favorite part of the house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>I think one of my favorite parts, aside from the 360-degree views from the roof deck, is the exposed brick wall. It feels like a piece of history which is really neat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What it was like working with your general contractor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>This is actually our second renovation in 12 months, but our first time using Sweeten. I can&#8217;t tell you how wonderful our Sweeten contractor has been. He took a very stressful situation and guided us through it with ease, and we couldn&#8217;t have been happier with how everything has turned out. Greg and I have actually joked about moving back in!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>Now that the house is finished, what are your plans for it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>We are going to keep it as a rental for now and who knows&#8230;maybe someday we will live there again!</p>

<p><strong>Now let’s check in with the Sweeten general contractor responsible for this townhouse’s transformation.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What were the challenges you faced while renovating this trinity house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor:</b> It was the amount of work that needed to take place in the small footprint of the house. We needed to add new code-compliant systems to a home that was designed to have a small footprint over 100 years ago! Several homes on the same block that were also damaged in the fire were under construction at the same time, so parking was limited. Material deliveries on the small street were very tough, if not impossible. All of the materials for the roof deck and drywall needed to be loaded in by hand. Also, work on the roof deck was held up due to permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What was the damage done by the fire?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>The entire home was flooded by the water used to extinguish the rooftop fire. The house was dried out and all damaged organic materials were removed prior to us being hired by a restoration company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What major work did you and your team tackle during the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>We installed all new electric, some plumbing, a new high-efficiency HVAC, insulation, drywall, and new finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> Did you encounter any delays during the process?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Yes, the roof deck had to be designed by a licensed architect—we couldn&#8217;t replace what was there under the permit for the interior. The drawings for the roof deck also needed to be completed and reviewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> The results are simply stunning—all of your hard work has definitely paid off!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Overall, it was a great project, Nel was a wonderful client and we couldn&#8217;t have done it without Sweeten making the match. We are very proud of the work we did here and how the home turned out.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Nel and her Sweeten general contractor for sharing their story, both the good and the bad, and giving us a look inside this reborn trinity!</em></p>
