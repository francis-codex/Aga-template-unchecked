										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Creating efficiently beautiful spaces is what we do and we believe this apartment is as efficient as it gets. We design spaces that function with little room for excess fluff&#8230;everything has a purpose.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Anishka Clarke tS member &amp; co-owner of Ishka Designs</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/park-slope-apartment-interior-makeover/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10092" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.png" alt="00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The owner of this bright, 750sqft 1-bed in Park Slope works for one of the top 3 consulting firms in the US which means she works long hours and weekends, and travels a ridiculous amount for work &#8212; then, when she gets a break, she&#8217;s back out the door, traveling for leisure. Though she spends so much of her time away from home, she still finds time to &#8220;live&#8221; in each room and entertain regularly. When she first purchased her apartment a couple years ago, however, its vibe wasn&#8217;t right for her lifestyle, and she contacted tS member <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402">Ishka Designs</a>, co-owned by Anishka Clarke &amp; Niya Bascom, to help make it her own. The Ishka team transformed the dark, cramped apartment into a relaxing oasis where this homeowner can unwind after her usual busy day or weeklong work trip, and likewise, its sophisticated, urban character makes it a perfect place to entertain high-level clients &amp; colleagues.<span id="more-10004"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10130" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg" alt="01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt Before" width="600" height="225" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation — the apartment was painted in various colors from room to room which made the spaces feel disjointed, and in general, many of the existing finishes weren&#8217;t aligned with the homeowner&#8217;s tastes. The furniture around the home was also clunky and needed updating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10009" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="Union St Apt" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovated bedroom is bright and tranquil. Anishka &amp; Niya chose to use a soft white paint, <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/find-your-color/color/962/gray-mist?color=962">BM Grey Mist</a>, throughout the apartment&#8217;s walls to amplify natural daylight and continuity between spaces. The bed was designed custom by Ishka Designs; we love how they&#8217;ve created the illusion that it&#8217;s actually floating in the space, without any legs or structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="405" /></a></p>
<p>Rather than using more traditional nightstands, the designers chose <a href="https://www.cb2.com/peekaboo-clear-nesting-tables-set-of-three/f117">acrylic nesting tables from CB2</a> which add to the weightlessness of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10069" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the new bathroom design, they created a relaxing, Zen-like spa atmosphere, using subtle textures, a neutral color  palette, and clean lines.  The vanity is a custom unit made of walnut with marine-grade sealant; it was built by our friends at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors who were the contractors for the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10012" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design team also created a custom media unit for the living room. The unit was designed not only to fit the space and character of the new home, but to perform specific functions for the client and keep the decor uncluttered. They also incorporated the room&#8217;s non-functional chimney as an extension of the media unit. It took a little convincing to get the homeowner onboard with painting the exposed brick, but it was definitely worthwhile, as the result really helps brighten the space and fits much better with the decor&#8217;s clean and pure aesthetic. The designers purchased the <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/product/detail.do?productGroup=19620&amp;catalog=filter&amp;menuCatalog=room&amp;menuCategory=201&amp;menuSubcategory=143">Portica coffee table</a> and <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/product/detail.do?productGroup=19434&amp;catalog=filter&amp;menuCatalog=room&amp;menuCategory=201&amp;menuSubcategory=198">Loring sofa</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10015" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="Union St Apt" width="600" height="693" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-260x300.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anishka &amp; Niya sourced all of the artwork in the space from local, Brooklyn artists. The painting featured here in the dining space is by artist Jamal Ince; the vibrant piece makes a great compliment to the dining chairs by <a href="https://www.robertallendesign.com/">Robert Allen</a>. The dining table is by  <a href="https://www.mgbwhome.com/">Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10071" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="444" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flowers and houseplants are the perfect accessories for the nature-inspired interior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10072" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This thoughtful interior puts us right at ease, it&#8217;s truly sublime. Awesome work and many thanks to Ishka Designs!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Special thanks also to Niya Bascom, Photographer &amp; Executive Director of Ishka Designs, for sharing these beautiful photos.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Nick worked directly with me in a brief design phase to make sure what we proposed would actually work. His ability to design AND build was key.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Glenn M., Zeebox Team Member</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the things we love most about doing commercial projects is that we get to know new local businesses &#8212; like Sotto 13 and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/site-visit-w-forever-construction-design-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fanbridge</a> &#8212; through their workplace renovations. This week we got to connect with another new company and check out the results of their recent <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Office/Small-Front-Office-Renovation-New-York-NY-awarded-to-contractor/816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office renovation project</a>. Glenn Masterson (pictured above) lead the team at Zeebox, a London-based company with a free app for TV-lovers, to theSweeten to find the right contractor for a project at their new SoHo office. Zeebox was happy to be connected with tS member firm <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a> who helped them build the more productive space they had in mind.<span id="more-8106"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_8108" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8108" class="size-full wp-image-8108" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice-before-01.jpeg" alt="caption" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice-before-01.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice-before-01-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8108" class="wp-caption-text">Before: The office opened to a 10&#8242; x 13&#8242; reception area with a large closet along one wall. The space was functional, but &#8212; with a greater need for desk space than storage &#8212; not the most efficient solution for the Zeebox team.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_8113" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8113" class="size-full wp-image-8113" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/06_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice.jpeg" alt="caption" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/06_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/06_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8113" class="wp-caption-text">Zeebox&#8217;s plan was to tear out the closet, reclaiming its depth, and to wrap a built-in desktop around the 3-wall perimeter of the space &#8212; this would add approximately 40 linear ft of desk space. They would also need to update the lighting and add electrical outlets for a fully-functional workspace.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_8110" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8110" class="size-full wp-image-8110" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice.jpg" alt="caption" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_theSweeten_NKCI_ZeeboxOffice-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8110" class="wp-caption-text">After building this beautiful, custom floating desk last fall, we knew Nick Dillon of NKCI would be perfect for Zeebox&#8217;s project. Nick and his team worked closely with Glenn to achieve exactly what the company was looking for. We especially like how the space of the former closet has been turned into a soffited alcove with recessed lighting.</p></div>

The desktop also features grommeted openings for the electrical cords and is painted in Benjamin Moore hue <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/whitesatin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white satin</a> with a cabinet coat finish.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re in the home of interior designer Katherine Hammond to check out the newest addition to her lovely Brooklyn Brownstone. After hearing about us from a friend, Katherine posted on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> seeking a contractor to build the <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom floating desk</a> she had designed. We matched her up with Nick Dillon of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a>, who worked with the designer to build and install her floating-concept desk. When the project was completed, Katherine reported that Nick was a &#8216;dream to work with&#8217; &#8211;and, as a bonus to us, she even ended up becoming a member of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> network with her company <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Hammond Interiors</a>!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6011 size-full mb-24" title="01_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> </a>Here&#8217;s a shot of the space when <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine posted her project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6009"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6012 mb-24 size-full" title="02_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s the transformed space! Katherine&#8217;s desk spans the length of the wall and is built-in for a floating effect, rather than being held up by vertical structural elements. Katherine explained that Nick advised her in the desk&#8217;s structural design, adding 3 thin steel brackets at different intervals across the span of the desk. In the center-back, the desk features a linear opening for cords so that items can be plugged in neatly and also moved from side to side. Beneath the opening, the cords are run through a hollow channel and straight to a power source which was relocated by NKCI for this purpose. These details allow Katherine can keep her desk as cord-free as possible!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6031 mb-24 size-full" title="03_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s Nick Dillon, owner of Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, on site during the desk installation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6014 size-full" title="04_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desk was designed to be tucked away in the alcove behind this headboard. Like much of this Brooklyn Brownstone interior, the headboard, which doubles as a bookcase on the other side, was designed and built by Katherine and her father. Katherine consulted Francois Chambard of <a href="https://umproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UM Project</a>, an innovative furniture design co., for construction detailing to ensure a minimal look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6015 mb-24 size-full" title="05_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> When Nick &amp; his crew came to install the desk (which they built off-site), Nick did his usual, <a href="/2012/06/21/site-visit-w-nick-knacks-creative-interiors-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very meticulous prep-work</a> in order to ensure that none of Katherine&#8217;s belongings were damaged.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6016 mb-24 size-full" title="06_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> We love how clean and minimal the design is &#8211;and while we can only see a glimpse of the desk from around the corner, we can still get a sense of its conceptual lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6017 mb-24 size-full" title="07_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s the designer, Katherine Hammond. Once her desk was in place, Katherine painted a few layers of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic paint primer</a> onto the wall above. Now her inspirations can also float (without damaging the wall!). Covering the magnetic layer is Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-painting-contractors/paint-products/satin-impervo-alkyd-low-lustre-paint#advs=0&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satin Impervo</a>, which was also used on the desk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6029 mb-24 size-full" title="09_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desktop and drawer faces were built with MDF then painted, while the drawer interiors feature the natural grain and texture of finished plywood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6030 mb-24 size-full" title="10_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />We couldn&#8217;t be happier to have found the perfect match for Katherine&#8217;s project! Many thanks to Nick, Dawn &amp; team at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, and to Katherine of Katherine Hammond Interiors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we&#8217;re catching up with another one of our new GC&#8217;s &#8212;<a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a> is a husband-wife team lead by Nick &amp; Dawn Dillon. The homeowners (a pair of young, newly-wed professionals) chose Nick Knacks after interviewing 7 other contractors for this project which included renovating both a master (full) bath and a half bath in their Upper West Side home. Nick has a knack for details, so we&#8217;ve broken down the nitty-gritty on just the master bath makeover.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3502" title="nicknackbefore 2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>The Nick Knacks team did a complete gut of the bathroom space to discover rotted flooring along with old plumbing lines and pipes that would have to be re-routed in order to realize its new design. After re-routing the plumbing where necessary, they upgraded all of the wiring to code, also adding recessed ceiling lights, 2 vanity light fixtures, a silent vent fan, and designated dimmer switches&#8230; Then onto the details below! <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3503" title="nickknacks_01" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Nick always stresses the importance of proper site prep &#8212; for this project, his team spent an entire day protecting surfaces, setting up equipment &amp;  preliminary building materials to create a proper construction zone (which was also 99% dust free!). <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3504" title="nickknacks_02" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Here&#8217;s a first view into the renovated master bath. Nick&#8217;s design featured classic white beveled-edge subway tiles and <a href="https://store.benjaminmoore.com/storefront/shop-by-product/interior-paints/aura-interior-paint/prodPRM24.html?sbcColor=2033_70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Aura Sweet Honeydew Melon</a> on the walls, as well as framed inset medicine cabinets from <a href="https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?link=MedicineCabinets&amp;categoryId=cat1520041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a>, and a new granite top for the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3505" title="nickknacks_03" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>When it came to the bathroom cabinets, Nick worked closely with these homeowners to come up with a custom solution that was &#8220;exactly it.&#8221; Nick did the design, fabrication, installation and wood staining of the double sink base cabinet (above) as well as a floating sink base and vertical storage cabinets in the half bath. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3500" title="nickknacks_04" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Nick&#8217;s eye for details is also found in the finish of the window sill and tub ledge where he matched the granite used on the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3501" title="nickknacks_05" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>He also chose lighting and bath fixtures in polished chrome, including faucet and shower fittings from the <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Collections-Purist/category/430068/430062.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler Purist Collection</a>. The floors and tub side were tiled with these unglazed porcelain in <a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/72620612710977408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linosa by Basaltina</a>.</p>
<p>Nick says that the homeowners were so pleased with the bathrooms that they added a custom bedroom closet to the scope of the original project. Great work and many thanks to Nick &amp; Dawn!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we met up with Nick Dillon and his crew at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors. The guys are off to a good start on this residential lighting project in South Williamsburg, which they were awarded via <a href="http://sweeten.com">Sweeten</a>. For the homeowners, a thorough revamp of the lighting scheme in their 1400 sqft home all started with one dark closet. In addition to the closet, not a single one of their 3 bedrooms nor the living and dining spaces was equipped with overhead lighting. Nick worked closely with the homeowners to come up with the best lighting solutions for each space. In order to finish the job, they&#8217;ll also be replacing the existing, standard ceiling-mounted hallway fixtures with something a little more stylish.</p>

Here he is on day 1 prepping the guest bedroom with one of his crew members.<span id="more-3820"></span> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3823" title="03_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Here&#8217;s an example of a dark corner in the living space that really needed some overhead light. Nick helped the homeowners come up with a track light system that will fit the space perfectly. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3824" title="04_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>The team started work in the living and dining areas. In only a matter of a few hours they&#8217;d drawn electricity through to the new 3-way switches and fixture locations, and by the end of the first day the tracks were already installed. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3825" title="05_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Here&#8217;s where they added a switch location and have drawn power through. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3826" title="06_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>We loved the brushed steel tracks &amp; fixtures these homeowners chose for the living room. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3827" title="07_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Nick suggested 3-way switches for the spacious, open living / dining space, and they installed these Lutron Maestro digital dimmers (600 Watts). <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3828" title="08_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>On our second visit we could see more of Nick&#8217;s systematic style. Back in the dining space, the guys had installed &#8220;pigtail&#8221; lamps in place of the future fixture, which will be an industrial-style chandelier from Rejuvenation. Nick said these dangling pigtail lights represent where the new electrical connections had been made and properly secured. Next, the cuts to the ceiling (and walls) will need to be patched with drywall, then plastered and painted, before the final fixtures are installed. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3829" title="09_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>After the living / dining spaces, Nick and his crew moved into the guest bedroom and office, leaving more pigtails behind until the ceiling has been mended.</p>
<p>At this point, they&#8217;re almost halfway finished with this 7-day job. Next they&#8217;ll be working on a new entryway chandelier and the master bedroom. We can&#8217;t wait to see all the new fixtures installed!</p>
