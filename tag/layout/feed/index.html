			<h2>Six open concept kitchen ideas by Sweeten imbue space, flow, and natural light</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>When asked what they want in a kitchen remodel, many homeowners echo the same idea: an open-concept kitchen. Gone are the days of the kitchen being cordoned off. No more swinging doors or small entryways. Renovators want big, open spaces that connect the kitchen to the dining area and sometimes to the living room, too. It is a modern concept that is both inviting and multifunctional. It also can give a smaller space the appearance of more square footage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, a look at six o</span>pen concept kitchen ideas from <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten renovations that make kitchens the star of the remodel. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A soaring ceiling for the win</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="marble-countertop-kitchen-island"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="marble countertop on kitchen island with white cabinets and brown vinyl flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="1250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41789" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-240x300.jpg 240w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann looked for a contractor for two years to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update her dark and dated kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in East Hampton. She wanted a space that was welcoming and large enough to accommodate her family and guests. A place that felt open and airy and just enjoyable to be in. She finally pulled the trigger on the renovation after finding a contractor through Sweeten. They teamed up to create the bright, airy kitchen of Ann’s dreams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann knew she wanted the faux-brick backsplash and dark cabinetry replaced with lighter, more modern options. To go along with that contemporary update, Ann also decided to remove the wall between the dining area and cook space. But the ultimate game-changer was the detail her contractor recommended: a cathedral ceiling. Bumping up the ceiling added a feeling of spaciousness far above and beyond just taking down a wall. It gives the space a grand appearance and regal style. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just love having the open space, where everyone can sit and hang out together,” Ann said.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A galley kitchen opens up</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin lived in their Bronx home</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a year-and-a-half before they decided to renovate. It was time. They were tired of the small, inefficient 124-square-foot </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-make-a-galley-kitchen-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">galley kitchen.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They wanted more natural light. To make this happen, their Sweeten contractor took down the wall between the kitchen and entryway. He also removed a partial wall between the kitchen and dining, effectively connecting the two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="kitchen cabinet styles" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41638" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the kitchen was still on the smaller side, they had to get creative with storage. They included a peninsula breakfast bar that seats four to six and features additional storage. Glass-front cabinets, a microwave cabinet, and a built-in paper towel holder are all prime examples of their extra storage solutions. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the most of our floor space, have an open layout, and have comfortable dimensions for navigating the kitchen,” said Elizabeth. Mission accomplished.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Flooring that ties it all together</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49429" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many, living through the pandemic made</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amy and Kevin re-evaluate their living situation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The conclusion? It was time to make the move to get more space. So they purchased a 1950s home in Los Angeles, California. From the get-go, they knew it needed to be remodeled to fit their work-from-home lifestyle. In addition to turning two of their three bedrooms into office space, they wanted to rethink their kitchen and living room.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg" alt="custom kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49430" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their Sweeten contractor recommended widening the kitchen doorway and removing part of the six-foot wall to help the L-shaped kitchen flow. This opened the kitchen up to the living area. To unify the two spaces that were now one, they chose white-oak engineered hardwood in eight-inch planks. They felt this would showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel more cohesive. In addition, they created a nook for the refrigerator in the peninsula area. This gave them the additional room to add a large pantry—a must-have for most renovators. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result is a gorgeous home with space for both of us to do our things,” says Amy. “I’m so happy!”</span></p>
<h3><strong>A more kid-friendly remodel</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-peninsula-with-quartz-countertop"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Kitchen peninsula with quartz countertop and pendant lighting after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51253" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha is a stay-at-home mom and Jameson is an executive at a creative agency. They loved their Clinton Hill, Brooklyn co-op but it wasn’t optimal for their family of four. The couple wanted a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/kid-friendly-apartment-renovation-with-soundproofing-and-open-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">space that was more kid-friendly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out,” said Samantha. To achieve this they decided to renovate. They opened the kitchen to the living room. This way Samantha can see the family in the living room while she’s cooking in the kitchen. Plus, they added a breakfast counter with a cut-out. It serves as the perfect setting for homework—a win-win as Samantha can be doing dishes or prepping meals while she helps the kids with their school work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also rethought their old layout. They switched the dining area, which was previously by the window, with the living room sofa to make the table easily reachable. Samantha says her new open-concept kitchen is “an absolute pleasure.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>A tight New Jersey home gains valuable kitchen space</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45614" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this Sweeten renovator and his wife moved to Montclair, New Jersey, they knew <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the home they bought needed a lot</a> of updates. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was one of the first projects on their list. The house was almost a hundred years old and it looked its age. It was small, with “looming” cabinets all around. There were only eight feet of usable counter space. And the stove looked like it was out of a 1940s movie. Not to mention the cracked “McDonald&#8217;s” tiles (red terracotta tiles that are found in some older McDonald&#8217;s restaurants). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg" alt="New Jersey kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45621" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the renovation was to gain square footage and a better layout. Their Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plan was to tear down two walls. One had an old butler’s pantry. By removing it, they gained 18 square feet of space. That was enough to add an island. They also turned the unused cellar entryway into a walk-in pantry. The other wall that they removed was between the kitchen and dining room. Once it was down, the kitchen really took shape—their open-concept kitchen idea transformed the first floor with improved flow and natural light.</span></p>
<h3><strong>An open concept kitchen idea joins minimalism with functionalism</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-living-ding-in-one-stock"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen living and dining in one stock space and large window and hardwood floors and oak and white kitchen cabinets after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41453" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel loved <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Long Island City</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Queens, apartment, especially the 15-foot ceilings. They reveled in the natural light that beamed in. What they didn’t love, however, was the functionality or feel of their already-open kitchen. It didn’t match their Scandinavian style and had little to no counter space. They wanted a more open space with integrated appliances, clean lines, and minimal clutter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen.jpg" alt="wooden slab front kitchen cabinet door designs" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They worked with a Sweeten contractor and used the IKEA kitchen design tool to develop a new layout. The result is a gorgeous space with a walnut matte finish. The kitchen is seamlessly integrated into the living and dining area, with no walls to be seen anywhere. This open kitchen concept idea lets the family cook, dine, and hang out with ease all together. “It feels modern, calm, and welcoming,” said the couple. “It fits our needs and it feels like home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take a hard look at our homes. Many were grateful for the security and comfort our homes offered. But many more made note of the features that their homes lacked. At a time when almost half of the workforce was working from home and schools relied on distance learning, renovation projects became top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the renovation mindset may be a little different going forward. Jean Brownhill, the founder and CEO of Sweeten discussed the current state of renovation on <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sweeten-founder-jean-brownhill-on-new-rules-renovation/id1520457603?i=1000504585856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Time</a>,</em> a podcast hosted by <em>Domino</em> editor-in-chief Jessica Romm Perez. One trend they discussed is the emergence of practicality and functionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s goal is to make their finished project picture perfect. But to actually live in the space, other things may be more important. Here are some top projects Sweeten saw grow in popularity over the last year.</span></p>
<h3>Top COVID-19 renovation projects</h3>
<h4>Creating new living areas</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With people spending so much time at home, they adapted their living spaces to new uses. Many people upgraded their outdoor living areas by adding outdoor kitchens and other living spaces. Also, it wasn&#8217;t clear if a vacation away would be possible, so outdoor living space became more important. It also makes it possible to socialize with others if indoor entertaining isn’t an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because health clubs and gyms were closed, many people looked for ways to squeeze a workout space into their living areas. People <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-modern-basement-renovation-produces-a-clean-slate-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapted spare rooms or unfinished areas</a> like basements to create home gyms. </span></p>
<h4>Kitchen and bathroom remodels still in the spotlight</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen and bathroom renovations are still popular. Although kitchens have always had many uses, their multitasking ability became more important during the pandemic. Kids often did their remote learning there, and adults used them for makeshift home offices. That&#8217;s in addition to the regular cooking, eating, and cleaning that goes on in a kitchen. The National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in addition to upgraded appliances, there was an increase in requests for easy-to-clean surfaces, video watching ability, and device charging stations in the cook space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bathrooms became personal sanctuaries more than ever before. After a few weeks that turned into months into the pandemic, people came to value self-care more than ever. Even those who had not considered bath renovations undertook them to improve on their self-care routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bath update trends include oversized showers that feature multiple spray heads and body sprays, as well as a steam option. Voice commands can activate preset water temperatures and start music from a personal playlist. Ventilation fans do more than removing moisture: some have LED lighting that helps prevent mold growth. Others feature multi-color lights to change the mood of the room. Many spa-like features can be controlled by smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most renovations had in common was ease of maintenance. You can renovate a space that looks great, but you have to live in it. &#8220;I think that is one reason why porcelain tiles and planks are so popular,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They are easy to clean and they can be made to look like any material. &#8220;</span></p>
<h4>Reworking existing spaces</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, we can relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our work habits. The typical household can get hectic with everyone vying for counter space where they can work, as well as computer time. The problem was frequently solved by setting up work and play areas throughout the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean mentioned the trend of installing temporary glass panels in the home. These solve the noise problem that happens when someone is on a video call while someone else is unloading the dishwasher, other people are having a conversation, and kids are running around playing. Panels and interior windows give people acoustic separation. &#8220;We’re not looking for visual separation, but what we do want, and need, is acoustic separation,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closet organizing system that lets you store things neatly and efficiently may be of more use than a room straight out of the pages of a magazine. &#8220;As someone doing a renovation, you don&#8217;t rise to the level of your goals so much as you fall to the level of the systems you put in place,&#8221; said Jean. While we usually want our homes to look fashionable, the emphasis for homes was on function for 2020. </span></p>
<h4>Using unused space</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As floor plans were reconfigured, any unused or underutilized areas became prime real estate. Guest bedrooms became home offices or study lounges. But the real stars were spaces like basements, attics, and garages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attics became playrooms for children. Basements were also used as play areas, but many were converted to home gyms. Some drywall and flooring, and maybe a little weatherproofing, turned these storage areas into useful living spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, such as Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people are adding ADUs</a>. An ADU is short for accessory dwelling unit. It is a new living space added to an existing building. Garages are being converted to home offices, but also studio apartments. The apartments can be rented out in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presents new reasons to think creatively about our living spaces. Although we hope the pandemic will stay a once-in-a-lifetime event, we can all take cues from these COVID-19 renovation projects to inspire our own spaces at home.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchens are tight spaces, so, it helps to thoroughly plan every square foot before starting a remodel. Kitchens also are complex spaces where many elements must meet code. Supply and drain pipes compete with wires, ducts, and cabinets. The kitchen is not the place for last-minute, informal planning. Where should you start when considering different kitchen layout ideas? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Simply: homeowners should consider using the most common layouts found in kitchens. There are many benefits of starting with a tried-and-true layout in your kitchen: smooth traffic flow, and less wasted space. Additionally, kitchen functionalities</span><span class="s2">—sink, stove, fridge, and dishwasher—will end up in sensible places. Ultimately, this saves money for routing plumbing and electrical work. </span>Below you&#8217;ll find renovations by Sweeten homeowners with kitchen layout inspiration.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Island kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen with black island and ceiling height storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Anthony and Jeremiah&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/plywood-kitchen-is-loaded-with-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen island renovation</a></span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An island kitchen layout combines <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen island with other layouts</a>. These may be an L-shaped, U-shaped, or one-wall kitchen layout. The kitchen island is separate from the main counter area.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many kitchen islands are counters only, with no water or cooking action. If a service is added to the island, it’s usually a cooktop. Large island kitchens may have a cooktop and a second sink for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands may be used less frequently than the owner had originally imagined. So, it helps to add one of those services as a magnet. Or, some homeowners extend one end of the island for use as an eating bar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Additional counter space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Less expensive (you can even use a mobile island)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to bring water supply and drainage to an island<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Takes up a lot of space, so a large kitchen is required</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">U-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-30373 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" alt="u-shaped kitchen with gray cabinets and marble waterfall peninsula" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-shaped kitchen</a> remodel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A U-shaped kitchen layout expands the L-shaped layout by adding an extra wing. Instead of two counters, the U-shaped kitchen has three counters arranged like a U.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the U-shaped kitchen, various functions can be better spaced out than with the L-shaped layout. So, the leg of the L-shape that has the fridge, sink, and dishwasher can be broken up. The U-shaped kitchen’s third leg might contain the fridge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For a U-shaped kitchen, you’ll need to have enough floor space available, but not too much. If the space is too small, the kitchen is cramped. If it’s too large, it takes longer to walk from one area to another. The <a href="https://nkba.org/"><span class="s3">National Kitchen + Bath Association</span></a> recommends that no leg of the work triangle be less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the third wall<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Spreads out kitchen services<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficulty correctly sizing the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Center must be kept free of obstacles<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">One-wall kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Kitchen with blue cabinets and chevron backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tiffany and Chad&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/two-tone-blue-and-white-kitchen-has-first-class-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-wall kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the one-wall kitchen layout, all of the kitchen tasks are combined on a single counter against one wall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since they are all in a line, design is mainly a matter of deciding the order of the functionalities. Usually, the sink and dishwasher are next to each other to share the water supply and drain lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Of the 6 kitchen layout ideas, the U-shape works perfectly for smaller homes such as condos or apartments. However, you’ll want to keep the layout fairly short. This avoids too much movement from one end to the other end.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Squeezes kitchen into tiny space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Keeps plumbing and electrical in one area<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Too much walking if the layout is long<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Little counter space<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Galley kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheilaja + Sergio&#8217;s renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens have two counters that run parallel to each other. The counters are divided by a single aisle. Galley kitchens’ namesake is the kitchen found on boats. True to the inspiration, the aisle is usually narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With galley kitchens, often one leg is devoted to the stove or cooktop and counter space. The other leg is usually the home’s exterior wall and has the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens do a great job of confining the workflow to a tight space. Just make sure that the cabinet, fridge, dishwasher, and oven doors don’t conflict with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Tucks kitchen away, off to the side<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short traffic pattern<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Poor layout for multiple people in the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Doors may conflict or open into each other<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Peninsula kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20126 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg" alt="peninsula kitchen layout with see-through kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dalal + Frans&#8217; renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A peninsula kitchen layout is a U-shaped layout that has a counter extension. Located at either end of the U shape, the extension partially juts into the kitchen. The result is generally a G-shape.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This kitchen usually retains its activities in its U-shaped section. The extension then becomes a breakfast bar or eating counter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The outer part of the extension can take two or three chairs for eating. The inner (kitchen side) is less functional. Most of it becomes a blind-corner cabinet that’s difficult for storing items. One solution is to install a lazy-susan, swing-out, or pull-out in that corner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the end of a run of cabinets<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Room for eating saves on the need for chairs and table<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Creates another blind-corner cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short counter<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No matter the size of your home, there’s a kitchen layout that&#8217;ll fit the space. Keep in mind the kitchen activities that are important to your lifestyle, plot the best layout and flow, and get ready for your dream cook space.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An L-shaped kitchen layout has two counters laid at a 90-degree angle to each other. Often, one counter is longer than the other counter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The L-shaped kitchen layout usually divides the kitchen activities across the two legs of the L-shape. One leg may have the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher. The other leg may have the stove or cooktop, plus a majority of the counter space for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons that an L-shaped kitchen layout is a good idea for your home.<span class="s1"> For one, L-shaped kitchens are flexible enough to fit in kitchens of different sizes. For another, this layout lends itself perfectly to the <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kitchen-triangle-best-way-to-design-a-kitchen"><span class="s3">concept of the kitchen triangle</span></a>. With this, the sink, stove, and fridge are arranged in a triangle for better workflow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Flexible, works for many kitchens<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Good use of the kitchen triangle<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Large kitchens can get too spread out<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to find space for counter eating</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Start with the right kitchen layout ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">Cooking in a space with the right floorplan can prove to be the result of a well-planned kitchen remodel. With workflows in mind, everything from preparing ingredients to cleaning up can be done in a more streamlined fashion. The &#8220;work triangle” reduces the number of steps needed to move between the appliances. By having the right design, you are on your way to an enjoyable cooking experience.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen layouts</h3>
<h4><b>How to design a kitchen layout?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing the right kitchen layout is dependent upon the homeowner and the home. When choosing a kitchen layout, the homeowner first has to recognize what space they are working with. They should also think about what they need in their kitchen, and what will be the most useful to them. Would it be best for the kitchen to have an open layout? Or, should it include an island or peninsula? The homeowner has to think of the pros and cons, but also what is actually possible. A small galley kitchen is not going to fit a big island, while a big L-shaped kitchen might look empty without one.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is the best layout for a small kitchen?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-wall layout</a>, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula layout</a> work all well for small kitchens. A galley kitchen can be tucked away in tight spaces, and there is a short traffic pattern. Including a peninsula in the kitchen means that there does not have to be room for a table and chairs. Stools can be added to the peninsula in order to make a tabletop. A one-wall kitchen layout makes it so everything in the kitchen can be compact on one side, and may open up into a living area. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="outdoor-swimming-pool-brown-deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res-723x480.jpg" class="mb-10" alt="outdoor swimming pool and brown deck area with furniture after renovation" width="723" height="480" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dennis</a></span></p>
<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stone-counter-granite-countertop" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg" alt="stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4277#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40864" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Give a generic Jersey City kitchen a modern-industrial twist</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every kitchen in a pencil-factory-turned-apartment complex in Jersey City, New Jersey, had the same look: brown cabinets, tan tiles, and black countertops. But homeowners Becky and Paul (and their two cats), who’d been living in their two-bedroom apartment almost three years, wanted their cook space to stand out. Their 120-square-foot galley kitchen had a workable layout and thanks to a look-through window, was also connected to the living space. It just needed a refresh of the fixtures and materials, plus more storage. The couple </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40861" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The first-time renovators got to work with their general contractor to select materials and appliances.  “If we chose something he thought from a professional standpoint wouldn’t work, he would not only explain why but have alternative options for us to review,” they shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were aiming for a bright and airy look with touches of industrial elements to align with their building style, which they achieved with white cabinets, a glossy backsplash, and pops of stainless steel in the faucet and farmhouse sink. The blue wall makes the room appear bigger and lighter, too.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40867 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="653" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-300x196.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood-like tile floor (a growing trend in kitchen upgrades), floating wood shelves, and a corner of butcher block countertop add a natural appeal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the kitchen’s coolest new features: a built-in wine rack just above the sink that takes advantage of what would otherwise be empty space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong communication between the contractor and homeowners contributed to the successful completion of the project. If issues cropped up, like delayed deliveries, that would affect timing or cost, the contractor contacted the homeowners right away and found solutions quickly. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a newbie in renovation, this level of communication and education was greatly appreciated. He was also such a champion for us when ordering materials and always put his clients&#8217; needs first when working with vendors,” they shared. The renovators didn’t run into any major issues, though their friendly cats did try to lend a paw throughout the process. On workdays, Becky and Paul set them up in their bedroom to keep them out of the construction zone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten Client Services also just checked in throughout the project to make sure the process was going smoothly. “We could not be more grateful to have such a terrific support system,&#8221; they shared.</span></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Improve the layout and look of a drab Jersey City kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Anne wanted to wait to move into her Jersey City co-op apartment until she renovated the kitchen. After six years of renting, she bought the apartment knowing it would need some work. “I saw 35 finished apartments that just were not ‘me,’ so I was very open to the idea of purchasing a place that needed a little work to make it my own,” she said. Having grown up with a family very comfortable with renovations, Anne was more than ready to take on a project. On her wish list? A kitchen layout optimized for cooking, with plenty of natural light and a mix of traditional and modern details. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29534">posted her project on Sweeten</a> and after considering her matches chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260">Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37363 size-full" title="anne-posing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="anne standing in her kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: In order to make the best use of the small space, a wall with a cut-out into the living room (and that housed appliances) came down. Knocking it down allowed more light to come into the living room from the window over the sink. Otherwise, the footprint remained the same, with the kitchen sink and dishwasher on one wall, the stove on another.</p>
<p>The builder-grade cabinets were swapped with white shaker cabinets, adding the traditional touch Anne was aiming for. “I picked tall cabinets that went all the way up to the ceiling, and my contractor installed trim at the top to make them look custom,” she said. A classic subway tile backsplash and quartz countertops tied the whole look together. New hardwood flooring in both the kitchen and living area united the space.</p>
<p>A few roadblocks came up during the project, such as outdated electrical and plumbing, but Anne’s contractor handled it all—without delaying the estimated completion time. “The biggest thing that was important for me was to have a timeline that worked. My rental lease was up and I needed a place to live,” she said. Anne was able to move in right on time and start enjoying her new kitchen. Selecting the new cabinets and counters was her favorite part of the process, as was seeing it come together over the weeks of renovation. “It’s extremely rewarding to see how great everything turned out and having your own space that is exactly how you would want it!&#8221;</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Add more storage and bring a kitchen up to date</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Kate and Matt loved Jersey City and their home, but were more than ready to refresh their kitchen. Cheap ‘80s-era cabinets were showing their age and the storage situation was dire. The galley set-up also limited their options to expand and create a more cook-friendly space. Kate’s main ask, besides a completely new look, was a breakfast bar. “I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,” she said, “so I really craved a little spot in which to sit.” <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19777">She posted her project on Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3189">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-white-countertop"  class="alignnone wp-image-30957 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg" alt="beige kitchen cabinets and white countertop in a kitchen with brown floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Luckily, the galley layout proved less of an obstacle than anticipated. She worked with her Sweeten contractor, settling on a built-in breakfast bar at the far end of the kitchen, just above the stairs. The couple worried about the potential for things to fall of the ledge to the floor below, but their contractor&#8217;s recommendation of a raised back on the bar eliminated their concern.</p>
<p>The good fortune continued, as they discovered during demolition the soffits that were taking up valuable wall space were empty. They were removed, and taller upper cabinets installed. To make the galley kitchen feel brighter, the couple chose light materials for the countertops and backsplash to counteract the new gray cabinets.  Their contractor also moved the refrigerator and dishwasher, optimizing the layout for more storage options.</p>

The room was closed off to the rest of the living spaces. The renovation plan was to keep the square footage the same so as to not disturb any architectural details with expansion. However, breaking through the wall for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-kitchen-pass-through-gets-social-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass-through breakfast bar</a> was the solution to open the space up to the living room.

Adding to the galley kitchen’s character was a cozy eat-in dining niche.</span></p><h3>A single wall of cabinets suits a narrow galley kitchen</h3><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20690 size-full" title="galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maximize Jenna’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/making-way-for-a-nursery-and-more-in-this-duplex-apartment-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narrow galley kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a run of upper and base cabinets sit along one wall, and face a flush refrigerator and uncluttered wall.

They instead used that extra space to take advantage of the room’s length and install lower cabinets all the way to the window wall. To make it feel even bigger, they opted for one long wood shelf opposite the wall of upper cabinets.</span></p><h3>Clever idea: shallow cabinets save space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37242 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Inwood kitchen renovation, remodel, after, design, construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra and Michael overhauled their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/sustainable-remodel-inwood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing galley kitchen layout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add more cabinet and counter space. They chose narrow base cabinets (basically wall cabinets) to save the square footage without making it feel more cramped.</span></p><h3>Relocating a bulky fridge frees up valuable space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23887 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In Hari and Kaity’s galley kitchen the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator placement</a> minimized counter space and the surrounding walls made the whole space tight. They relocated it to a spot a few feet outside of the kitchen walls. A cutout in the wall at the entrance also helped free up space. Pro tip: if you’re unsure about taking down walls, moving your refrigerator can be an alternative to free up space while preserving the existing layout.</p><h3>A galley kitchen puts dead space to use</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="galley kitchen with blue walls and granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten homeowner Rashmi had no interest in an open kitchen when it was time to renovate.

To save space, shallower 18” kitchen cabinets were installed on one side. Closer to the entry, a narrow eat-in bar that was an extension from the countertop in the kitchen fit two stools. Opposite the bar, Rashmi installed built-in cabinets for storage and a washer and dryer.

The ideal distance between the two walls is four to six feet, which helps to maximize efficiency and workflow. Homeowners with smaller kitchens–meaning less than 90 square feet–would benefit from a galley kitchen layout.</p></div>

					<div id="elementor-tab-content-2642" class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elementor-tab-title-2642"><p class="p1">There are several ways to make a galley kitchen’s hallway-like appearance look bigger. First, using built-in refrigerators and dishwashers–which are only 24 inches deep–creates a seamless, flush line between appliances and cabinets. This eliminates protruding handles or edges. Second, choose your color palette wisely. Light-colored cabinets, like white, gray, and agave, make small spaces look bigger, as do glossy, reflective surfaces. Third, talk to a contractor about adding a pass-through window. These open up the space and allow for guests to mingle while the hosts prepare food. Lastly, look at the overall placement of your cabinets and appliances. Move bulky items, like fridges, away from the kitchen entrance as these can create visual barriers to the space and make it look smaller.</p></div>

Alternatively, it can be installed overhead elsewhere in the kitchen. Separating the appliances help with flow and movement if more than one cook is working in the space. Drawer-style microwaves can also be placed in lower cabinets and functions as a pull-out.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A closed-in footprint cracks wide open with a floor plan change, a dramatic tile backsplash, and a new dining area</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25802 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen with tile backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Modernizing and improving flow in an awkward kitchen in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: This Sweeten homeowner purchased a two-bedroom co-op apartment in Clinton Hill about a year and a half before posting his project to Sweeten. Although the kitchen was functional, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layout</a> was not ideal. There was a mishmash of storage, none of which was adequate, and walls lacked definition without a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile backsplash</a>. Only a small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> provided the bulk of the work surface. He also wanted to add built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a> for additional storage. With all of this in mind, the homeowner—a first-time renovator—enlisted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> to convert his vision into reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: A bright, contemporary kitchen in subtle tones pairs perfectly with a coral accent wall that runs along one side of the kitchen and through the living room. A glass tile backsplash in a mosaic of gray shades is the star of the show. By choosing stainless steel appliances, white cabinets, silver hardware, and a medium gray quartz countertop, the homeowner created a clean backdrop for both the tile backsplash as well as for it to coordinate with the home&#8217;s open plan. Given that the new base cabinetry—with many deep drawers—provide plenty of hidden storage, chunky white shelving was installed instead of upper cabinets for a feeling of openness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: By reconfiguring the kitchen from a U-shape to a galley setup, the Sweeten contractor made way for a dining space with an ample-sized table that easily seats 6 (or more!), and is directly in front of the kitchen’s large window to boot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Style finds</b></span>: Glass mosaic backsplash, white flat-front cabinets, gray quartz countertops, silver cabinet hardware.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Revamping a kitchen&#8217;s original floor plans can take your space from workable to wow!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a major kitchen transformation is your wish, going beyond swapping out kitchen cabinets or simply replacing existing features, you&#8217;ll want to enlist an architect to make changes to your floor plans.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Architects can see potential in the bleakest and most uninspiring places: Where we see darkness, they see spaces capable of being filled with natural light; where we see dead space and awkward cabinetry, they see new configurations and storage solutions. Whether you decide to work with an independent architect and a general contractor to execute your vision, or hire a design and build firm that can provide both architectural and construction services, chances are you won’t recognize your beautiful new kitchen once it’s done. Read on for five Sweeten kitchens that underwent an about-face in the best possible way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24795 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry and Janet’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Crown Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to find a fixer-upper that had a “bring your architect” vibe, Jerry and Janet came across a historic rowhouse that needed major work. After finding an architecture firm, as well as a general contractor, on Sweeten, they set their sights on updating the severely outdated home. New electrical, plumbing, and gas heating were installed throughout the rowhouse, followed by the framing of walls to create new floor plans. The kitchen was relocated to connect both the living and dining room, improving the flow of the home. Since the couple likes to cook, the space was laid out to allow ease of movement with plenty of counter space, and gray-toned IKEA cabinetry was installed to maximize storage space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24796 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A spacious one-bedroom with loads of potential led Joel and Eric to Sweeten to find a general contractor for their renovation. One of their contractor’s references turned out to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners and designers Casey and Kumar</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who were brought on board to design the new space. The 1920’s-era apartment had a sunken living room, high ceilings, and lots of ornamental details—as well as a kitchen that was too small and dark. Updates to the floor plans were necessary, starting with a plan to connect the living room to the kitchen. Casey came up with the idea for a unified countertop, a piece that would serve as a bridge between the two rooms with a wraparound counter and plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> underneath. The peninsula allowed the kitchen to feel much more open and inviting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24797 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="1085" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris’ kitchen</a> in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lia and Chris came to Sweeten to make over their two-bedroom, top floor unit with high ceilings, tons of light, and spectacular views. They chose to work with a design and build firm to address the outdated, open plan kitchen that looked out to the living room. The result provided more counter and storage space, filled in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hid the fridge</a> for a more streamlined look. By far the most exciting part of the design included opening up the ceiling and exposing building beams in the living room for an industrial look, with the last exposed beam acting as a visual separation between the two spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20833 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s kitchen</a> on the Upper West Side, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natural light was not an issue in Sophia and Leon’s three-bedroom apartment—they had three exposures during the day that received a ton of light, but none of it ever made it into the kitchen due to its “bento box” layout. Working with a design and build firm that they found through Sweeten, they took down unnecessary walls that completely cut off the kitchen. The new floor plans included a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-built</a>, open kitchen between the living room and dining room, allowing light to flow through the entire apartment. Open shelving on one side of the kitchen helped transition the space into the living area with storage for books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="483" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p>Not wanting a cookie-cutter apartment, architect Tina was drawn to a two-bedroom garden duplex with high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room, a space that she was excited to customize for her family. With the couple’s first child on the way, any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work were eliminated in order to cut down on both the permit approval and construction timelines. Tina completed her architectural drawings before meeting with contractors and decided to work with a Sweeten contractor who proposed an ambitious six-week timeline. Her main goal: to create an open kitchen by removing a floating, non-structural wall that had separated the space from the living room. New cabinets were continued around a corner, transforming the space from a narrow galley into an L-shape complete with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom kitchen island</a>. Semi-custom cabinets were designed around the existing appliances and maximized storage vertically.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple creates their dream home with walnut wood floors, a spa bath, and enough kitchen storage to turn heads</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A year-long search—involving a specially-written code!—led Jonathan, a consultant, and Cecilia, a social media strategist and <a href="https://cecibeautytherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">beauty blogger</span></a>, to a mid-century co-op apartment in Queens. The unit was in a serious state of disrepair, with cracked doors and windows and a dangerously unstable kitchen countertop. Read about how the couple changed the floor plan, turned a powder room into a full spa bath, and created a space to suit their lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Prior to moving in together, Jonathan and his girlfriend, Cecilia, were each living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. The criteria for their search? He wanted a large space and a fixer upper with a good school district; she wanted the convenience of a supermarket, shops, and a subway stop close by. Their budget had them looking in Windsor Terrace, Forest Hills, Sunnyside, and Hamilton Heights, in addition to Elmhurst. For their search, Jonathan used his background in quantitative finance to adapt code that he had written to find his first apartment in 2008, which scoured the major real estate websites for properties that fit their fairly strict criteria and price range. The code took into account various factors, such as home value increase over time, new developments, transit efficiency, growth in commercial investments, and the neighborhood’s increasing value over five-plus years. When this apartment came up—roughly a year after they started searching—it was way under budget, and the couple pounced on the opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The space was located in a very convenient neighborhood in Elmhurst, with shops and necessities nearby and just a 25-minute subway ride from midtown. They purchased the 1960s-era apartment with the intention to renovate. The reasonable price meant there was enough left over to splurge on the renovations, so they planned to add their own personal touch with high-end finishes. At roughly 1,300 square feet, the 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op was more space than they expected to find, and the layout allowed them to implement some drastic changes to make the space more usable.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and Cecilia could see that the apartment had good bones. Despite the positives, it was extremely outdated and many things—such as the cabinets, heaters, windows, and doors—were falling apart. The kitchen counter would teeter if you placed any weight on it, and would even come off its foundation if you pressed down. The previous owners had done unpermitted renovations in the past, and the apartment had not been well taken care of. The original layout had long narrow halls, closets in weird places, a closed kitchen, and cramped rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Initially, Jonathan looked for contractors on his own, until an architect friend told him about Sweeten. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">He posted his project</span></a> and wrote up his description. He said, “I received a lot of quick responses—more than me going out on my own, and the bids were much more competitive than any from my own research. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor</span></a> that I went with was a one-stop shop for everything. He had an architect, a designer, and a project manager—they pretty much did all the heavy lifting. They were super responsive and took care of a lot of the issues that arose throughout the process. Knowing that they have been vetted through Sweeten definitely gave me peace of mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and his Sweeten contractor set out to solve problems related to space usability and efficiency, and to make the apartment feel more open and modern. They decided that if a wall could be knocked down, they would do it. They turned hallways into closets and closets into open spaces. They also wanted to convert the half bath into a second full bath—Cecilia already claimed the first one, so Jonathan needed one of his own!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24322 size-chrono" title="before kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="before kitchen" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24321 size-chrono" title="during renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="during renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24325 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24324 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Given their preference for clean lines with modern touches, they did not want too much in terms of the built-ins and crown molding. “The kitchen was the part of the renovation we were most excited about. Because Cecilia loves to cook and I like to entertain, we wanted people to naturally gather around the kitchen for good food, good drinks, and good times,” says Jonathan. With dark furniture in the rest of the apartment, they went for white shaker cabinets, gray-white texture on the backsplash and white counters with a bit of speckling for an overall contrasting look. Appliances were stainless steel and marble was installed wherever possible. An incredible amount of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> and counter space was added, with every inch of space maximized.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24327 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24326 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A pull-out spice rack</a> and deep drawers were among the storage solutions they chose. “Having those large drawers for pots and pans with the ability to customize the holders was a must. A floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers made our snacking life that much easier. We decided on open shelving in select areas to make the kitchen feel more open. A pass-through was also created, so a spot on the living room side was used for counter seating. We wanted large appliances to really be the wow factor in our kitchen. I love our five-burner stove—especially the griddle!—and our massive fridge and great dishwasher. Having this generously proportioned kitchen and large-scale appliances has been amazing, especially compared to our previous apartments,” explains Jonathan.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original full bath—Cecilia’s bathroom—they went with a white theme. She wanted it to be bright and classy, so they chose glossy white marble <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile for the floors</a> and large-format porcelain tile for the walls, with an accent wall of marble 2-inch subway tile laid in a herringbone pattern. This gave the space more texture and made it feel more custom. They also added a niche for toiletries and bath products.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24333 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24334 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second bath, Jonathan added a large shower by taking some space from the master bedroom closet. “Since it was my bathroom, I had full reign and wanted it to resemble a spa.” The Sweeten contractor added slate tiles throughout, as well as a pebbled shower floor and a large shower panel with rainfall and waterfall features. In both baths, they installed tankless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilets</a> per co-op requirements.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-03-04-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24378 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-03-04-2.gif" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24335 mb-0 size-chrono" title="office renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="office renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Throughout the apartment, they had originally planned on going with light bamboo flooring. When their Sweeten design/build firm sent over samples of both light and dark wood, however, they fell in love with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark walnut flooring</a> from Triangulo. For the office space, they decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French doors</a> to allow some openness between the living room and office, while providing privacy if needed when Jonathan worked from home in the evenings.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest challenges of the project related to changes to their original design: “A lot of it was due to unforeseen circumstances,&#8221; Jonathan explains. &#8220;The original broker stretched the truth about where pipes were, what construction was done legally, what was underneath the floors, as well as what we would be permitted to do. We originally had a plan that was going to be signed off, but once we contacted the live-in super, problems started to arise. We had to do two to three different drafts, which caused scheduling delays as well as caused friction with the co-op board and staff. The entire process took about two months just to get approval because of these issues. Eventually, we got everything set up, and once construction started, there were only a few slight hiccups. Everything went fairly smoothly.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After finishing the renovation, Jonathan’s recommendation to future renovators is to be open and flexible with the initial vision. “Most people have an idea of how exactly they want things, and are unwilling to do something different or new. That’s good but rarely does your budget or space allow you to have everything that you want. I originally wanted to remove some of our closets because I thought we had too many, but my girlfriend and designer suggested that we keep them for both value and utility. Having lived here for six months, I can safely say that I’m glad we kept the closets.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan feared that the end product wouldn’t match up to his vision. He and Cecilia have very different design aesthetics, and he wasn’t sure if they would mesh well together. “In the end, I think the apartment has a good flow and calming color tones, which is something nice to come home to after a hectic day. Another big question I had was whether we could actually do everything in the timeframe the contractors set out—about four to five months. It was an ambitious schedule, and while there were small items that needed to be addressed after we moved in, they were minor. In the end, we completed the project on deadline, and are very happy with how it turned out.”</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: </span><span class="s1">Meredith and Jason’s apartment building in Chelsea was comprised of four townhouses that had been combined. The result was a kitchen with plenty of issues: Dark mahogany cabinets obscured the only window, blocking precious natural light. The kitchen island in a too-small space meant you could only walk around it if you brushed yourself up against a wall. A slightly raised floor made for regular toe-stubbing if you weren’t paying attention. A kitchen renovation was definitely in order.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: </span><span class="s1">The couple took some time getting an idea of what they wanted. Meredith took ownership of the aesthetics and Jason, the family cook, focused on creating a functional space. Despite the awkward island, Meredith still liked the idea of having one. After wrestling with the design, their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor</span></a> suggested a wide peninsula. &#8220;As soon as I saw the drawing, I was on board with it,” said Meredith. This helped double the counter space and gives her a place to sit and work while Jason prepares dinner. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood floor</a> was lowered an inch, eliminating the risk to toes, and now matches the rest of the apartment, making the kitchen feel “bigger, brighter and cleaner,” she said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom cabinetry</a> freed the window for maximum natural light. The microwave was placed under the peninsula rather than above the range so Jason could install his dream <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hood</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: </span><span class="s1">The ceiling dropped about a foot in the old kitchen and a previous contractor said it could not be lifted. When their Sweeten contractor came in and found a way to lift it about seven inches, it was a big relief for the couple.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to maximize space at home: use transom windows, pocket doors, custom walls and more</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-interior-wall-of-windows-brings-light-to-this-guest-alcove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeksha and Joe&#8217;s</a> windowed wall and guest bedroom.</p>
<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>

<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frans and Dalal&#8217;s</a> movable partitions and multipurpose spaces.</p>
<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deanna and Daria&#8217;s</a> two-bedroom transformation</p>
<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23448 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/lindsay-and-matts-sweetened-brooklyn-coop-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay and Matt&#8217;s</a> nursery.</p>
<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From ranges and dishwashers to refrigerators, here are appliances that fit small-space kitchens like a (rubber) glove</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23398 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Manhattan kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02" width="723" height="485" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-600x402.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span><span class="img-label"> (Above) A 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range in Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manhattan renovation</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-10 size-chrono" title="small space appliances" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08-723x1085.gif" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Last year, Lindsay and Tim bought their first home together<i>—</i>a sprawling two-bedroom apartment on Central Park West. The couple—a medical student and financial analyst, respectively—saw the potential to create an incredible home for themselves, but had a list of renovation items to tackle first. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, they created a classic but thoroughly contemporary apartment with room to grow. By updating their existing kitchen and baths, they carved out new spaces for living, working, and entertaining. Read on for how they reconfigured walls to add an expanded office, a half bath, </i><em>AND bonus storage space </em><i>to their prewar apartment! </i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing our first apartment together in June of 2016, my wife, Lindsay, and I decided to take on a co-op renovation in order to make it our perfect living space. We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The “before” layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.001" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.002" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen. With the help of Sweeten, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and went with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Manhattan renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing the entrance from a narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room—formerly small storage space—was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of design, we wished to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace and the walls between the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able to build a third bedroom/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our en-suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23307 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="1084" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23308 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through. </span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end, we decided to add extras along the way, which extended the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor did his best to complete these while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.</span><span class="s2"> The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Make a Brooklyn kitchen feel inviting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snug like a ship, a galley kitchen will maximize function in the smallest of spaces. Renovating an efficient galley layout can be as simple as upgrading appliances, lighting, and architectural details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The room was earth-toned and hardly the apartment owner’s style. Its dated ceramic floor tile was a drab-looking tan and had been laid with wide grout joints that collected dirt. An uninspired backsplash with ugly, inexpensive accent tiles came down onto a counter that looked like mud-speckled granite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The owners love cooking and entertaining, so they worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor</a> to remodel not just for function but also to make the kitchen more welcoming. Walls have been brightened with white paint, as has the old radiator cover beneath the window. New white cabinets are taller than the former ones, and a small soffit conceals the leftover space above, simplifying the lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crisp white subway tile updates the backsplash, and floor tiles were replaced with resilient material. Under-cabinet lighting supplements new halogen track lighting in the center of the ceiling. The stainless steel stove has a stainless combination hood-and-microwave above, and the new dishwasher is a pleasant addition. Cabinets now surround an efficient stainless french-door fridge; its freezer drawer conserves the cool air that otherwise would be lost when you open the door of a side-by-side model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a bonus, creative space planning allowed the owners to repurpose an adjacent windowed alcove as a second bedroom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Since none of the finishes or fixtures in the apartment are worth saving and the layout is somewhat awkward, without a real kitchen or closet space, the best strategy is to gut the interior and begin with a clean slate</p>
<p>The apartment would benefit most from a more open layout, to bring light from the rear windows deeper into the interior.   In addition there are some practical considerations.  There&#8217;s the need for a real kitchen, with adequate counter space and storage. There&#8217;s the need for closet and storage space.  And it&#8217;s best to keep the kitchen and bathroom located where they are, close to the existing plumbing, gas and sewage lines.</p>
<p>The design can go in many different directions, depending on the owner&#8217;s lifestyle and priorities.  Here are some basic ideas:</p>
<p>FOR AN ENTREPENEUR</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone with her own business, or who sometimes works from home, this scheme builds an 8&#8242;-0&#8243; long work station along the right side of the apartment.  It has a continuous wood work counter, drawers and file cabinets below, and shelving on the wall above.  From here the owner can sit and work without distractions.  When she&#8217;s done, she can clear her things from the counter and the space stays tidy and well-organized, separate from rest of the apartment.</p>
<p>The entire apartment remains open.  At the back is the living and dining area.  At the middle is a bed and a clothing closet.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A FASHIONISTA</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who cares deeply about fashion, this scheme has a walk in closet with plenty of room for her to keep her clothing and a place where she can get dressed in the morning.  The closet has racks for garments and shelving for shoes, bags and accessories.  There&#8217;s a window for natural light, and room for a chair and a vanity table or standing mirror too.</p>
<p>The remaining space in back becomes a sleeping alcove. The center of the apartment becomes a living area, with built in bookshelves and cabinets.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A GOURMET</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who likes to  cook and entertain, this scheme has a full-size kitchen and a formal dining room.  The double galley kitchen provides plenty of counter and storage space, and room for two or three people to be cooking and prepping at one time.  The dining room is large enough to seat six or eight people.</p>
<p>The back becomes a living area with a fold-out bed.  At the front, near the entry, are the bathroom, a clothes closet and a linen closet.</p>
<p>Any of these layouts could be converted to a proper one-bedroom  by closing off the sleeping area.  This is something that&#8217;s possible but that I would try to work around.  Closing off a bedroom might make the rooms, especially those near the entrance, feel small and dark.</p>
<p>This apartment has a footprint that lends itself to many different layouts.  I&#8217;m very excited to see what choices the owner will make as she sweetens the space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1095 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>
