<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancé, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a> and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge.</span></i>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to work—her x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor’s keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractor’s desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall short—wrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshua’s eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="white kitchen walnut built ins" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22216" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22222" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog.jpg" alt="Open shelving for spice storage" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23735" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sides—four very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. I’d notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. “Just think of it like camping,” Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted. &#8220;Don’t worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;You’re gonna love it.”  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, “I didn’t realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.” We couldn’t relish it more!</span></p>
