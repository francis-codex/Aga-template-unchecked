										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Whether they work simultaneously or on different timelines, their goal is one and the same</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind every renovation is a hardworking team that’s striving for one thing: executing a successful project. Homeowners come to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who can reimagine their homes and sometimes bring along an interior designer who can help them visualize the new space. Other times, interior designers come directly to Sweeten to hire a general contractor for their clients’ projects. How a designer and contractor work together on a project varies case-by-case, sometimes they’re involved from the get-go, and other times a designer will come in post-construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“General contractors are essential to our work,” said <a href="https://www.nysid.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSID</a> faculty member Harry Heissmann. “While we can dream up and lay out rooms and houses, we need help executing our vision and while all of us are perfectly capable of supervising a job, the GC takes a lot of pressure off and organizes the different trades on a job according to a schedule. I always create an atmosphere of mutual respect right at the beginning, which in turn can make miracles happen.” See how these renovators partnered with a general contractor and designer to create their home sweet homes. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A dream came true for actor Danielle Brooks, who plays Taystee on the Netflix hit show <em>Orange is the New Black</em>: She owned her first home by the age of 30. Eager to make her mark in her new Brooklyn brownstone, she approached interior design duo, Jeanine Hays and Bryan Mason of <a href="https://www.aphrochic.com/">AphroChic</a> to meld her love of color, her draw to cultural heritage, and her sense of glamour. With a vision in place, the designers tapped Sweeten to find a general contractor who would set the stage with distinct Moroccan lighting, a sultry master bedroom painted in black, and African-inspired art. </span></p>
<p><i><span><img decoding="async" title="beige-walls-white-doors" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42245 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors.jpg" alt="beige walls and white doors in a bedroom with white chest of drawers after renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors-600x415.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors-585x405.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Dianna and Todd’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation on the Upper West Side</a></span></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Dianna and Todd had long been planning to renovate their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">440-square-foot apartment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a roof-top blaze is what got their plans underway. They came to Sweeten to find a general contractor who amongst many things, advised on where to focus their attention, from refreshing the cabinetry instead of replacing it, to restaining and sanding the existing wood floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the renovation was complete, they brought in interior designer Julia Oddo of </span><a href="https://www.tcinteriordesign.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Interiors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who created a scheme to complement the material choices—tans, blacks, and whites—the couple had already made with their contractor. In this case, the designer and the contractor were not working hand-in-hand throughout the project, but still wanted to create a great home for their client.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica traded a Pepto-pink bathroom for a blush and chic retreat. Her renovation team, a Sweeten general contractor and interior designer </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy E. Bishop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined forces to revamp her Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, bath. Amy came up with design ideas, like the cascading statement wall and in-shower shelving, while the contractor brought them to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, the built-in shelves were supposed to be on a different wall, but after the contractor discovered the wall was solid cement, the team reconsidered the location, moving the niches to the back wall instead. The renovation was a collaboration between all parties and resulted in a relaxing space for Erica.</span></p>

Originally, the kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area, making it dark and cramped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to knock down the walls and let the light in from the living room windows. A mix of reflective and refractive materials help harness that light, too. Danielle, the principal and founder of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persephone Spring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked hand-in-hand with the contractor to translate the vision, and select finishes from paint color to tile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowners’ </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/kips-bay-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three-bedroom apartment in the Kips Bay Towers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been through a renovation before, but thirty years later the time had come for another refresh. The owners’ called on interior designer </span><a href="https://tarabenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tara Benet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who then turned to Sweeten to hire a contractor to refresh what had become a tired and outdated space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From refinishing the floors to repainting the walls a slightly orange-tinted white and touching up millwork, the Sweeten general contractor created a new canvas for Tara to embellish with luxe furniture, lighting, and accessories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing designers Casey and Kumar’s (of </span><a href="https://www.studiomilleratre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Miller Atre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) </span>own renovation<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Sweeten blog, Melissa and Russ came to Sweeten to hire the contractor the duo used for their project, and the designers themselves. Melissa and Russ were inspired by the seamlessly integrated kitchen they’d designed and their unique approach to open layouts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Miller Atre conceived an idea that made each space feel distinct but connected and the general contractor executed their vision, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building out custom cabinetry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and covering up once-exposed brick walls.</span></p>
