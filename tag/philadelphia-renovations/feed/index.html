<h3 class="p5">Living with a yesteryear Philadelphia bathroom</h3>
<p><i>Tiny pink south Philly row home bathroom needs a complete renovation,</i> our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> project post read. We attached photos, featuring not only the Pepto-toned tiles, but teal-colored rugs and seashell wallpaper. They’d been photographed three years earlier, but little had changed—proof that the project was way overdue. The bathroom hadn’t been renovated since the home was built in 1920.</p>
<p class="p6"><i><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg" alt="Portrait of Sweeten homeowners" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></i></p>
<p class="p6">We’re Kait and Patrick, former renters who jumped to buy a fixer-upper as we watched housing prices tick up in our ideal Philadelphia neighborhoods. When we purchased our 1,400-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">row house in the southern Point Breeze/Newbold</a> area a few years ago, we completed renovations including laying new floors, adding central air, skim-coating and painting the walls, and installing a new kitchen. But we didn’t have the budget to renovate the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Learning from past renovations</h3>
<p class="p6">As anyone can see, the bathroom was ugly. The floor tile didn’t coordinate with the walls. Everything was old and stained; no amount of cleaning made it look presentable. But it was our only bathroom (unless you count the creepy basement toilet and slop sink). When the time came to remodel it, our immediate priorities were practical: finding a contractor who could complete the project in a reasonable amount of time and without sacrificing the quality of materials or workmanship.</p>
<p class="p6"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg" alt="Split images of the bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52404" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p6"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom with pink walls and wooden vanity" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52392" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p6">Then there was the goal: To create something that would feel like a sanctuary. With that vision in mind, we put a lot of effort into interviewing contractors who responded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/86002#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten project posting</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6178#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>. In our last renovation, honestly, we had terrible experiences. Like with the contractor who demolished our kitchen so prematurely that we lived without a kitchen for eight months. We were determined to prevent another debacle like that.</p>
<p class="p6">The bathroom was chaotic and we lived with it for a long time, but the chance to improve it came sooner than expected. After twice canceling our wedding due to Covid, we eloped and put the money saved towards the bathroom project. Our families and friends were generous with wedding gifts, further helping us fund the job.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p6">The small-spaced bathroom stays small</h3>
<p class="p6">From the first planning phases, we knew we would have no layout changes. We didn’t want to expand into any of the bedrooms, so we agreed that the bathroom would remain really small. We set out to use every inch.</p>
<p class="p6">Making the bathroom functional—versus crammed—meant we had to be intentional with the size of everything. The original bathtub was designed for shorter people, so finding one that could fit my 6’3” husband was a must, and we eventually did. We chose a trim toilet and a vanity that is narrow, but offers storage. We opted for a barn door-style glass shower enclosure to let the light flow through and open up the space.</p>
<p class="p6"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg" alt="Vanity and mirror with bronze hardware" width="1000" height="1501" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p6">Choosing neutral with a pop</h3>
<p class="p6">We also achieved a visual openness with color, or lack of it. We used a lot of bold hues in the rest of our house; we wanted this to be a departure from that, so we went with gray and white. But with this neutral tile choice, we started to <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-splash-a-bath-with-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry that the bathroom would be boring</a>—even if it did feel bigger, and calmer. We added the gold fixtures to give it a luxe feel. The pink paint is a sort of homage to the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">The right renovation team</h3>
<p>Throughout the project, our Sweeten contractor gave honest recommendations and feedback. He was straightforward about what tile and fixtures would work best and be most durable. We received a lot of check-ins from Sweeten as the project progressed; it was helpful to know we had extra support if we needed it.</p>

<p class="p6">We love the result. The super deep soaking tub is amazing and was absolutely worth the money. I love that, unlike with the previous bathroom, I’m not aggravated by the decor when I walk in. Long overdue indeed. We’re so happy we made the most of nearly two tough years and turned this bathroom into a peaceful haven we both love.</p>

			<h2 class="p1">From challenges and solutions to expanding square footage and tips on preparing for the process</h2>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="brown-brick-wall-open-kitchen" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50673" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Philadelphia-Row-House-Remodeling.jpg" alt="brown brick wall in passageway with open kitchen and white kitcben cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="686" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Philadelphia-Row-House-Remodeling.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Philadelphia-Row-House-Remodeling-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Philadelphia-Row-House-Remodeling-600x412.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3">The character of Philadelphia is <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/history-of-american-row-houses-8600298c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined by its rowhouse streetscapes</a>. Rowhouses are space-efficient, compact, and often cost-effective. Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse comes with its share of joys and challenges. Sweeten lays out what you can expect with renovating these historic buildings.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/pa/philadelphia-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">What is a rowhouse in Philadelphia?</h3>
<p class="p3">A Philadelphia rowhouse is an urban one-to-four-story house that has a narrow front exterior. Rowhouses are attached to similar rowhouses on both sides.</p>
<p class="p3">Philadelphia has more rowhouses than any other type of housing structure. Designed as an inexpensive way to house Philadelphia’s rapidly growing industrial population, rowhouses have become desired, premium properties.</p>
<p class="p3">Some Philly rowhouses are quite large. Rittenhouse Square mansions can be as huge as 3,000 to 6,000 square feet. Most Philadelphia rowhouses are small to moderate in size, though. Trinities and Bandboxes (smaller versions of Trinities) can be as tiny as 400 to 600 square feet. Two-story rowhouses in Center City, South and North Philadelphia, and Manayunk can range from 1,000 to 1,600 square feet.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse: Challenges and solutions</h3>
<p class="p3">Because Philly rowhouses are unique, renovating them can present challenges. But to an experienced contractor, solving these issues is just a part of the daily work of creativity and flexibility.</p>
<p class="p3">Philly-area-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6753#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor <span class="s1">John</span></a> calls his approach “bob and weave,” after a boxer’s split-second, nimble approach to punches that come their way. “Rowhouses don’t always need to be more difficult,” said John, “because we try to be flexible.”</p>
<p class="p3">John cites his approach to debris removal as an example. It’s no problem to park rolloff dumpsters in the driveway of a suburban single-family detached house; you just do it. But when a dumpster needs to be parked on a public street, all sorts of permitting issues arise.</p>
<p class="p3">John’s solution is to cycle out debris every day. “A hauling company picks up the daily load and some of my guys have trucks, too, so they can move debris.”</p>
<p class="p3">Narrow doorways are obstacles to moving in building materials and appliances. Sometimes the old 30-inch doorways have been widened already. When they haven’t, John calls this one of his biggest problems with rowhouse remodels. But he can always find workarounds by temporarily removing door trim or by unboxing appliances.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Ways to increase square footage in rowhouses</h3>
<p class="p3">Squeezed in on both sides, the average rowhouse is fairly small. So, remodels need to be creative. Some contractors build soffits (or bulkheads) over exposed pipes, wires, and vents. However, doing this reduces space. “We like to avoid building soffits,” say<span class="s1">s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6510#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Mario</a>, who is based in Philadelphia</span>, “and most homeowners don’t want soffits, either.”</p>
<p class="p3">So, Mario finds it worthwhile to reroute pipes and electrical through walls and ceilings. “It gives it a cleaner look and that’s what people want.” In some cases, Mario will push out a wall or ceiling a smidge. “If the ceiling is 10 feet or more, we might drop the ceiling just a little to run services through there.”</p>
<p class="p3">For homeowners who want more room, there is always more space to be had in the back or upward. “Pilot houses,” says Mario, referring to rooftop decks, “are one of the most popular ways to expand upward.” Plus, he sees some clients purchasing two adjacent rowhouse units and removing the wall between the two. This effectively doubles the rowhouse square footage.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Permitting and approvals for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</h3>
<p class="p3">With most substantial Philadelphia rowhouse remodels, you&#8217;ll need permits. Any alteration that costs $10,000 or more requires drawings of the proposed construction. These drawings must have the seal or stamp of a licensed architect or engineer.</p>
<p class="p3">Sweeten general contractors can refer an architect if the services of one are needed. Having an experienced architect and general contractor by your side will help you move through the permitting process more easily.</p>
<p class="p3">Not every Philly rowhouse is a historically designated structure. However, thousands of them are. If yours is one, you’ll need to seek authorization and go through a separate approval process with the Philadelphia Historic Commission.</p>
<p class="p3">Check the <a href="https://www.phila.gov/documents/philadelphia-register-of-historic-places" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Philadelphia Register of Historic Places</span></a> to see if your home is designated as historic.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>4 tips for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Be ready for costlier materials<br />
</b>Renovating a newer home means that you can use a wide range of materials. Many homeowners can find off-the-shelf materials at the local home center to use. But historic Philly rowhouses have masonry, molding, trim, ornamental metals, walls, and ceilings of a more specialized—and costly—nature. Prepare by padding your materials budget.</li>
<li><b>Be available<br />
</b>Remodeling a Philly rowhouse isn’t a “set it and forget it” project. Be available and responsive to everyone working on your project, including the architect, contractor, or project manager.</li>
<li><b>Predict the unpredictable<br />
</b>Prepare yourself and your budget for contract <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/how-do-i-document-change-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change orders</a> (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon). Change orders help your remodel project adapt to unexpected discoveries along the way.</li>
<li><b>Rely on your experts<br />
</b>Unless your daily job is renovating rowhouses, the experts you’ve hired know more than you do. After all, they do this on a daily basis. You’re not just hiring a pair of hands; you’re taking advantage of years of experience and knowledge.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, we’re taking a look at the rebirth of a trinity townhouse in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. The house, built in the style of a trinity, a slim structure that became popular during a population boom in the early 18th century, caught Nel&#8217;s eye while she was looking to purchase her first home. Two years later, the house was severely damaged by a fire that ravaged the entire street, resulting in a total gut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,200-square-foot home has three stories—plus a basement and roof deck with amazing city views—and had to be rebuilt from the studs up. Nel decided to keep the original floor plans intact—the first-floor dining room and kitchen, second-floor living room plus full bath, and third-floor master bedroom and bath—and bring them back to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her renovation plans in mind</a>, she came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, to restore the house to its former glory and find a new tenant who would love it just as much as she did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp" alt="Trinity house in Philadelphia" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/908_082-1000px.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><b><br />
Sweeten: </b>What motivated you to purchase this trinity house and what led to the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>In 2014 I was looking to purchase my first home, and when I saw this house I absolutely fell in love with it. The house is a 100-year-old trinity located in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. I&#8217;m not sure if you have seen many trinities, but they are a pretty common home type in Philadelphia where the house is three stories tall and each floor is typically a single room. I met Greg shortly thereafter and the two of us lived in the house up until we got engaged in April 2016. We decided to move out because we were thinking about starting a family and wanted to find a home with a second bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was a bit attached to this house and since I work in real estate we decided to try our hand at renting it versus selling it. We found great tenants and everything was going well until the fire last October. The fire destroyed six houses—so basically, the entire block! It was heart-wrenching to watch something I had so many happy memories in be destroyed by fire. But, very fortunately, we have been able to rebuild, which actually has been a funny process because we were able to make some of the upgrades and changes we previously wanted to do when we lived there.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27906 mb-10 size-chrono" title="trinity house floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan-723x896.jpg" alt="trinity house floor plan" width="723" height="896" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Example of a trinity floor plan that&#8217;s similar in size and layout to Nel&#8217;s house</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What made you choose the neighborhood back when you were looking to purchase a home?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>The Bella Vista neighborhood is truly one of my favorites in Philadelphia. We have a 100-year-old Italian bakery at the end of our street and so there is always the wonderful smell of something delicious baking in the air. We are also just around the corner from a park with a bocce court, as well as from the 9th Street Italian Market. I love the neighborhood&#8217;s vibe and all of the small independent businesses and restaurants that are at our front door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What’s your favorite part of the house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>I think one of my favorite parts, aside from the 360-degree views from the roof deck, is the exposed brick wall. It feels like a piece of history which is really neat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What it was like working with your general contractor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>This is actually our second renovation in 12 months, but our first time using Sweeten. I can&#8217;t tell you how wonderful our Sweeten contractor has been. He took a very stressful situation and guided us through it with ease, and we couldn&#8217;t have been happier with how everything has turned out. Greg and I have actually joked about moving back in!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>Now that the house is finished, what are your plans for it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>We are going to keep it as a rental for now and who knows&#8230;maybe someday we will live there again!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Now let’s check in with the Sweeten general contractor responsible for this townhouse’s transformation.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What were the challenges you faced while renovating this trinity house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor:</b> It was the amount of work that needed to take place in the small footprint of the house. We needed to add new code-compliant systems to a home that was designed to have a small footprint over 100 years ago! Several homes on the same block that were also damaged in the fire were under construction at the same time, so parking was limited. Material deliveries on the small street were very tough, if not impossible. All of the materials for the roof deck and drywall needed to be loaded in by hand. Also, work on the roof deck was held up due to permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What was the damage done by the fire?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>The entire home was flooded by the water used to extinguish the rooftop fire. The house was dried out and all damaged organic materials were removed prior to us being hired by a restoration company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What major work did you and your team tackle during the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>We installed all new electric, some plumbing, a new high-efficiency HVAC, insulation, drywall, and new finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> Did you encounter any delays during the process?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Yes, the roof deck had to be designed by a licensed architect—we couldn&#8217;t replace what was there under the permit for the interior. The drawings for the roof deck also needed to be completed and reviewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> The results are simply stunning—all of your hard work has definitely paid off!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Overall, it was a great project, Nel was a wonderful client and we couldn&#8217;t have done it without Sweeten making the match. We are very proud of the work we did here and how the home turned out.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Nel and her Sweeten general contractor for sharing their story, both the good and the bad, and giving us a look inside this reborn trinity!</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Gina, a product director, and Dan, who works in account and finance, moved into his childhood home in Media, Pennsylvania, after relocating for a new job and learning they were going to start a family (their son Jack is now 2 years old). Dan’s parents were planning to retire and head south, so the couple rented their 1950s traditional brick, split-level home for a few years. It gave them time to think about the work they’d complete if they decided to make it their own. When they did buy it, the first-time homeowners had a renovation vision underway for the old-fashioned kitchen. The layout wasn’t ideal for entertaining or cooking, and they wanted to increase the square footage, too. “We wanted a bright, open kitchen that was traditional but with clean, modern touches,” Gina shared. The duo <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their Media kitchen renovation project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

Instead of having a traditional table and chairs, we wanted to have stools all around the table where people could casually gather,” Gina said. Plus, they still have a separate dining area on the lower level of the home in what was once a living room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take advantage of their much larger kitchen, the renovators decided against installing upper cabinetry. Ceiling-height cabinets surrounding the two-door refrigerator and island drawers offer more than enough storage.</span></p>

Sweeten matched Gina and Dan with a general contractor they felt comfortable with and worked hand-in-hand with them to first come up with a plan and then execute it. As a former project manager, Gina especially appreciated the contractor’s detailed timelines that laid out when each renovation step would occur. “They set up times for each task and ended up wrapping things up earlier than expected. They took whatever extra time they had and tried to get other things done based on the project, which really helped keep everything on track,” she shared.</span></p>

I think it’s very rare anyone ever has that reaction to a kitchen renovation,” Gina said.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Their contractor also replaced a window over the kitchen sink to match the other white framed ones.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refinish a basement in Ardmore, Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When David and Wendy bought their 2,700-square-foot home in a Philadelphia suburb, one thing was for sure: the smelly, dated basement had to go. David completely demoed it with every intention of refinishing it after they moved in. Two years later and the basement had become a storage room instead of the recreational space for “serious TV watching,” an exercise area, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/">bar</a> that he’d hoped to create. &#8220;I never got around to it, though, and finally hired someone through Sweeten,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35324 noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35324 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan-723x933.jpg" alt="floor plan, basement renovation, home renovation, design, basement renovation before and after" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan-232x300.jpg 232w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan-600x774.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Ready to take on the unfinished basement once and for all, David <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> on Sweeten and chose this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Since he’d already completed the demolition, they hit the ground running and kept his main goal of having a &#8220;dedicated space for TV-watching where [he] didn&#8217;t have to worry about large speakers ruining the decor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they had to determine how to best lay out the basement to meet his multi-purpose needs. A cousin who owns the interior design firm <a href="https://lkdesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LK Design</a> helped David figure out where to position the bar, fitness equipment, and the entertainment seating. Coming down the stairs from the main floor, the exercise area was set up directly to the right and away from the main living space. The bar and mini kitchen open conveniently to the seating area for easy access. Low ductwork presented a great spot to place the cabinetry and sink, and to maximize headspace as much as possible, they placed the bar directly under an exposed steel beam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for finishing touches, they outfitted the theater with plush carpeting for optimal comfort. For the remainder of the flooring, David decided on more durable (plus pet- and kid-friendly!) vinyl plank. The kitchen and bar got a luxe touch with granite <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>, gray cabinets, and chrome hardware.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35322 noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35316 noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-area-granite-countertop" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48564 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg" alt="Kitchen area with sink under grantite countertop and gray cabinetry after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Overall the biggest challenge (aside from determining the layout) was getting the bar sink installed below the sewer line. Fortunately, a plumber found a solution and installed a pump. Their Sweeten general contractor also provided invaluable assistance getting a full-size refrigerator down the narrow staircase, not to mention handling a few issues with vendors and navigating delays. &#8220;We had gas lines in the way of the ceiling, and he had a plumber who was able to reroute the lines in a very cost-effective way. Previous plumbers I had found only suggested much more expensive solutions,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thinking ahead, they also prepared for possible wiring needs down the line and “future-proofed” throughout the basement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does the family feel about their new hangout space? &#8220;Comfortable and relaxed,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="low-white-ceiling-blue-walls" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48569 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Low white ceiling with blue walls in the entertainment room and fitness equipment after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: David and the contractor installed built-in cabinets in the corners of the entertaining area to hide the gas meters.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Carpeting: <a href="https://www.mohawkflooring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohawk</a>. Lifeproof vinyl plank flooring: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Cabinets, cabinet fronts, faucet: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikea</a>.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristiana and her husband</a> took advantage of valuable square footage and turned their basement into a multi-purpose space complete with a family room, wine storage, and laundry area.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a builder-grade kitchen in Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The birth of the couple&#8217;s first child came two weeks after purchasing a two-story rowhouse in Philadelphia’s Graduate Hospital neighborhood. The baby’s arrival meant that plans to renovate the builder-grade kitchen would have to be put on hold. Fast forward two years later, with another baby on the way, this growing family decided to squeeze in the much-needed renovation before the due date. The kitchen was in dire need of a change: remodeled in 2004, it had generic faux wood cabinets, inefficient appliances, limited storage, and a lack of natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34743 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01-723x722.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia" width="723" height="722" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: As a couple who loves to cook and dine in their eat-in kitchen, the homeowners wanted to make it brighter and more efficient. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten were matched with a general contractor. “[The kitchen] gets a LOT of use as the main backdrop for our lives,” the homeowner explained. The biggest change on the list of must-haves was the relocation of the exterior door to another wall in order to make room for a seating nook. To boost the flow of sunlight, a new window was planned for the spot where the old door originally stood. Inspired by the homeowner’s experience working in museums, the new kitchen, with flat-front all-white cabinets, unobtrusive hardware, and few distractions on the countertops, would feel similar to the clean backdrop of an empty gallery space; bright and full of potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34752 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08-723x1012.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertops, white cabinets, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="1012" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The white quartz <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a> and backsplash create a clean backdrop while the emerald green <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile </a>adds plenty of character. Most of the improvements in the kitchen—a trash can tucked behind a cabinet door and drawers beneath the sink—felt like the missing pieces of the puzzle. New <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appliances</a>, including a smaller refrigerator taking up less space and a range hood that vents outside instead of recirculating air inside, are all energy-efficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34746 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, white cabinets, seating nook" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34747 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, seating nook, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The first-time renovators discovered you may not know what you&#8217;ll find behind the walls in your home. In the process of moving the entrance, their Sweeten contractor opened up the walls and uncovered missing overhead support beams, structurally unsound vertical supports, mysterious gaps of empty space, and interior-grade drywall behind the exterior siding instead of plywood. He patiently and quickly worked to solve the serious problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34755 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, range hood, white quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34749 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, range hood, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing the issues behind the walls extended the timeline from 2-3 months to 6 months. The baby was born in the middle of it all, but now that work is done, the family has peace of mind knowing their home is structurally sound. “We love our new kitchen,” the homeowner tells us, “We realize that while it might be too monochrome for some, it&#8217;s exactly what we wanted.”</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia. Similar programs exist in many other cities such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/community-development/housing-assistance/residential-property-tax-abatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>
<table style="height: 349px;" width="797">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Read up on licensed general contractors in Philly, the EZ Permit system, and historical landmarks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49252 mb-24 size-full" title="Philadelphia historic homes" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled.jpg" alt="philadelphia rowhouse remodel" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" />(<em>Above</em>) &#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kingston Ko for Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/trinity-home-renovation-philadelphia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nel&#8217;s rowhouse</a> in Bella Vista</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No two cities are exactly the same when it comes to renovating, and this absolutely the case for Philadelphia. As one of the oldest municipalities in the U.S., Philadelphia&#8217;s individuality can be seen in its broad mix of housing types. According to Sweeten founder and CEO, Jean Brownhill: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Philadelphia has a unique architectural mix, from historic rowhouses and trinities to modern condos.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>However, with a unique housing supply comes a unique set of rules and regulations. Philly homeowners considering remodeling should be aware of these before starting a project. In this guide, Sweeten outlines what to know about renovating in this historic city: upsides, challenges, and remodeling tips specific to the region.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">In Philadelphia, a licensed general contractor can file your permits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike New York, where an engineer or architect must file building permits, a licensed general contractor can do the job in Philly. If a contractor files the permit, actually the most likely scenario here, the contractor will need a commercial activity license and a contractor&#8217;s license from the City of Philadelphia. A contractor license requires a certificate of insurance, at least one supervising employee to have completed OSHA 30 training and a tax clearance form, which proves the contractor filing the building permit application does not owe the city any money. (If they are in debt to the city—i.e. with taxes—the application will be rejected.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a contractor is doing more than $500 worth of work for you, they will need a contractor’s license. Why is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor with </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the wise choice? (Well, the easy answer is: it would be illegal not to have one!) But it’s also for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your project, as it ensures the contractor <a href="https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-licenses-and-inspections/permits-and-certificates/contractor-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knows how to run a safe worksite</a> and has adequate insurance.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-point screening process</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sweeten makes sure any contractor in its network not only has a license, but also has experience with your type of project and budget parameters, and is local.

<h3>Smaller Philadelphia remodeling jobs may qualify for EZ Permits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other cities might require building plans for even the smallest jobs, Philly doesn’t. The city’s </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/services/permits-violations-licenses/apply-for-a-permit/building-and-repair/get-permits-without-plans-ez-permits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EZ Permits </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">system allows some building, electrical, and plumbing permit applications involving single-family homes to be submitted without plans. Projects that get the EZ Permits go-ahead include installing flooring, replacing roof coverings, putting in certain pools and spas, or adding a rear deck that is less than 216 square feet. (Take note: any buildings on the <a href="https://www.phila.gov/departments/philadelphia-historical-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philadelphia Historical Registry</a> will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> qualify for EZ Permits, regardless of the project’s scope.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your project does not fall under EZ Permits, and the budget exceeds $25,000, three sets of building plans must be submitted—all signed and sealed by a design professional registered in the state of Pennsylvania. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Structural Design Criteria </span><a href="https://business.phila.gov/media/structural_design_criteria.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also required if your renovations are substantial, such as moving a load-bearing wall and reframing windows and doors.</span></p>
<h3>Are you renovating a landmark or in a historic district in Philadelphia?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you purchased a landmarked home in need of TLC, the city’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical Commission</span> has strict regulations to follow. Y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou most likely already know if your home is a landmark or in a historic district. But if you want to double-check, </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/historical/register/Pages/RegisterofHistoricPlaces.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here&#8217;s a list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Are you altering the outside of your home (the roof, back, sides, and/or front)? In that case, your historic home project will need the blessing of the commission. This is different from other cities, where only renovations on the street-facing facade of a historic building are subject to additional approvals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your project involves a historic home in Philly, then a general contractor, engineer, or architect who has some experience working with the Historic Commission will be very helpful. (This will come in handy, as they will likely be filing the paperwork!)</span></p>
<h3>Tips for renovating Philadelphia&#8217;s rowhouses</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pride of the city&#8217;s real estate is its rowhouses. The side-by-side homes are more numerous than any other building type in the city. Many are now multi-family housing units. One common type of rowhouse is the three-story trinity, (tiny, three-story homes built for factory workers in the 1700s). You&#8217;ll also see larger, Victorian-style rowhouse structures, which were historically occupied by more affluent locals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowhouses are so important to Philadelphia&#8217;s identity that the city actually created a </span><a href="https://urbanrowhouse.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/the-philadelphia-rowhouse-manual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manual for those who own them! </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manual outlines why they are significant and how to renovate them. For example, it encourages rowhouse owners to consider the impact of facade renovations on the look of their neighborhood. (This even applies if the building isn’t a landmark or in a historic district.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manual shares a few more rowhouse-specific renovation tips. For example, it recommends using a modified asphalt—a specific type of material—for the gently sloping roofs, which most rowhouses have. The manual also covers serious construction changes, like adding a garage under the home. (Another upside: there’s plenty of general renovation advice in the manual that can relate to non-rowhouse owners!)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Should you take on a staircase remodel or build new stairs in your Philadelphia-area home?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28.jpg" alt="Blue closed coat closet with pink staircase and green coat hangers" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50810" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Evaluating your stair needs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your remodel involves a staircase from a 1780 Philadelphia trinity, a colonial rowhouse, or a suburban home from the 1980s, chances are the staircase you currently have won’t meet today’s building codes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that building around and refurbishing what you have may well be the most efficient on the budget, design, and logistics of your project. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, safety and modernization may require the creation of a new set of stairs. </span>Read about codes, structural work, permits, and refurbishing vs. new builds for a staircase remodel in Philadephia with advice from <a href="https://sweeten.com/pa/philadelphia-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local Sweeten general contractors</a>.</p>
<h3><b>What do building codes say about new staircases?</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, the older the building is, the steeper the staircase will be. Staircases built before the 1950s often have a tread of about nine inches with a nine-inch rise. As a result, the vertical and horizontal pieces are evenly sized. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/li/codesandregulations/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Code Council</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(used by the City of Philadelphia and many surrounding municipalities) now calls for more tread and less height: requiring a 10.5-inch tread with a maximum rise of 7.75 inches. The code also requires a minimum width of 36 inches, expanding older conventions where a staircase might be as slim as 26 inches. The trick here is that old construction is grandfathered in and doesn’t run afoul of the code, unless you decide to replace what’s there.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1">Winder stairs code</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staircases that wind around corners can also be problematic. In its </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20190521124726/Philadelphia_Rowhouse_Manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical guide to rowhouses</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the City’s planning commission refers to these as “winders,” where stairs spiral out from a single point. Because of poor safety—walking down is difficult—adding “winders” is now illegal in major renovations and new construction. So, you can keep any existing, older winder staircases; but replacing them brings new requirements that might be challenging to fit in the house’s dimensions. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>How a new staircase can affect your floor plan</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to replace a staircase, you must meet current codes. In older homes, this causes problems. As the code calls for a longer tread and a lower rise, a new staircase typically needs to be longer to reach between floors, and will overshoot the current length. In homes with a small footprint, new staircase dimensions can end up awkwardly jutting out against a wall or door. In some cases, you can add a slight turn to the new staircase design to minimize length. Additionally, you may be able to elevate some of the overhead floor to accommodate the additional length, but in many cases, refurbishing what you have will be the least invasive solution.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Structural work and permits needed for a new staircase build</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constructing a new staircase requires building permits and your plans will also need the approval of a structural engineer or a registered architect. Prepare yourself for electrical and plumbing implications (and permits) if your designs involve layout or structural changes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many older staircases are typically walled-in on one or both sides. With current housing trends calling for an open plan, most homeowners want to open up at least one side of a staircase, either partially or in full. These walls on the side of the stairs are usually always load-bearing and therefore structural. Building <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/renovating-philadelphia-heres-need-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permits and approvals in Philadelphia</a> by either a structural engineer or a registered architect will be required.</span></p>
<h4>Reasons to build a new staircase</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety and accessibility are the biggest reasons to bring in a new staircase. Consider treads that cannot fit a whole foot, steep rises between stairs, a winding path, and a slim fit between wall and railing. These aspects aren’t easy to navigate and can affect use for people of all ages.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>How to renovate an existing staircase</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Updating the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/trinity-home-renovation-philadelphia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aesthetics of an existing staircase</a> will be less invasive and probably won’t need building permits. There are ways to refurbish a staircase without changing the structure. “Replace the treads, risers, or railing” if you’re looking for an update, advises Philadelphia-based <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Kenny. “If you keep the existing opening through the floor above, you’ll avoid the requirement for a code-compliant stair, which might not fit in your home.” You can also update the stringers (which support the treads) by adding material to strengthen or enhance them, he continued.</p>
<p class="p1">Other changes to consider include adding or removing carpeting; updating the banister style; changing the wood type over the staircase’s substructure; or laying down tile.</p>
<h3>Finding the right general contractor in Philadelphia for a staircase remodel</h3>
<p><span class="s1">It&#8217;s clear that remodeling a staircase in a home, especially a historic or older home, can be challenging. For example, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philly rowhouses vary in size but are typically small to moderately-sized with Trinities and Bandboxes coming in at 400 to 600 square feet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovating a Philadelphia rowhouse</a> requires experienced contractors who understand the rules and codes for working in these types of structures. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post your project</a> and we&#8217;ll connect you with the right contractors.</span> </span></p>
