However, it’s not a totally straightforward calculation, because what matters most isn’t the footprint, it’s the fixtures and finishes that will fill that space — more plumbing fixtures, in the form of sinks, showers, toilets, etc., means greater costs.

				<h3><b>Finish level: How bathroom design affects remodeling costs in </b>Chicago</h3><p>Finish level refers to the general quality and price level of fixtures, materials, and finishes. These include wall treatments, vanity materials and fabrication, flooring choices, and the brands and models of sinks, faucets, and fixtures you choose. The higher the finish level, the faster your costs will increase. </p><ul><li><span><b>Budget finish: </b></span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/">Budget bathroom materials</a> are generally off-the-shelf items from “big box” stores or IKEA. This includes stock vanities; <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/chicago-condo-remodel-of-a-fixer-upper-new-home/">various tiles under $5/square foot</a> such as Pergo and Daltile; and fixtures by Delta, Moen, and Pfister.</li><li><span><b>Mid-grade finish: </b></span>Mid-grade materials balance cost efficiency with material quality. This includes vanities by Design House, Fresca, and Signature Hardware; tile by TileBar; and fixtures by American Standard, Hansgrohe, and Kohler.</li><li><span><b>High-end finish: </b></span>High-end materials take quality and craftsmanship above standard, and this category introduces custom work. This includes tiles by Clé Tile, Ann Sacks, and Artistic Tile; vanities by Duravit, Robern, and DXV; and fixtures by Kallista and Brizo.</li><li><span><b>Luxury finish: </b></span>Luxury means the sky’s the limit, where customization, craftsmanship and materials truly go above and beyond.

This is the more straightforward way to reimagine your space, and can often be done with just a licensed general contractor partner. </p><h4><span><b>Gut renovation</b></span></h4><p>For a gut renovation, you’ll be dropping walls, rerouting plumbing lines and rewiring electrical — generally stripping the room to the studs and subfloor (or, even removing these!) in order to change up the layout of the space. This kind of transformational project will require professional design and architectural services,  permitting, and licensed general contractors, which ensures the work is done safely and to code. </p>					</div>

				<p><span>The two main services to consider for your bathroom renovation are build service and design service. Depending on your needs, you have some options for what types of firms to hire.  </span></p><h4><span><b>Build service with a general contractor </b></span></h4><p>Build service would include demolition and construction services, and would be carried out by <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your general contractor</a>. Some general contractors are considered build-only firms, which means that they do not offer full professional design. Even within the build-only category, there are a range of different service offerings a contractor might provide — some will strictly work with finished plans from a professional designer, some will work with you to carry out the vision you conceive, and others are more willing to offer creative suggestions and advice on material and fixture choices, or even rough visualizations for spatial layout. </p><p>A combination of service level, experience, and things like firm size and overhead might all contribute to how competitive a contractor’s pricing is. We generally recommend to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect with a few different contractors</a> to feel out what level of service best suits you. </p><h4><span><b>Design service with an architect or interior designer</b></span></h4><p>Design service can be broken down into creative design and technical design. For creative design service, which is almost always optional, you’ll work with an architect or interior designer to reimagine the space. This added layer of service will generally cost between 10-20% of your construction budget, depending on the level of service included in your design package (though, not all firms determine their fees based on cost of construction — some may charge a flat fee based on project scope and anticipated duration, for example). So, for a $40,000 bathroom renovation, you might expect to pay your architect or designer $4,000 to $8,000. </p><p>Technical design expertise is needed in the form of an architect (or sometimes structural engineer) for projects like gut renovations where permitting is required. Their main role is to ensure that the project is done safely and to code. </p><h4><span><b>What is a full-service, design-build firm? </b></span></h4><p>If you need both design and build services, you can choose to hire a professional designer or architect, and separately, a general contractor. But there’s another option that comes with some distinct benefits: you can hire a design-build firm — a general contractor with dedicated professional design under one roof. This means you work with the same firm from planning and design through construction. In addition to the continuity, which can often save time in the process, some clients appreciate that the working relationship means more seamless coordination, which can even help to keep your project on budget. </p>					</div>

For an average, full bath, a full, rip-and-replace bathroom remodel in Chicago will range from $16,500 to $69,000 and up, depending on finishes. This estimate includes all materials, labor, overhead, and a standard general contractor margin. <br /><br /></p><p></p><p>A major gut bathroom remodel would add an additional 15-25% to the total cost of materials and labor for the same square footage.

Standard ceramic tile can start at just $1.50 per square foot while marble tile is closer to $50 per square foot. Add a standard overage amount of at least 10% of raw material.

					<div id="elementor-tab-content-1118" class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="8" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elementor-tab-title-1118"><p>The bulk of your bathroom remodeling costs will be tied to the total number of fixtures, and the quality of the fixtures and materials you choose. A small full bathroom with 3-4 fixtures and a large full bathroom with 3-4 fixtures, might cost close to the same because the only difference will be in square footage of flooring and wall treatments. On the other hand, a half bathroom with only 2 fixtures, a sink and toilet, will cost considerably less than a full bath renovation with 3-4 fixtures.  <br /><br /></p><p>In Chicago, the cost for a typical half bathroom remodel can range from $6,500-$25,000 and up; whereas the cost for a full, rip-and-replace remodel of a small full bathroom can range from $16,500-$69,000 and up, depending on finish level of the materials used. A major gut renovation for a bathroom of the same size would add an additional 15-25% to the total cost of materials and labor. </p><div></div></div>

					<div id="elementor-tab-content-1119" class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="9" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elementor-tab-title-1119"><p>Your general contractor can give you an idea of possible issues that may arise during a bathroom remodel in Chicago, based on the age and type of home they’re working on. However, a contractor cannot price out every possible problem, as things can arise after walls are broken into. They may discover an issue with your plumbing or electrical, for example.<br /> </p><p></p><p>Major projects often involve permitting fees, and change orders after a contract has been signed can also add to the overall cost. To protect yourself from unseen costs, set aside a 10-15% contingency budget for a non-gut renovation. If you are planning a gut remodel, set aside 15-20% for issues that come up along the way. Having a monetary cushion will keep your remodeling project on track. </p></div>

				<p class="p1">This may sound obvious, but the larger your bathroom, generally the more expensive your renovation project will be. However, it’s not a totally straightforward calculation, because what matters most isn’t the footprint, it’s the fixtures and finishes that will fill that space — more plumbing fixtures, in the form of sinks, showers, toilets, etc., means greater costs. Here’s how you can think about sizing up your <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/">bathroom remodeling projects</a>:</p>					</div>

				<h3><b>Finish level: How bathroom design affects remodeling costs</b></h3><p>Finish level refers to the general quality and price level of fixtures, materials, and finishes.

The higher the finish level, the faster your costs will increase. </p><ul><li><span><b>Budget finish: </b></span>Budget materials are generally off-the-shelf items from “big box” stores or IKEA. This includes <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ikea-bath-vanity/">stock vanities</a>; various tiles under $5/square foot such as Pergo and Daltile; and fixtures by Delta, Moen, and Pfister.</li><li><span><b>Mid-grade finish: </b></span>Mid-grade materials balance cost efficiency with material quality. This includes vanities by Design House, Fresca, and Signature Hardware; tile by TileBar; and fixtures by American Standard, Hansgrohe, and Kohler.</li><li><span><b>High-end finish: </b></span>High-end materials take quality and craftsmanship <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/">above standard</a>, and this category introduces custom work. This includes tiles by Clé Tile, Ann Sacks, and Artistic Tile; vanities by Duravit, Robern, and DXV; and fixtures by Kallista and Brizo.</li><li><span><b>Luxury finish: </b></span>Luxury means the sky’s the limit, where customization, craftsmanship and materials truly go above and beyond.

				<p>Project scope refers to the amount and type of work that needs to be done, and can have implications on which <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">professionals you’ll need to hire</a>. We divide scope into the following broad categories (when a contractor prepares an estimate for your renovation, it will be much more detailed, and will include costs of the exact fixtures and finishes):</p><h4><span><b>Full renovation (also called “rip-and-replace”)</b>  </span></h4><p>A full renovation means that you’re replacing all old fixtures and finishes with new ones, while leaving everything in place. So, effectively, the layout is the same before and after the renovation (hence, the nickname “rip-and-replace”). This is the more straightforward way to reimagine your space, and can often be done with only your <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/">locally-qualified general contractors</a>. </p><h4><span><b>Gut renovation</b></span></h4><p>For a gut renovation, you’ll be dropping walls, rerouting plumbing lines and rewiring electrical — generally stripping the room to the studs and subfloor (or, even removing these!) in order to change up the layout of the space. This kind of transformational project will require professional design or architectural services, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/do-you-need-permits-to-remodel-a-bathroom/">permitting</a>, and locally-qualified general contractors, which ensures the work is done safely and to code. If you&#8217;re planning on <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-convert-bathtub-into-a-shower/">converting your bathtub to a shower</a>, these rules apply. </p>					</div>

				<p>The two main services to consider for your bathroom renovation are build service and design service. Depending on your needs, you have some options for what <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">types of firms to hire</a>.  </p><h4><span><b>Build service with a general contractor </b></span></h4><p>Build service would include demolition and construction services, and would be carried out by your general contractor. Some general contractors are considered build-only firms, which means that they do not offer full professional design. Even within the build-only category, there are a range of different service offerings a contractor might provide — some will strictly work with finished plans from a professional designer, some will work with you to carry out the vision you conceive, and others are more willing to offer creative suggestions and advice on material and fixture choices, or even rough visualizations for spatial layout. </p><p>A combination of service level, experience, and things like firm size and overhead might all contribute to how competitive a contractor’s pricing is. We generally recommend to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect with a few different contractors</a> to feel out what level of service best suits you. </p><h4><span><b>Design service with an architect or interior designer</b></span></h4><p>Design service can be broken down into creative design and technical design. For creative design service, which is almost always optional, you’ll work with an architect or interior designer to reimagine the space. This added layer of service will generally cost between 10-20% of your construction budget, depending on the level of service included in your design package (though, not all firms determine their fees based on cost of construction — some may charge a flat fee based on project scope and anticipated duration, for example). So, for a $40,000 bathroom renovation, you might expect to pay your architect or designer $4,000 to $8,000. </p><p>Technical design expertise is needed in the form of an architect (or sometimes structural engineer) for projects like gut renovations where permitting is required. Their main role is to ensure that the project is done safely and to code. </p><h4><span><b>What is a full-service, design-build firm? </b></span></h4><p>If you need both design and build services, you can choose to hire a professional designer or architect, and separately, a general contractor. But there’s another option that comes with some distinct benefits: you can hire a design-build firm — a general contractor with dedicated professional design under one roof. This means you work with the same firm from planning and design through construction. In addition to the continuity, which can often save time in the process, some clients appreciate that the working relationship means more seamless coordination, which can even help to keep your project on budget. </p>					</div>

According to national averages, for a typical, full bath, a full rip-and-replace bathroom remodel will range from $16,000 to $56,500 and up, depending on finishes. This estimate includes all materials, labor, overhead, and a standard general contractor margin. <br /><br /></p><p></p><p>A major gut bathroom remodel would add an additional 15-25% to the total cost of materials and labor for the same square footage.</p><div></div></div>

They may discover an issue with your plumbing or electrical, for example.<br /> </p><p></p><p>Major projects often involve permitting fees, and change orders after a contract has been signed can also add to the overall cost. To protect yourself from unseen costs, set aside a 10-15% contingency budget for a non-gut renovation. If you are planning a gut remodel, set aside 15-20% for issues that come up along the way.

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Dallas </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Dallas is the ninth-largest city in the United States. It’s the headquarters for multiple Fortune 500 companies like American Airlines. There’s the Dallas Cowboys (as well as real cowboys!) And of course, there’s BBQ. Dallas is a thriving city and a great place to renovate your dream home. <span class="s2">Sweeten</span>&#8216;s guide to 2021 Dallas remodeling costs</span><span class="s3"> provides a jumping-off point to get you on your way with estimates from Sweeten and the <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">2021 Cost vs Value Report</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Developing a budget is your first step to your dream Dallas home. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Gut renovation: starting at <strong>$80—$100</strong> per square foot (psf)</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Budget kitchen remodel: starting at &#8211; <strong>$15,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$25,000—$30,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Budget bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$8,000—$15,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$15,000—$25,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$30,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Deck composite: <strong>$19,000</strong> or <strong>$60</strong> psf</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Wood deck: <strong>$13,000</strong> or <strong>$40</strong> psf</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s7"><b>“</b></span><span class="s1">With the lockdowns from covid, we saw companies cut production and manpower with the expectation that construction would slow down (which it did not),” </span><span class="s8">Dallas-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6958#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">Sweeten contractor Joel</span></a></span><span class="s7"> said,</span><span class="s1"> “and it took awhile to ramp up production.” With a large influx of people moving out of the coastal cities and into the South and Midwest, “there’s been an increase in housing demand making quality labor more expensive.” </span><span class="s7">Overall, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6896#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s10">Sweeten contractor Kyle</span></a>, who is also based in Dallas, <b>“</b></span><span class="s11">Costs are going up in today&#8217;s current environment for: the whole home, the kitchen, and the bathroom.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">Dallas home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Dallas that brings your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking, starts at <strong>$80—$100</strong> psf. For a home that has budget finishes, this means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You&#8217;ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">As a guide, </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1"> advises clients to tie the price of their kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of their home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value “to really cap the budget at the return on investment,” </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1"> said. So for a <strong>$300,000</strong> home, aim to spend between <strong>$30,000</strong> and <strong>$60,000</strong> on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Before getting started, general <span class="s2">contractor Kyle</span> suggests homeowners research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don’t end up with a budget-level renovation in a high-end area or vice versa. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2021</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s13"></span><span class="s14">A kitchen renovation i</span><span class="s5">n the budget range can start at <strong>$10,000</strong> and reach <strong>$15,000</strong>. This would apply to a 75-100-square-foot room. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s5">. To keep costs down, cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next upgrade is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.</span></li>
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">A mid-grade kitchen remodel in Dallas at the same square footage has costs starting at <strong>$25,000—$30,000</strong>. What does a mid-grade kitchen look like at this starting cost? The kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for a new one and your old sink for a new sink. You can get a stainless steel sink with a single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p12"><span class="s5">“A kitchen with upgraded material and selections, as well as special additions such pot fillers, custom-built islands, under cabinet lighting, etc. can drive up the cost to <strong>$50,000</strong> and higher,” says Sweeten contractor Kyle.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">For an upscale kitchen that is 75-100 square feet, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000</strong>.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from <strong>$50,000</strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were custom-made cabinets as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. “Adding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen” also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">There are plenty of variables in most materials, according to Sweeten contractor </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1">. For example, with quartz you can spend <strong>$2,000</strong> or <strong>$7,000</strong> depending upon the quality. “It just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,” </span><span class="s12">Joel </span><span class="s1">advised.</span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2021</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">At the budget level, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at <strong>$8,000—$15,000</strong>. These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms at 35 square feet. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn’t move, Kyle said. This budget won’t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">In the Dallas area, a 35-square-foot mid-grade bathroom can start at <strong>$15,000—$25,000</strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about <strong>$22,866</strong> or <strong>$653</strong> psf with the same dimensions, according to the 2021 Cost vs Value Report. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. More than 55 percent of your budget </span><span class="s3">can be recouped in the value the project adds to your home.  </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5’ x 7’ space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Cost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,” said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.</span></p>
<h3 class="p13"><span class="s1">2021 costs to adding outdoor space to a Dallas-area home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it’s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a hot summer evening. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It’s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic wooden deck will likely cost <strong>$49</strong> psf or <strong>$15,678</strong> for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under <strong>$20,857</strong> for the same size or <strong>$65</strong> psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance. </span></p>
<h3 class="p13"><span class="s1">2021 Dallas remodeling costs: Permits</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upmarket suburb of <a href="https://www.hptx.org/179/Fees"><span class="s2">Highland Park</span></a> bases building permit costs on square footage. The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs <strong>$490</strong>, according to Highland Park’s calculator.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the city of Addison,<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://addisontexas.net/sites/default/files/fileattachments/development_services/page/10881/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf"><span class="s2">building permit fees</span></a> for a project with a budget between <strong>$2,000</strong> and <strong>$25,000</strong> will have a base cost of <strong>$115</strong> with an additional <strong>$23</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> for estimated costs over <strong>$2,000</strong>. That means the permit for a <strong>$20,000</strong> mid-grade bathroom remodel will cost <strong>$529</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees in <span class="s2">Cedar Hill</span>, southwest of the city’s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of <strong>$400</strong> for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by <strong>$.60</strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by <strong>$.40</strong>.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Demolition, amount of work, a home&#8217;s condition, and alternate living arrangements all affect gut home renovation costs</span></h2>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A different level of owner commitment comes with a gut home renovation than a smaller renovation project. Here, Sweeten provides some guidance on points to consider when planning a major project like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What’s involved in a gut home renovation?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, let’s define the term. Gutting a home is more than an extensive remodel. It’s taking the walls down to the studs, removing existing interior doors and trim, cabinets, sinks, and exposing the structure of the home. It often includes replacing windows and exterior doors, the roof, and replacing most or all plumbing and electrical. Gutting is about the material removal before you remodel.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A renovation budget overview</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Costs of materials</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ll find Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation cost guides</a> here but keep in mind material costs and timelines have shifted. Prices for materials and labor have jumped, drastically in some cases and in some locales. It’s a good idea to add 20% to the materials budget and talk with your contractor about timing, materials, and budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Do not wait. Many sectors are experiencing a backlog in the supply of materials. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices may continue to go up and your material order will be at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">“Must-haves” and “Nice-to-haves” lists</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When making your project budget, it’s important to create a renovation list of “must-haves.” These are elements that are definitely required for the project, then make a second wishlist of “nice-to-haves.” This includes all of the changes you’d like to see but might be willing to forgo as you consider your budget. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A home’s existing condition</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s also crucial to be realistic about the condition of your home, as the cost of a gut renovation can vary considerably by the condition of the structure. Updating the mechanical systems such as the electrical panel and old plumbing can range from straightforward in a dated foursquare house to challenging in a home located in an historic district.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ask your contractor about worst-case scenarios given the building’s age and history. Consider the budget contingency that will give you peace of mind when your project kicks off. Your contractor can’t price out every possible surprise, but you should feel confident that you have a partner who will help you problem-solve when challenges come up.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Have a contingency plan</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners undertaking serious gut remodels should build in an extra cash reserve for issues that come up along the way including issues that come up once the walls are broken into. Add more than 15% for a gut remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathrooms contain the most plumbing and fixtures per square foot so tend to be the most expensive spaces in the house per square foot. Kitchens are next, then the other living spaces follow.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Should you leave or stay during a gut home renovation?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most important considerations is <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deciding where you’ll live during the project</a>. Nearly anything is possible, so you probably <i>can</i> remain in the house during the project. However, nearly any other plan is preferable for most people because you’ll almost certainly have to deal with surprises. You might discover a need for structural reinforcement, or unveil mold or asbestos, and decide then that you should reside elsewhere for a while. Also, if you do choose to stay during the project, you’ll need to make sure that you’re legally allowed to do so, too. Your city’s building department is the place to inquire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just remember that if you decide to stay in the home during the project to save money, you’ll still incur costs, and they could be substantial. Financial costs include delaying the project because you or your things are in the way. Non-financial costs could include a strain on daily family routines such as finding alternatives for when a kitchen or shower is being renovated. All those can result in financial costs, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your contractor will guide you through the cost for permits and regulations associated with your project, such as placing dumpsters. If your home is in a homeowner’s association, they will also have requirements to meet.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Demolition before renovation</span></h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">The demolition part of gutting a home is mostly labor and disposal costs, so it’s not really that expensive but removing plumbing pipes and drains and so on takes time. O</span><span class="s5">utsourcing the demo or doing it as a DIY project doesn’t really save much money. For safety and hazard concerns, Sweeten recommends leaving demolition to the professionals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note that moving walls is not included in these costs. Moving load-bearing walls requires consulting with a structural engineer, and that could be $500—$1,000. Whenever you change walls around you’ll need to build temporary support walls, so there’s another cost to add in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During demolition, you may discover hazards like asbestos, lead paint, and mold. If you do, a pro will evaluate how extensive the problem is. These hazards are not DIY-friendly. In some places, you’re not legally permitted to deal with these dangerous materials, especially asbestos which can only be handled by a professional.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The general contractor brings subcontractor connections</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, managing an extensive construction project like gutting a home is challenging and benefits from having an experienced general contractor. A general contractor usually has steady and long-standing connections to many subcontractors, so communication often goes smoothly. They will orchestrate and schedule between architects, engineers, plumbers, electricians, and other skilled labor. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architects <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-work-with-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specialize in bringing ideas to fruition</a>, and they must communicate with homeowners at a high level. An architect must have a crystal-clear vision of how to transform the current home into the space you dream of. Getting the input of the architect as early in the process as possible will be invaluable in helping you mentally walk through the steps in advance. Sweeten design-build firms have in-house architectural services. Alternatively, Sweeten contractors can refer an architect if the project needs one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gutting a home is a major project. Having an understanding of the process with the guidance of the right general contractor and team sets you on a path for a smoother renovation. And a step closer to your dream home. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out the cost of renovating a house can be nerve-wracking for first-time Chicago renovators. You’ve finally moved on from daydreaming to starting a remodel of your home. Start by gathering some basic details: know what you can actually afford, and plan to add a small reserve on top of that. The materials you want to use also factor in, as well as how much work will be done. Plus, everything that isn’t visible—the infrastructure—will impact your costs. This can be a lot to keep track of, especially if this is your first time renovating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, we have done some of the legwork in this guide to Chicago remodeling costs. This guide focuses on some of the major remodeling categories: <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole house remodels</a>, kitchen, bath, additions—as well as permits. You can use these details to create an accurate budget for a Chicago-area renovation.</span></p>
<h3>Baseline home renovation costs in Chicago</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs (including labor and materials) gathered from <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-home renovation: From </span><b>$105</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot (psf) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget bath remodel: </span><b>$16,500 </b>(standard full size)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade bath remodel: </span><b>$26,000 </b>(standard full size)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end bath remodel: </span><b>$37,500 </b>(standard full size)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget kitchen remodel: </span><b>$23,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  (medium-sized)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: </span><b>$35,500 <span style="font-weight: 400;">(medium-sized)</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end kitchen remodel: </span><b>$72,000 <span style="font-weight: 400;">(medium-sized)</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basement remodel: </span><b>$40,000—$75,000</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p><b>Pro tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3>Chicago remodeling costs per square foot</h3>
<h4>Gut renovation vs. non-gut renovation</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutting a home pretty much means starting from scratch. You&#8217;ll take everything down to the studs or framework, and/or you&#8217;ll knock down walls. Because it&#8217;s more intricate, the average cost to gut and remodel a house starts at the higher end of the </span><b>$100 to $200</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf range. By contrast, a remodel of the space within existing walls will be at the lower end. For example, remodeling a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom condo may range from </span><b>$50,000 to $70,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while a gut reno likely will exceed </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This work usually involves running new plumbing pipes and wiring, moving doorways, and possibly installing new flooring.</span></p>
<h4>Full home gut renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs for a full home gut renovation start at </span><b>$105</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot. Take note: this scope of work is extensive! Expect demo, framing, insulation and drywall, wiring, plumbing, heating/cooling systems, millwork, paint, flooring, tile, light fixtures, electronics, and all finishes. (This excludes appliances, which can significantly increase costs, depending on how high-end they are.) According to Chicago-based</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Ryan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “A whole-house renovation—say, 3,000 square feet—would cost </span><b>$200,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at the low end, and start at </span><b>$400,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the high end. It all depends on the materials chosen.”</span></p>
<h4>Wet room renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wet rooms—connected to a water supply, such as bathrooms or kitchens—typically start at </span><b>$250</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. In the city, bathrooms in condos or co-ops can be as small as 30 square feet. However, in freestanding homes, they are typically larger than 5’ x 8’.  High-end renovations that are fully custom with luxury materials can cost upwards of </span><b>$700</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot. Architectural design and drawings, demolition, construction, materials, fixtures, lighting, and finishes are included in the fee.</span></p>
<h4>Build in a buffer to your budget</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractors may build in overage fees to their estimates. This allows for the unexpected<span>—</span>which definitely can happen<span>—</span>to be covered. Overages are usually 10-15% of the project cost. (We recommend that the renovator reserve at least 10-15% above the bid as well). Don&#8217;t let the numbers shock you, though: the beauty of</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring <span style="font-weight: 400;">a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it&#8217;s one-stop shopping. Working with a contractor covers pretty much <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the trades required for the job</a>. This spares you the work of hiring individual tradesmen to complete the various aspects of your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago-based</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6105#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Brad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommends being realistic about how much you can spend. “You can’t buy a <strong>$100,000</strong> ring on a <strong>$5,000</strong> budget. Nail down your contractor first; they know pricing. And add 15 percent for unexpected conditions.”</span></p>
<h3>Average cost of a kitchen remodel in Chicago</h3>
<h4>Budget kitchen renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-kitchen-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of remodeling a kitchen</a>, the typical starting point is <strong>$23,500</strong> based on a 100-square-foot space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This translates to stock cabinets from a big-box store with space to fit <span>a refrigerator, a four-burner range, a dishwasher, and a microwave. Materials could include laminate flooring, tile under $10 / square foot, and fixtures by Delta and American Standard.</span></span></p>
<h4>Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have found that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamping a kitchen</a> measuring 100 square feet at this finish level can start at <strong>$35,500</strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span>Opting for mid-grade materials is a smart way to strike a balance between cost efficiency and quality. Some reputable options to consider include Diamond or Kemper cabinets, Caesarstone countertops, Daltile floors, and tiles from TileBar and Ann Sacks. For fixtures, brands like Brizo, Hansgrohe, and Kohler offer reliable choices. </span></span></p>
<h4>High-end kitchen costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on what we have seen, expect starting costs to be <strong>$37,500</strong> for a 100-square-foot room at this finish level. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect quality and craftsmanship with top-flight <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a>, stone or porcelain flooring, stone or quartz countertops, and tile from brands like <span>Cle Tile and Artistic Tile.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Ryan has seen kitchens cost </span><b>$50,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a gut remodel, and at the high end, closer to </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Those figures,” he says, “can vary greatly, as some cabinetry alone might cost </span><b>$80,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<h3>Average bathroom remodel costs in Chicago</h3>
<h4>Budget bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare for a bathroom remodel</a>, you&#8217;ll need to settle on a realistic budget. A starting point can be </span><b>$16,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a standard full bathroom with <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget-friendly finishes</a> from big box stores like Home Depot, Menards, and Lowe’s. Other materials for this budget <span>include stock vanities, </span>various tiles under $5/square foot,<span> and fixtures by Delta, Moen, and Pfister. </span>As this is a wet space, plumbing, electrical insulation, and exhausts, as well as correcting misaligned walls and floors will be part of the job.</span></p>
<h4>Mid-grade bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A standard full bathroom typically includes <span>a sink, toilet, and bathtub or shower. The fixture count for a full bath is 3–4. Starting costs</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to overhaul a bathroom</a> is around </span><b>$26,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, standard toilet, fixtures by Kohler and Hansgrohe, vanity counter from Signature Hardware, and a porcelain tub.</span></p>
<h4>High-end bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The typical cost at this finish level starts at <strong>$37</strong></span><b>,500</b> for a standard-size bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features at this level include custom work, separate shower, freestanding tub, and custom lighting. High-end materials can include vanities by Robern and Duravit, fixtures by Brizo, and tile by Artistic Tile and Ann Sacks.</span></p>
<h3>Costs for a primary bedroom suite addition</h3>
<h4>Mid-grade primary suite addition costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimated costs are around </span><b>$452</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or </span><b>$177,273</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a 24&#8242; x 16&#8242; space, including double vanity, freestanding tub, separate shower, walk-in closet, dressing area. Whether it’s a ground-level addition, a basement remodel, or a second-floor addition, accessing rough-ins for plumbing will vary and affect pricing.</span></p>
<h4>High-end primary suite addition costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a 32&#8242; x 20&#8242; primary suite with a separate sitting area and large primary bath over a crawl space, costs are around </span><b>$553 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">psf or </span><b>$359,232</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This kind of project includes custom shelving, built-in storage, as well as a walk-in closet and dressing area with windows.</span></p>
<h3>Basement renovation costs in Chicago</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A starting budget for a basement is around </span><b>$100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. At the low end, average renovation costs are around </span><b>$40,000, </b>which<span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes a bathroom with a shower. Flooring options can vary significantly, including laminate, vinyl, engineered wood, porcelain tile, or stained concrete. At the high end, a project for </span><b>$75,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may include a 5&#8242; x 8&#8242;-foot bathroom with a shower, a wet bar, and flooring in an overall space measuring 20&#8242; x 30&#8242;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement renovation</a> can be affected by multiple factors. Consider the existing condition of the space, if plumbing pipes need to be installed or moved, if new water service is required and if bracing needs to be done to eliminate structural supports in the middle of a space. Also take into consideration ceiling height, since Chicago basements are typically 8 feet or less, and as low as 6’7″. If you want to raise the ceiling, that requires digging out and underpinning the foundation. In addition, it’s necessary to assure the space is waterproof. A perimeter drain tile system is installed (repaired or extended). Connecting it to a sump pump also is important to consider, and this cost can start at around </span><b>$2,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>Chicago remodeling costs for permits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The permit process for renovating varies from Chicago to its suburbs, with each of the village’s or town’s governing bodies determining requirements and fees. In Chicago, permits are obtained through the Building Department. The issue in common is safety and compliance with building codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Winnetka, remodeling permits cost </span><b>$30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per </span><b>$1,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of construction; new construction is </span><b>$1.30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot of new gross area. There also are permit fees for plumbing, electrical service (</span><b>$9,800</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 200 amp service; </span><b>$21,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 400 amp service), furnace, and AC as well as roofing and pools. In Hinsdale, the permit fee for remodeling is calculated on two percent of the value of construction.  In addition, expect to pay permit fees for demolition (</span><b>$3,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chicago, applications for building permits must include architectural drawings and names of all licensed contractors—plumbers, electricians, HVAC contractors (usually supplied by the general contractor). There is no one size fits all. But expect to pay between </span><b>$1,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>$2,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> minimally for a whole house remodel, major kitchen, and/or bath.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an Easy Permit Program for small projects that do not require architectural drawings (usually available the same day).

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639639880629"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a house in Chicago?</u></strong> </strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">If you’re doing a gut renovation in Chicago, budget from $100—$200 per square foot (costs will be lower for a non-gut). For any renovation, wet rooms—spaces with plumbing, like kitchens and bathrooms—will cost more than dry rooms. Materials and finish level will heavily impact costs. Budget-conscious Chicago homeowners should consider big-box stores for savings, while those with bigger budgets may opt for fully custom features or foreign-sourced items.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639639894139"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Chicago?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Chicago homeowners will likely spend $22,000—$31,000+ for a budget-level kitchen remodel. A mid-range Chicago kitchen remodel will start near $30,000 for 100 square feet of space; while larger kitchens (200 square feet) will cost between $60,000—$80,000. For a luxury kitchen remodel in Chicago, costs can increase to $80,000—$160,000 for a fully-custom, gut-renovated space with premium finishes.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639639907704"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Chicago?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">For a 5’ x 7’ Chicago bathroom with budget-level finishes, costs will start between $15,000—$20,000. For a mid-grade bathroom remodel, costs will start between $21,000—$28,000+. A smaller (35 square foot) high-end bathroom remodel could cost about $30,000, but larger bathrooms (approximately 200 square feet) can easily cost $80,000+.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whether you own a modern beach-side condo, an on-the-bay house, or a bungalow away from it all on a quiet street, the process of doing a remodel in Miami can be enjoyable—with a rewarding outcome. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A budget is the start of any renovation, and every project is unique: from materials, adding value and lifestyle to your home, and working with the HOA.<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s3">Sweeten</span></a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their project, offers this cost guide to remodeling in Miami to provide a jumping-off point to get you on your way. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Remodeling costs per square foot in Miami</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of the typical </span>costs to remodel in Miami, <span class="s1">Florida. The costs are across five categories: full home, kitchen, bathroom, deck additions, and permits. These figures are compiled from Sweeten general contractors and <i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/"><span class="s3"> Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Full home renovation:<b> </b>Starting at <b>$100 &#8211; $250+ </b>per square feet (psf) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$150</b> psf or <b>$15,000</b> (based on 100 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$325</strong> psf or <strong>$32,500</strong> (based on 100 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Staring at <strong>$650</strong> psf or <strong>$65,000</strong> (based on 100 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$300</b> psf or <strong>$10,500</strong> (based on 35 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$570</b> psf or <b>$19,950</b> (based on 35 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$630</b> psf or <b>$22,050</b> (based on 35 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Basic wood deck addition: <b>$40</b> psf or <b>$13,000</b> (based on 325 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Concrete patio addition with roof, electrical, plumbing, and a cooking area: <b>$50,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3 class="p6">How much does it cost to remodel a home in Miami?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you’re renovating a house in the Miami area, expect costs to range from <b>$100</b> to <b>$250+</b> psf with <b>$175</b> psf as the middle range for a full-scale remodel. If you&#8217;re aiming for a budget that is in the upper-middle-range, Miami-based<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">Sweeten general contractor Adrian</span></a> said you can expect to pay over <b>$200,000</b> or about <b>$200</b> psf. However, several elements affect this, like square footage, the state of the original home, and how expensive your tastes are. &#8220;It has all to do with the finishes,” Adrian said. By finishes, he means the elements you can see such as tiles, faucets, and kitchen countertops. With materials, plan to add to the timeline for installation and materials and labor costs. Using higher-end finishes will push your budget upwards by at least $50,000, he said. With the pandemic, material and labor costs have gone up due to higher demand. “There’s been a 20 percent in materials,” said Adrian.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The budget for renovating an apartment can be higher than house renovations. “If you’re doing a house, often you can work on the weekends,” said Adrian. In a condo, there are tight rules about when construction work can and can’t be done. These hours are put in place by the<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/a-guide-to-an-hoa-before-you-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">homeowners association</span></a> (HOA) for each building. Often, this means only working within an eight-hour or so window Monday to Friday. This extends the timeline of a project, thus increasing the budget. HOAs might also charge a condo owner a fee to remodel their apartment. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Disposing of trash adds to the cost of condo renovations. With a house, a general contractor can park a dumpster out the front. For condo remodels, general contractors will likely hire a separate contractor to come and lug construction trash away. This involves negotiating tight hallways and elevators as well as timeframes given by the HOA.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p6">How much does it cost to remodel a kitchen in Miami?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">A kitchen renovation in the budget value range can come in starting at <strong>$150</strong> psf or <b>$15,000</b> for a space measuring around 100 square feet, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6366#overview"><span class="s3">Hancen, a Sweeten general contractor</span></a> in Miami. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners should look at materials like pre-made shaker-style cabinets and appliances from big-box stores like Home Depot. “I’ve also noticed a trend for concrete countertops,” said Hancen. “These can be cheaper than quartz, but they take more to maintain,” adding that a sealant needs to be applied annually. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">For a mid-grade kitchen remodel in Miami, Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$325</strong> psf or <strong>$32,500</strong> for a 100-square-foot room. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, a mid-range kitchen remodel costs on average<b> $73,645</b>. This works out to <b>$368</b> psf for a 200-square foot space. Almost 54 percent of that cost is recouped in the value it adds to a home. The example kitchen the report gave was 200 square feet with laminate countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also contained a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than the addition of a kitchen island, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher were installed, remained the same as the original design. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6512#overview">Sweeten general contractor Domenico</a></span><span class="s1">, also servicing Miami, recently completed a kitchen renovation in this price range. It included a countertop made from Dekton, a stain-, scratch-, heat-, and UV-resistant material. The cabinets were custom with self-closing doors, which took <b>$40,000</b> from the budget. The appliances were from GE. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Sweeten has seen high-end kitchen renovations in Miami start at <strong>$650</strong> psf or <strong>$65,000</strong> for a 100-square-foot space. The 2021 Cost Vs Value Report quotes <b>$145,718</b> for this finish level, adding the same amount of value to a home’s resale value—50 percent—as a mid-range kitchen remodel. This included custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances were also upgraded, including a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, plus designer faucets and a water filtration system. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Miami?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">At the budget level, expect a solid rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to come in starting at <b>$10,500</b> for a 35-square-foot room. Contractor Hancen specializes in bathrooms for the Miami area. He has completed a very basic 50-square-foot bathroom for <b>$300</b> psf, he said. However, this is contingent on the layout staying the same and having no issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. If you’re after this price, stick to a prefabricated vanity and ceramic tiles, which come out to about <b>$2</b> psf. When it comes to faucets, toilets, and bathtubs, the brand American Standard is a good example of affordable, quality products. “These are the most well-priced materials I’ve seen and the most popular,” said Hancen. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">The next step up is a mid-grade bathroom renovation. Expect the starting costs for this finish level to be <strong>$570</strong> psf or <strong>$19,950</strong> based on a 35-square-foot space. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, the average cost for this type of bathroom remodel in Miami is about <b>$22,567</b> and about <b>$644</b> psf. The example bathroom the report gave was a 5’ x 7’ space and involved installing a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a lit and recessed medicine cabinet. A renovation in this vein can add about <b>$12,051</b> to a home’s value. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">A high-end bathroom remodel in the Miami area starts at <strong>$630</strong> psf or <strong>$22,050</strong> for a 35-square-foot space. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, the average price in this category is around <b>$70,286</b>. For this budget, you could expand your bathroom to around 100 square feet and can play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You’re also likely to afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom drawers, and wall cabinets. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost of tiles can add up. On a recent project, Domenico’s client picked out a tile that had the appearance of wood and cost <b>$20</b> psf. Another client wanted a wave pattern created out of tiles. “It was more difficult to install adding to the labor costs,” he said. “Occasionally, breakages happen, so that also needs to be covered.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The good news is this is an investment with about 48 percent of the budget added to your home’s sale price. </span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s1">Adding outdoor space to your home</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Florida, there is plenty of sun and enviable weather to take advantage of by renovating or adding an outdoor space to your home. Many Miami residents will use these spaces as an additional living space and even kitchen. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">For one project, Sweeten contractor Adrian added a 900 square foot patio to a house that had a budget of <b>$50,000</b>. “It was essentially another room to the house without the walls,” he said. It had a tiled roof supported by four columns, which was necessary so the structure could withstand a powerful hurricane. The flooring was Cuban tiles and there were fans and lighting so electrical work was required. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, a 16&#8242;</span> x 20&#8242;  wood deck costs <strong>$15,216</strong> and <strong>$20,879</strong> for a composite one in the Miami area. <span class="s1">If you went for a simple wood deck in a simple linear pattern, you could recoup close to 67 percent of the budget in the bump it gives to your home value. For this price, you could get a built-in bench and planter with stairs and railings. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s1">Permit costs in Miami</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost of permits, from a typical building permit to electrical, mechanical, and plumbing permits, are calculated in<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/permits/library/fees/building-fee-schedule.pdf"><span class="s3">different ways</span></a>. Some permit costs are calculated by square footage. Some are calculated by the value of a project so an exact figure can take some time to figure out. That’s why general contractor Adrian puts an estimate in the initial budget. For example, with a <b>$250,000</b> renovation, he puts a budget placeholder of <b>$1,500</b> for the main building permit with an additional <b>$500</b> each for plumbing, electrical and mechanical, if the project requires it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Miami-Dade county covers a huge amount of land and almost three million people. Each city—such as Miami South and Miami Lakes—in the county has a building official who issues permits for projects located within that city’s jurisdiction. Residential permits typically take 30 business days to process. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These Miami remodeling costs are a launchpad so you can begin creating an initial budget. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist</a> is a downloadable<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">roadmap to organize</span> all of the moving parts of a renovation.

			<h2>Here&#8217;s what influences full-home renovation costs in NYC — from permits and construction to hidden costs</h2>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Click to read our most up-to-date NYC <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitchen Remodeling Costs here</a> and NYC <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs here</a></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Sweeten general contractors, the typical price range for an entire home remodel in NYC is <b>$100 to $200 per square foot (psf)</b>. </span><span class="s1">This standard starting range includes both labor and materials, and represents costs averaged across both “wet” spaces, like <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">bathrooms</span></a> and<a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"> kitchens</span></a>, and “dry” spaces, like living rooms, bedrooms, and offices. This is because wet space remodels tend to be far more expensive per square foot, with a higher density of materials, finishes, and specialized labor (think plumbing, tiling, and more). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a more specific breakdown of typical NYC home renovation costs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/">Full-home renovation</a> in NYC: <b>$100—$200 psf</b> </span>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Dry spaces: <b>$30–$50 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Wet spaces: Baths start at<b> $400 psf; </b>kitchens start at <b>$300 psf</b> </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Gut remodel with stock materials:<b> $100–$200 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Non-gut remodel with stock materials:<b> $100 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Gut remodel with customization:<b> $200–$300 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Non-gut remodel with customization:<b> $200 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Structural changes, extensive customization:<b> $300 psf </b>and<b> up</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: From<b> $2,000–</b><b>$5,000</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Electrical permits:<b> $900</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500–$1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><b>Scheduling tip:</b> Don&#8217;t wait. There&#8217;s a backlog in the supply of construction materials. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/">schedule and sign with a contractor</a> to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost for a gut renovation vs. a non-gut</span></h3>
<p class="p1">As you <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan out your home remodel</a>, there’s a difference in cost, process, and scope between a gut and non-gut project. <span class="s1">In a gut renovation, interior walls are stripped down to the studs or knocked out entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A gut will start at the higher end of the <b>$100 </b>to<b> $200 psf </b>range, while a renovation in which you redo the space within the existing walls will be on the lower end. For example, in a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment, a renovation will come in around the <b>$50,000</b> to <b>$70,000</b> range, while a gut renovation will likely exceed <b>$100,000</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The non-gut renovation may involve a new kitchen and bath, as well as refinishing flooring, replastering and <span class="s2">painting</span>, plus upgrades in materials and finishes. The gut renovation will include the above as well as replacing the walls and flooring, and possibly installing new piping and wiring systems and moving doorways.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49030 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation costs" width="1000" height="745" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1-600x447.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given that New York City apartments vary widely and can present unique challenges, a per-square-foot estimate is really a ballpark figure for you to get started. Here’s an overview:</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Basic costs for an NYC home renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When estimating price per square foot, the scope of work usually includes the following:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Basic demolition </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Framing: the skeletal, load-bearing structure to which the interior walls and other systems are attached </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Insulation and drywall </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Wiring, including outlets and switches </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Plumbing </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Heating/cooling systems </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">All visible materials and fixtures in kitchens and baths (described below) </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t include appliances. Also bear in mind that the choices you make for visible materials—tile, flooring, millwork, paint, lighting fixtures, electronics, and more—can significantly affect the price of your renovation.</span></p>
<h4>At the $100 to $200 psf range:</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Materials are generally prefabricated or stock items and in finishes that are available at common retail outlets. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Cabinets in this price range are typically MDF (medium-density fiberboard). </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Tiling will run under <b>$10</b> <b>psf</b>. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Lighting will be standard but solid basics. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Solid wood floors may be shorter, narrower planks made of less expensive woods. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">The work will be careful, clean, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/home-remodel-bay-ridge-brooklyn-pre-war-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-installed at this level</a> with higher quality labor and skillsets at the upper end of the range. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">At <b>$200</b> to <b>$300</b> <b>psf </b>range:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Some customization on details such as joints, millwork, and hardware</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Cabinets are custom or semi-custom and can include built-ins. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countertops in natural stone or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-quality manufactured materials.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"> Solid, wide-planked hardwood flooring</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Projects at this price point are not usually gut renovations, but rather remodels that focus on the space within the existing walls.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">One thing to note</span><span class="s1">: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote</span><span class="s5">.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">What you’ll get for <b>$300 per square foot</b> and higher:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>$300</b> <b>psf</b> or above will usually pay for layout changes or structural work, such as <span class="s3">combining apartments</span>. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving walls, adding staircases, shifting gas and plumbing, and electrical rewiring all contribute to a higher per-square-foot cost, as well as add to the behind-the-scenes expenditures (more on that below). </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Since pricing for kitchens and baths runs higher than other rooms, more of those equal a higher price per square foot. For example, renovating a 1,000-square-foot apartment that has three bathrooms will be more expensive than an apartment of the same size with just one bathroom.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this level and beyond, you can expect to see more extensive customization, fine finishes, and luxurious materials. This includes handmade tile, exotic wood grains, natural stone, and custom millwork details that complement the home’s architecture. You might also see custom door casements and extensive lighting details.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Design</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on your general contractor and your level of involvement in the project, you may also want or need professional design services. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">You may need an architect. Architect approvals are required any time you make changes to the structure or to plumbing or gas lines. Many Sweeten general <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors in NYC</a> can refer architects for your project.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">You may consider a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">design/build firm</span></a>, which combines design and construction services within one fee and contract. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Building and city requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a co-op or condo building, you’ll likely need to submit your plans drawn by an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">architect</span></a> to your building’s board. Co-ops are generally stricter about renovations than condo buildings, though many condos are now adopting more stringent rules as well. Buildings may also have minimum requirements for construction insurance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some alteration agreements require a security deposit to cover potential damage. They may also include the fees incurred by the condo or co-op board to review and approve your plan. You may find that contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive specifications have higher rates in order to meet higher insurance requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NYC Department of Buildings requires that you obtain permits and inspections for many types of construction work, including plumbing, electrical, and structural. Permits can add up. An electrical permit can run close to <b>$900</b>, plumbing permits can cost from under <b>$2,000</b> to <b>$5,000</b>, and an asbestos inspection can be <b>$500</b>.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Demolition and site prep</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the state of the original space, you may need to do extensive preparatory work after demolition and before installation. Older apartments will almost always require stripping, leveling, and plastering. Uneven floors and walls must be leveled before cabinets can be hung, doors framed, or tiling installed. These costs are determined by the general contractor once they have a chance to examine your space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Behind-the-scenes costs</span></h4>
<p>Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as t<span class="s1">he main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts, from what we have seen,&#8221; said an NYC Sweeten contractor. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compared to costs for the &#8220;visible&#8221; parts of your renovation, pricing for the &#8220;unseen” costs can be difficult to anticipate. While labor is a clear one, keep in mind that different forms of labor can be priced very differently. Wiring and plumbing work, for example, tend to be expensive. And over the past year, master plumbers and electricians have seen costs go up, “primarily due to the safety measures and certifications that have been imposed on these trades by the Department of Buildings,” said <span class="s3">Sweeten</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">NYC general contractor Aaron</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plumbing generally runs between <b>$1,500</b> to <b>$2,000</b> per fixture in New York City. So, prepare for at least <b>$5,000</b> for a licensed plumber to run new lines for a sink, toilet, and bathtub. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Skim coating,</span></a><span class="s3"> a technique</span> that smoothes a wall, hiding all imperfections, is the most expensive type of labor. In some cases, it can be more affordable to tear down old walls and put up new drywall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider that from the contractor’s perspective, “labor” on the budget proposal may include not only the hourly rate they pay their workers, but also insurance, license, and other overhead fees that keep their business running. (Contractors typically take home 10-15% profit. For example, if they do $2 million worth of business this year, they are netting about $200k.) Insurances and other costs of running a business increase year over year, and while the costs are not passed 1:1 to the client, contractors must raise prices to maintain operations. Some show a specific line on the budget for profit/overhead, while others build it into other budget lines.</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Tips on how to budget your NYC home renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you’ve accounted for each line item in your budget, allocate an additional 10 to 15 percent as a cushion. Projects can run over budget as a result of unforeseen circumstances, so it’s good to err on the safe side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many factors go into the per-square-foot estimates. Trying to come up with a plan to match your budget? Here are some tips from contractors and renovating homeowners:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Mix high and low.</b> This refers to materials, which should be selected for maximum impact. You may choose a handmade tile for the kitchen backsplash while sticking to an off-the-shelf option for the second bath. Make a custom statement where it will really get noticed, and use standard materials where it won’t.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Don’t skimp on plumbing and electrical infrastructure.</b> Although these aspects probably won’t get you many compliments at a dinner party, you still need licensed and qualified experts for these jobs. If you don’t, there may be expensive problems to deal with in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Focus on kitchens and baths.</b> Spend your money here! A <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen upgrade</a> and a refreshed bathroom have the most resale value impact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Consult experts upfront.</b> If you are inclined to hire an architect or designer for a major transformation, get them on board early. This can save money by mapping out a clear plan, helping you avoid costly changes mid-stream. Set aside 15 to 20 percent of your budget for this professional. In general, hiring licensed professionals early is a cost-effective way to prevent insurance headaches later on by using their expertise to avoid mistakes that can lead to delays.</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1"></span></a></p>

			<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639032991721"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u><strong><u>How much does a gut renovation cost in New York City?</u></strong></u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">An average full-home renovation in NYC will cost between $100-200 per square foot. A gut renovation will start at the higher end of the $100-$200 psf range. “Wet spaces” with plumbing have higher gut costs: kitchens will cost, on average, $300 per square foot, and bathrooms, $400 psf. Gut renovating dry spaces without plumbing will cost between $30–$50 psf.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639033036055"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in NYC?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">The visible parts of a bathroom—tile, sinks, vanities, tubs/showers—will directly impact end costs, as will the type of work being done (gut renovation vs. rip-and-replace.) In New York City, a budget remodel of a bathroom will start at $600 psf; or $21,000 for a 35 square-foot space. Mid-grade bathrooms start at $700 psf, or $24,500 for a 35 square-foot space. High-end remodels will start at $850 psf, or $68,000 for an 80 square-foot space.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639033047979"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What renovations increase NYC home value the most?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Kitchen and bathroom renovations have the most resale value in NYC homes. Even doing a more budget-friendly “rip-and-replace” renovation (where old appliances and cabinets are swapped out for new ones, with no changes made to the room layout,) can lead to returns when selling in the competitive NYC housing market.</p>

<p><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Start planning your kitchen renovation now. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of many construction materials and fixtures. For homeowners interested in remodeling, it’s smart to quickly sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. We also advise locking in a start date on the contractor’s calendar. Waiting could lead to longer delays, and even more severe price inflation on materials.</span> <em><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—at no cost to you.</span></em></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">From budget to high-end kitchen appliances and finishes </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Appliances, fixtures, and finishing materials all lie on a spectrum, whether you&#8217;re doing a budget kitchen remodel or a high-end one. Your choice of quality level (often called &#8220;finish level&#8221;) is a major factor in the cost of a kitchen renovation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Budget” kitchen materials are generally off-the-shelf items from “big box” stores or IKEA. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Mid-grade” kitchen materials balance cost with quality. Examples include engineered wood flooring and products from GE, Caesarstone, Kohler, or Benjamin Moore. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“High-end” kitchen materials prioritize quality over cost. Products include hardwood flooring or marble, and brands like Bertazzoni, Ann Sacks, and Farrow &amp; Ball. This category may also include special materials sourced from overseas suppliers, and fully custom fabrications.</span></p>

<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A note about cabinetry: In high-end kitchens that feature custom millwork, the cabinetry often accounts for a high percentage of both materials and labor costs. The starting point for basic custom cabinetry is <b>$1,000</b> per linear foot. There are many other factors—drawers are costlier than shelves, and features such as Lazy Susans, pull-out pantries, specialized compartments, and soft-close hinges all increase costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom cabinets are not just for large houses; apartment owners with limited kitchen depth may benefit even more by going custom. Shallower cabinets can fit tighter spaces, while deeper cabinets can hold larger dinner plates and platters. You may also have an odd-shaped space or awkward corner that you&#8217;d like to accommodate with a cabinet, to maximize a small kitchen&#8217;s storage. Choices like these require custom work, because prefabricated cabinets offer fewer options.

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Kitchen renovation costs for permits, design, and behind-the-scenes items</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The average kitchen remodel costs are comprised of both visible and invisible items. Here are the &#8220;invisible&#8221; behind-the-scenes budget items to keep on your radar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building boards / HOAs can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs for apartment owners. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to alteration agreements that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands.</span></p>
<h4>City permits</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing services:<b> $2,000 –</b> <b>$3,500. </b> Possibly higher, if you have more than the usual number of plumbing fixtures. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: <b>$2,000 –</b> <b>$5,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500</b> – <b>$1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City’s Department of Buildings requires a permit for any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture. Adding outlets or electrical circuits will require an electrical permit. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on your building’s requirements and any work that requires opening the walls.</span></p>
<h4>Design costs for kitchen renovation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the design stage, you&#8217;ll collaborate with the professionals you hire, who will create detailed drawings for all the tradespeople to follow. The design will cover details of the room footprint, plumbing, cabinetry, counters, sinks, backsplashes, flooring, lighting, hardware, and appliances. Kitchen renovation design costs will depend on the scope, and also who you hire. In some cases, your Sweeten general contractor will have design experience and will be able to make recommendations and draw up basic plans. For a higher level of service, some general contractors operate full-service design/build firms, with dedicated designers on staff. Some contracting firms also have architects on staff; many can refer an architect. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">If you are considering major layout changes, such as removing walls, rerouting gas or plumbing lines, and rewiring electrical, you are looking at spending at least <b>$32,000</b> for a basic kitchen gut. If you are considering this kind of transformative work, you’ll need architectural designs from a registered architect and to plan for the cost of permits, building approvals, high insurance coverage requirements, and more involved oversight from your general contractor. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">These “soft costs”—expenses critical to the success of the work but often invisible or unforeseen—can represent 15 to 20% of the total cost of a kitchen renovation.

<h4><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png"><img decoding="async" title="cost-estimate-of-demolition-and-site-preparation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png" alt="Cost estimate of demolition and site preparation" width="1080" height="551" class="alignnone wp-image-51063 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-300x153.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-600x306.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></h4>
<h4>Demolition and site prep</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the site prep stage, your general contractor needs to do significant work behind the scenes to ensure that your kitchen renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be pulled out and disposed of—this can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. Your contractor will probably need to strip the walls and flooring in order to frame and level the room. This step is labor-intensive, typically costing around<b> $4,000</b>. Other site prep includes protecting surfaces and valuables outside the renovation area, fixing any problems discovered within the walls, and adding insulation or waterproofing.</span></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is the main event. High-quality materials are only as good as the installation—if hinges are not properly aligned on drawers or cabinets, or if the shelving is not completely level, these faults can make the work look shoddy, can make your kitchen harder to use, and can lead to your expensive fixtures aging poorly. Appliances are often installed by the store where you made the purchase (as a built-in cost or an added delivery/installation fee), while countertop suppliers often also manage installation. If installation costs aren&#8217;t included in an item&#8217;s purchase price, they&#8217;ll typically fall under the “general construction” or “labor” budget and be handled by your general contractor.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes kitchen renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurances, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-person crews to firms employing dozens of professionals (including designers, project managers, millworkers, laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s6">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span></a><span class="s1"> explained that as a business grows, costs also go up. “Insurances increase yearly, and anything related to MEPs (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) has also increased a bit as these subcontractors—especially plumbers—have seen an increase in their costs.” This is because the rules have become more stringent and there needs to be “more eyes on the project.” Additionally, he mentions, “Buildings are being more stringent on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to keep up with those needs.”</span></p>
<h4>Raw material costs</h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, the industry is affected by global trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen renovations in NYC</h3>
<h4>How long does a kitchen remodel take?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anywhere from 3 weeks to 4 months, depending on the complexity of your project. Will you be altering the room’s footprint? Changing or adding electric wiring, plumbing, or gas lines? Ordering custom cabinetry or millwork? Each of these options will add significant time. You may also encounter delays with the city’s permitting process, or with permission from your building’s board. </span></p>
<h4>Do you need a permit to remodel a kitchen?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ll be changing the kitchen’s footprint, making changes to wiring, gas lines, or plumbing, or removing asbestos, you’ll need the appropriate permits from the city. If you live in an apartment building, you’ll almost certainly need approval from the building’s board for any construction work. Discuss with your Sweeten general contractor if they’ll assist with the permit process which is typically 10% of the budget. </span></p>
<h4>How do I remodel a kitchen on a budget?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to make a clear, prioritized list of must-haves and nice-to-haves. Next, you should think about your wishes for appliance quality, quality of materials and fixtures, and overall finish level. Explore scaling back the biggest budget items: footprint changes, changes to wiring/plumbing/gas, custom cabinetry, and millwork, high-end appliances. Your Sweeten general contractor may help find creative solutions—like Ikea cabinets with a similar look to the custom ones you were considering, or ways to accomplish your goals without moving walls. Sweeten recommends setting aside a 10% contingency budget, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about unwelcome surprises.</span> Ready to budget for your NYC kitchen renovation costs?

<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Mid-grade remodel: Starting at <b>$700 </b>psf or <b>$24,500 </b>(based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">High-end remodel: Starting at <b>$850 </b>psf or <b>$68,000 </b>(based on a 80-sq-ft space)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in a bathroom renovation, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will continue to go up and your material order will start at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodeling an NYC bathroom all at once</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it can be tempting to apply à la carte prices to individual elements of the work, a full bathroom renovation is an integrated process that involves design, materials, installation, and plumbing. If your bathroom has one or two areas of concern, you might decide to swap out an individual fixture or two. You can replace a toilet or vanity or take on some limited retiling and pay solely for the cost of the new fixtures and the hours of installation work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, it can be misleading to break up and price out each step of a bathroom remodel. Even if you are just redoing fixtures and tile work, you may discover that you need to replace the sheetrock on the wall or address issues behind the walls, like old valves and ancient drain pipes. A gut renovation, which addresses the whole bathroom space, allows you to plan more broadly. By doing a gut renovation, you can get more work done, in the right sequence, and more cost-effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Budget to high-end costs for bathroom materials and finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Listed below are the visible parts of a bathroom renovation, and probably the aspect you’ve spent the most time thinking about. Review the range of pricing for various fixtures, materials, and finishes in the chart below. On the budget side, you’ll find items sourced from big-box stores like Home Depot, Walmart, or IKEA. Prices increase if you choose to use their interior boxes but upgrade or customize the function or style, such as the door fronts. On the high end are highly customized, handmade, or imported items.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel costs for permits, design, and everything behind-the-scenes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to visible upgrade items, there are unavoidable behind-the-scenes investments to consider when creating your budget.</span></p>
<h4>Building requirements impact bathroom remodeling costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those in apartments, building requirements can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to general <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/nyc-alteration-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">alteration agreements</span></a> that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s6">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Thomas</a></span><span class="s1"> explained, “Buildings are becoming less flexible on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to raise prices to keep up with those needs.” The contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands. </span></p>
<h4>NYC permit costs for a bathroom remodel</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing services: <b>$2,000 – $3,500</b> and higher </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as<b> $5,000</b> per permit </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tackling a NYC bathroom remodel means planning for plumbing services and permits. Any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture requires a permit from the City’s Department of Buildings, which can run up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as <b>$5,000</b> per permit. Plumbing is a specialized trade that often comes with hourly rates; expect to budget between <b>$2,000 </b>and<b> $3,500</b> (or higher) for a full bathroom remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re adding outlets or doing electrical work, an electrical permit may be needed, which can run close to <b>$900</b>. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on the building requirements and your plumbing plans, which cost <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b>.</span></p>
<h4>How design affects bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the design stage, plan to collaborate with the experts you hire to produce detailed drawings that account for all physical elements of the bathroom. A schematic drawing is usually presented to the building board as part of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">approval process</span></a>, which needs to outline the locations of the major fixtures as well as specifications for the vanity and tub/shower, and lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you plan to move the plumbing to convert a bathtub to a shower or vice versa, the permit alone to change the plumbing in NYC is <strong>$6,000</strong>. This is because you’ll need to hire a registered architect to file a permit application certifying that the plan complies with applicable codes and laws. An architect or interior designer will typically charge 15 to 20 percent of the project’s construction costs for his or her fee.</span></p>
<p>Sweeten general contractors can help provide architect referrals for a range of services, saving homeowners a step.</p>
<h4>Demolition and site prep for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this stage, labor is needed to ensure that your bathroom renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be disposed of, which can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. This difficulty will be reflected in the contractor’s rate. Almost without exception, your contractor may need to strip the walls and flooring to frame and level before any installation occurs. This behind-the-scenes step is critical and labor-intensive and can cost an average of <b>$2,000</b>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your home is new or the sub-floor is concrete, any leveling needs may be minimal. Otherwise, you probably need to account for floor leveling and new drywall or plastering before any surface work can get going.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exposing the existing conditions inside walls while leveling and framing will also allow your contractor to address plumbing or electrical issues before you hook up a new plumbing fixture. It may be necessary to replace all horizontal plumbing work to the building’s “stack” (the main vertical lines that run throughout the building) and run new wiring to head off plumbing and electrical problems that you may have unwittingly inherited. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll want to factor in costs that support the success and longevity of the work. Examples of this are prep work to protect floors and valuables (which can add <b>$600</b> to<b> $900</b>) and waterproofing steps (which can add <b>$1,000</b>). This is critical for the project’s foundation alignment and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGL_uAFyKzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Installation is the final stage to incorporate all of the bathroom renovation materials you’ve purchased. The craftsmanship involved in the installation of all the pieces will depend on the size of your bathroom and the degree of customization you need to make all of the pieces fit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PRO TIP: Expect to spend 30 percent or less of your total project cost on visible materials, fixtures, and finishes. The rest will go to behind-the-scenes costs, like labor, permits, and fees.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes for a bathroom renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Raw materials for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid-related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurance, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-men crews to much larger entities that employ dozens of staff (including designers, project managers, millworkers and laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, however, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year, though not necessarily dollar for dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s7">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Aaron</a> explained that in the last year, there have been specific increases of compliance, certificates, and safety measures imposed on MEP subcontractors (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) by the Department of Buildings leading to higher costs. </span><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<h4><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;bathroom remodeling new york&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:577,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Bathroom remodeling costs in New York in 2021</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have a fair amount of choice in deciding what to spend on the material aspects of a bathroom renovation. Less obvious are the costs that are the backbone and labor of the work overall, no matter what you spend on materials. Knowing what impacts cost during a bathroom renovation will allow you to better align your budget while avoiding surprises. </span></p>

<p>Renovating on Long Island? From the South Shore to the North Fork, we have the numbers you’ll need to plan your renovation&#8217;s budget. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> breaks down the costs on four major remodeling cost categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Although “Long Island” is technically a region that is home to four New York counties, including Kings County (better known as Brooklyn!) and Queens, this cost guide focuses on the portion of the island that is colloquially known as Long Island, which is primarily Nassau and Suffolk counties. This guide does not include the Hamptons, which is a world of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own with renovation prices</a> to match.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs that include labor and materials compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf) with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+</strong> psf</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> (under 100 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$75,000+</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$15,000—$20,000</strong> (35 to 40 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel: <strong>$21,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000+</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind while it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</p>
<h3>What does a Long Island home remodel cost per square foot?</h3>
<p>Long Island’s proximity to New York City and the Hamptons means that the same regional averages apply. However, real estate prices in Long Island are lower than their neighbors on both sides, and this affects renovation costs.</p>
<p>Most full-home Sweeten renovations in villages including Great Neck, New Hyde Park, and Bellport generally start at <strong>$100</strong> psf.<span style="color: #333333;"> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Aaron</a> estimates that cosmetic facelifts for dry rooms can be <strong>$30</strong>—<strong>$70</strong> psf </span><span style="color: #333333;">for his projects, while </span><span style="color: #333333;">wet rooms (rooms that are connected to a water supply, i.e., bathrooms or kitchens) typically start at <strong>$375</strong> per square feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In Sweeten&#8217;s experience, bathrooms in Long Island are typically larger than 5&#8217;x8&#8242; and can measure 8&#8243;x7&#8242; or 9&#8243;x7&#8242;. High-end (full custom, luxury materials) wet room renovations can cost well over <strong>$700</strong> per square foot. This cost range includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<h5>Fewer hurdles in Long Island</h5>
<p>Since most residential renovations in Long Island are for single-family, fully detached houses, the logistics of renovation are more straightforward. Contractors won&#8217;t need to worry about where to park a car or have limits on the permitted construction hours. (Even if there are city ordinances that limit noise, those are much longer than the working hours typically permitted by an NYC co-op.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, apartment buildings, whether condo or co-op, typically require contractors to ensure cleanliness in the hallways. When workers must spend the beginning and end of the workday prepping and cleaning the halls, this can take up precious time! These factors, which don’t impact most Long Island houses, can result in more affordable prices for those renovators.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Aaron tells us that, since construction was permitted to restart after the shutdown, clients are itching to get back to their renovations. The most common renovations he’s seeing are additions, dormers, kitchens, baths, pool pavers, and decks.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46398" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CTA-Find-NY-GCs.png" alt="Find New York General Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CTA-Find-NY-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CTA-Find-NY-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3>Costs for a Long Island kitchen renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can cost between <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. This typically means making use of engineered flooring, off-the-shelf cabinets, and an economical tile or butcher block for countertops. It also includes swapping out old appliances for energy-efficient models.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$30,000</strong>. <em>Remodeling</em>’s Cost vs. Value Report shows that a mid-grade, major kitchen renovation of a 200-square-foot space will run about <strong>$69,910</strong> based on averages for the Middle Atlantic region (as opposed to <strong>$84,484</strong> for New York City). This range covers updating 30 linear feet of semi-custom wood cabinets, an island, new countertops, a double-tub stainless steel sink, energy-efficient range, vented hood, built-in microwave, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and custom lighting. This comes to about <strong>$350</strong> psf.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5543#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Vita</a>, “Kitchens on Long Island typically need a full gut in order to upgrade electrical, plumbing, insulation, and correcting for settling of the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>High-end kitchen: Expect the budget to start at <strong>$75,000</strong>. The same Cost vs. Value report puts a luxury kitchen renovation around <strong>$137,700</strong> for the region. This will get you top-of-the-line custom cabinets with interior accessories, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, commercial-grade cooktop and hood, wall oven, built-in microwave, with designer faucets and a water filtration system. This budget also includes custom lighting, including under-cabinet lights, and wood flooring throughout. Broken down to price per square foot, this comes in at <strong>$689</strong> psf.</li>

<h3>Costs for a Long Island bathroom renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes. Sweeten contractor Vita said, “Bathroom remodels often need the same treatment as kitchens, and require a full overhaul of plumbing, electrical supplies, insulation, exhaust ductwork as well as floor and wall straightening. Our base price for a typically-sized, 35-square-foot bathroom renovation starts at <strong>$22,158</strong>, with material and subcontractor allowances.”</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom remodel for a 35-square-foot area will cost anywhere from <strong>$21,000</strong> to <strong>$40,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report provides an average of <strong>$22,158</strong> for the Middle Atlantic region. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, a solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: Sweeten contractors report high-end renovations range starts at <strong>$40,000</strong> and goes up at luxury price points. The same report puts a high-end renovation at <strong>$69,188</strong> for the region. This is based on the expansion of a 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, within the existing home&#8217;s footprint. A high-end renovation at this price point includes radiant floors, all new ductwork, custom cabinetry, separate shower, and freestanding tub, as well as custom lighting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Costs for a Long Island basement renovation</h3>
<p>Based on Sweeten&#8217;s numbers, the average basement conversion in Long Island comes in at <strong>$117</strong> psf. For a budget, we&#8217;ve seen projects start at <strong>$25,000</strong> and include a bathroom, shower, and laminate flooring. On the high end, a project costing <strong>$75,000</strong> would include a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring in 20’ x 30’ space.</p>
<p>This is in line with what is reported by Sweeten contractors. For example, Sweeten contractor Vita shares that Long Island basements generally run about <strong>$35,000</strong> for a budget, <strong>$60,000</strong> for a mid-grade renovation, and more than <strong>$60,000</strong> for a high-end project.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the existing condition of the space will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper so the ceiling appears higher, and the walls could require underpinning. Sometimes electricity and plumbing need to be installed, especially if there is no existing bathroom and that’s a crucial part of your plans. Installation and waterproofing can also be a significant cost if needed.</p>
<h3>Costs for permits</h3>
<p>In Long Island, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit. Towns throughout the island all levy different fees. In Suffolk County, for renovations up to <strong>$50,000</strong>, the permit fee is <strong>$250</strong>, and <strong>$500</strong> for renovations up to <strong>$100,000</strong>. For projects above <strong>$250,000</strong>, contractor Aaron estimates the cost is 15%  per <strong>$1,000</strong> for the permit. Plumbing and electrical permits both start at <strong>$50</strong>. For the full list, you can consult this fee schedule.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget. Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist offers you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a downloadable roadmap to organize</a> all of the moving parts of a renovation including laying out your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves,” so you can plan and get started off on the right foot.</p>

<h3>What is aging in place design? What does accessible design mean?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To some, &#8220;<strong>aging in place&#8221;</strong> is a design term that means creating living spaces that are safe and accessible for people who want to stay in their homes and care for themselves as they grow older. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To others, the term <strong>&#8220;accessible design&#8221;</strong> or &#8220;living in place&#8221; is more applicable, as it means designing spaces that suit the needs of children and adults in one home. In both cases, the goal is to create living spaces that are, safe, accessible, and also make design sense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gives an overview of aging in place design costs, plus costs for accessible designs, and gives tips for when these designs can be beneficial to the family lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does accessible design cost?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When part of a major renovation, the cost to include accessible techniques can be minor. &#8220;Things don&#8217;t necessarily need to cost more, they are just different,&#8221; said </span><span class="s3">Julie Schuster of <a href="https://www.jlsdesignstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Schuster Design Studio</a></span><span class="s1"> and is a certified living in place professional (CLIPP). &#8220;If you are remodeling a kitchen you probably want under cabinet lighting. Why not upgrade slightly to add bright LED lights that are good for aging eyes?&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two approaches to accessible living spaces: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to suit the urgent needs of the homeowner. </b> A wheelchair user will need, among other things, wide doorways and hallways, and a curbless shower with a bench and grab bars. A family with young children may want night lights in the hallways, non-slip bathroom floor tiles, and anti-scald shower valves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to make the design flexible for future improvements.</b> &#8220;It is important to learn the things that could crop up in the future and then design backward for them. I install blocking behind a shower wall while renovating, so grab bars or a built-in bench can be added later. Putting in the blocking does not add to the overall cost,&#8221; said Kammi Reiss of <a href="https://www.kammireissdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Kammi Reiss Design</span></a>.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Sweeten contractor Aaro</span>n</a>, being flexible in design is key. In one condo project, they placed a removable panel in front of the kitchen sink so a wheelchair user can roll up to the sink for use. </span></p>
<h3>What does aging in place cost?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While many accessible design techniques have similar costs as any renovation project,  some projects do have an increased cost. For example, the combination of slippery surfaces and a wet setting in bathrooms often cause accidents, especially for people with mobility issues or poor eyesight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#8217;s a comparison from the <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Cost vs. Value Report</a> that compares a standard  5-foot by 7-foot bathroom of mid-range quality to an accessible one of the same size. The accessible bathroom includes 36-inch-wide doors, flat panel electric switches installed at sitting level, walk-in curbless shower with fold-out seat, adjustable shower head, thermostatic mixing valve, LED lighting, ceramic tile walls with contrasting color stripes, towel bars (grab bars) that can support 250 pounds each, night lights, and reconfigured storage accessible to someone in a seated position, among other items.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s an example of what universal design can recoup at resale at a national level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Costs $24,424 recouping 60% at resale</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Standard universal design remodel: Costs $38,813 recouping 58% at resale</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;<i>Remodeling</i> asked us to revise the remodeling project for them,&#8221; said Louie Delaware, co-founder of the <a href="https://www.livinginplace.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Living in Place Institute</span></a>. &#8220;Everyone assumed that it would cost much more and would not be worth as much.&#8221;  While there are increased costs, the return on investment is similar to that of the accessible bathroom. </span></p>
<h3>Costs for accessible design projects:</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some estimated costs for common projects often associated with accessible designs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Entrance ramp: $1,300 to $ 3,500<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Door widening to accommodate wheelchairs: $400 to $800, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Chair lift: $3,000 to $6,000, curved stairs will cost more<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Widening hallways (often includes moving plumbing, heating and cooling and electrical lines):  $500 to $2,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Grab bars with decorative finishes: $100 to $200, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Curbless showers: $2,000 to $8,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Faucets with lever controls: $200 to $400<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the techniques used in accessible design or aging in place design are the same, whether planning for yourself, someone who wants to age in place, or to suit the needs of a growing family. The goal is to create a safe, accessible design for everyone to enjoy.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have compiled a guide to renovation costs across Westchester County, New York, focusing on four categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Westchester home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that Westchester County, with its close proximity to New York City, is one of the pricier areas when it comes to real estate. That is also reflected in the cost of renovations. <span style="color: #333333;">On average, many Sweeten projects can range from <strong>$100 </strong></span><strong>psf<span style="color: #333333;">—$250 </span>psf</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">. Based in Westchester, </span></span></span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Gregory</span></a> has worked on projects that involve multiple rooms or a gut renovation at the <strong>$250 psf range. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anything higher, he said, “usually applies to one or more specialty trades, such as architects or engineers, and insurance costs which factors into the overall budget.” Choice of material will also affect the cost per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, a higher cost stems from the quality and experience of the skilled workers the contractors hire for the project. “Costs for construction vary based on experience, which increases for a higher-end result,” said a <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor,</span> who handles projects in the Westchester area. For instance, “A presentation representing the finished product—design and organizing, scheduling, and advising on the materials—is a service that adds to the budget.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. Therefore, the prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester kitchen renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><span class="s3"><b>$25,000—$30,000</b></span><span class="s2"> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.</span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect to see starting budgets from </span><span class="s3"><strong>$40,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></span><span class="s2"> for a typical mid-grade kitchen.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">Westchester-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has worked on projects costing <b>$40,000</b> for 150 square feet, or about<b> $260 psf</b>. This budget includes mid-grade finishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span class="s5">Cost vs. Value report</span></a> puts <b>$350 psf</b> or <b>$70,000</b> total, as an average for Westchester County. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with standard finishes, like an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes garbage disposal, custom lighting, and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">High-end kitchen: Sweeten has seen projects start at <strong>$70,000</strong> for a high-end kitchen.<span class="s2"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6">In the Cost vs. Value report, the average high-end kitchen remodel cost <b>more than $137,000</b> for a 200-square foot space. </span><span class="s7">A project in that price range includes custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances can include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">According to Sweeten contractor Majid, a large part of a high-end kitchen can be attributed to the cabinets. For example, one of Majid&#8217;s clients recently spent <b>$50,000</b> on fully custom European cabinets.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester bathroom renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget bathroom: A budget bathroom renovation, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, can reach </span><span class="s3"><b>$16,000</b></span><span class="s2">, said Oziel. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Westchester County will cost on average </span><span class="s3"><b>$22,000</b>,</span><span class="s2"> according to the Cost vs. Value report, which is <b>$628 psf</b> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">High-end bathroom: Prices can start at around <strong>$32,000</strong> for a standard full bath with high-end finishes. However, homeowners are more likely to splurge for high-end in their master baths, bringing the starting cost for a typical high-end bathroom to around <strong>$46,000.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a higher budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost $2,000 apiece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. At times, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, good general contractors can strategize with a reasonable budget to help clients achieve renovation goals.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractors have worked on basement renovations that cost anywhere from <b>$20,000 to $75,000. </b>A<b> $20,000—$30,000 </b>or <b>$50/psf </b>budget would update an already finished basement. This includes painting, flooring, and lighting. If the space is raw and being <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated to a finished living area</a>, the cost is around <b>$75,000</b>. For this budget, a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC can be added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Majid, a simple basement remodel can cost as little as <b>$50 a square foot</b>, which works out to be about <b>$40,000</b> for an 800-square-foot space. Adding a toilet or shower could increase your budget, plus any necessary work to bring the room up to code. Waterproofing and drainage can also push up a basement project’s cost. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (by adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor. An average basement conversion in Westchester is <b>$75,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. A project with this budget includes a 20×30 foot room, a 5&#8217;×8&#8242; bathroom with a shower and bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to<b> $117 psf</b>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Westchester County. Typically, home renovation costs will be determined by your budget, and require some basic math to figure out. For example, the permit costs below are broken out among the different towns across the County:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Pelham</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost <b>$250</b> for a project costing under <b>$5,000</b> plus <b>$12</b> per each additional <b>$1,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Scarsdale</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost<b> $255</b> for a project costing between <b>$10,000</b> and <b>$50,000</b>. For projects budgeted over <b>$100,000</b>, a permit costs a flat fee of <b>$1,755</b> plus <b>$14</b> for each <b>$1,000</b> or fraction over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Katonah</span></span><span class="s1">: Permits cost <b>$14</b> for every <b>$1,000</b> of a budgeted project.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Hastings-on-Hudson</span></span><span class="s1">: The fee will cost <b>$17</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of the estimated construction cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is the ninth-largest city in the United States. It’s a headquarter for multiple Fortune 500 companies like American Airlines. There’s the Dallas Cowboys as well as real cowboys. And of course, there’s BBQ. Dallas is a thriving city and a great place to renovate your dream home.<span> </span></span><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>‘s guide to home remodeling costs in Dallas</span><span><span class="s3"> provides a jumping-off point to get you on your way. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Developing a budget is your first step to your dream home. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: starting at<span> </span><strong>$80 – $100</strong><span> </span>per square foot (psf)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Low-end kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$10,000 – $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$25,000 – $30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Low-end bathroom remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$8,000 – $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range bathroom remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$15,000 – $25,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at<span> </span><strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Deck composite:<span> </span><strong>$19,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$60</strong><span> </span>psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Wood deck:<span> </span><strong>$13,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 Dallas remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2020, a total gut renovation in Dallas that brings your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking, starts at<span> </span><strong>$80 – $100</strong><span> </span>psf for a home that has low-range finishes. This means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. Both<span> </span>Sweeten contractor Joel<span> </span>and<span> </span>Sweeten contractor Kyle, both based in Dallas, </span><span class="s1">have worked on renovations that came under this budget range. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You’ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room. </span></p>
<p><span>As a guide, Joel advises clients to tie the price of your kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of your home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value “to really cap the budget at the return on investment,” Joel said. So for a <strong>$300,000</strong> home, aim to spend between <strong>$30,000</strong> and <strong>$60,000</strong> on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project. </span></p>
<p><span>Before getting started, Kyle suggests homeowners should research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don’t end up with a low-end renovation in a high-end area or vice versus. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later.  </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2020</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s5">A Dallas kitchen renovation i<span>n the best-value range can start at <strong>$10,000</strong> and reach <strong>$15,000</strong>. A kitchen renovation in the best-value range can start at <strong>$15,000</strong>, according to Kyle. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said Joel. To keep costs down cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next step up is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.</span><br /></span><span class="s5"><br /></span></li>
<li class="li5"><span><span class="s5">A mid-range kitchen remodel in Dallas has costs starting at <strong>$25,000 – $30,000</strong>. What does a mid-range kitchen look like at this starting cost? T<span class="s1">he kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for your new one and your old sink for your new sink. </span></span><span class="s1">You can get a stainless steel sink with single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.</span></span></li>
<li class="li5"><span>For an upscale kitchen, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from <strong>$50,000</strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were for custom-made cabinets, as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. “Adding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen…” also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>There are plenty of variables in most materials, Joel said. For example, with quartz, you can spend <strong>$2,000</strong> or <strong>$7,000</strong> depending upon the quality. “It just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,” Sweeten contractor Joel advised.</span></p>
<h5><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span></h5>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2020</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">At the low-end, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at<span> </span><strong>$8,000 – $15,000</strong>.</span> These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn’t move, Kyle said. This budget won’t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the Dallas area, a mid-range bathroom can start at<span> </span><strong>$15,000 – $25,000</strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about<span> </span><strong>$20,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$570</strong><span> </span>psf, as per<span> </span><em>Remodeling</em>‘s Cost Vs Value<span> </span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The example project for this budget is a 35-square-foot bathroom. You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. More<span> </span></span>than<span> </span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55 percent of your budget</a><span> </span><span class="s1"><span>can be recouped in the value the project adds to your home.  </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p class="p1"><span><span class="s1">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. </span><span class="s2">This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5’ x 7’ space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Cost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,” said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 costs for outdoors &amp; deck remodeling in Dallas </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it’s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot summer evening</a>. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It’s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic wooden deck will likely cost<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>psf or<span> </span><strong>$13,000</strong><span> </span>for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the Cost Vs Value<span> </span><span class="s6">report</span>. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under<span> </span><strong>$19,000</strong><span> </span>for the same size or<span> </span><strong>$60</strong><span> </span>psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 Remodeling costs in Dallas: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upmarket suburb of Highland Park bases building permit costs on square footage. The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs<span> </span><strong>$490</strong>, according to Highland Park’s calculator.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the city of Addison,<a href="https://addisontexas.net/sites/default/files/fileattachments/development_services/page/10881/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s6"><span> </span>building permit fees</span></a><span> </span>start at<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>for projects under<span> </span><strong>$500</strong><span> </span>in value. Fees then increase with the project’s budget. For example, a project with a budget between<span> </span><strong>$2,000</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>$25,000</strong><span> </span>will have a base cost of<span> </span><strong>$115</strong><span> </span>with an additional<span> </span><strong>$23</strong><span> </span>per<span> </span><strong>$1,000</strong><span> </span>for estimated costs over<span> </span><strong>$2,000</strong>. That means the permit for a<span> </span><strong>$20,000</strong><span> </span>mid-range bathroom remodel will cost<span> </span><strong>$529</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees in<span> </span><span class="s6">Cedar Hill</span>, southwest of the city’s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of<span> </span><strong>$400</strong><span> </span>for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by<span> </span><strong>$.60</strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by<span> </span><strong>$.40</strong>.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639486965282"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a house in Dallas?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">If you’re planning a gut renovation (taking a home down to the studs and building it back up,) and are using budget-level finishes, expect to pay $80-100 psf in Dallas, Texas. A good rule of thumb for Dallas homeowners is to limit spending on a renovation project to 10-20% of your total home value. This helps control the budget while ensuring you’ll get maximum resale value for the renovation itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639486987456"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Dallas?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Budget-conscious Dallas homeowners should budget $15,000 and more for a simple kitchen remodel. A higher, mid-range Dallas kitchen remodel will start in the range of $25,000-$30,000; but requires a rip-and-replace (no layout changes!) Higher-end kitchen remodels in Dallas will cost $50,000 and up; for layout changes, custom work, and premium materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639487009938"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Dallas?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A simple rip-and-replace Dallas bathroom remodel will cost between $8,000 – $15,000, for a small master or guest bathroom. Mid-range bathrooms see costs increase to the $15,000-$25,000 range. Premium bathroom remodels in Dallas start around $30,000, but costs increase if you’re swapping showers or tubs out, discover hidden issues, or get specialty tilework.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Atlanta </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no denying Atlanta is a booming city. Between 2010 and 2018, Atlanta was the fourth-fastest growing city in the nation, adding a little less than 700,000 people and now sits at close to six million inhabitants. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other words, it’s a great time to put down roots in Atlanta—from restoring a bungalow in Decatur, adding to a classic Georgian-style home in Druid Hill, or </span><span class="s2">remodeling</span><span class="s1"> a loft apartment in the Old Fourth Ward. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their project, offers this guide detailing costs to remodel in Atlanta as a starting point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When embarking on a renovation, ‘How much will it cost?’ will likely be your first question. It’s notable in Atlanta that once a renovation budget reaches a couple $100,000s, building a new house instead becomes a major consideration. In this situation, you’ll need to factor in costs to tear down the existing structure and remove debris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Read on for a breakdown of typical starting costs for remodeling across Atlanta, Georgia, focusing on five categories: full home, kitchen, bathroom, outdoor spaces, and permits.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: </span><span class="s3">Starting at around <strong>$70</strong>—<strong>$100 </strong></span><span class="s2">psf </span><span class="s1">(per square foot)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$35,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$65,000</strong></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$12,500</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and reconfiguration: Starting at <strong>$35,000+</strong></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Deck</span><span class="s1"> composite: <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$61</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Wood deck: <strong>$14,000</strong> or <strong>$44</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta home remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Atlanta that brings your home down to the studs and dresses it back up again with budget</span><span class="s3"> finishes will likely start at around <strong>$70</strong> to <strong>$100</strong> psf,</span><span class="s1"> according to Atlanta-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6670#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Dexter</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He recently worked on a renovation that redid everything except for the basement. “We renovated about 85 percent of this house,” said Dexter. It was a 1950s house that involved redoing the siding, repairing, and polishing the original wood floors, remodeling two bathrooms with a custom shower in one and new tub in the other while adding gold-look faucets and an oversized kitchen island with a farmhouse sink. Subsequently, by using high-end finishes and custom elements, that renovation came in <strong>$120,000</strong> for the end budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6745#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Kimberly</a> is currently working on a 3,200 square foot farmhouse renovation. The budget is at <strong>$150,000</strong>, which includes renovating three bathrooms and expanding the fourth for a larger master suite and a kitchen remodel that includes custom kitchen cabinets and quartz countertops. “We will be making some smart choices to make it look brand spanking new without breaking the budget,” said Kimberly, adding that the owners were rolling their sleeves up to do some work themselves to reduce the budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Kimberly is about to start demolition on the project which will reveal if any rewiring is needed to bring the old building up to code. One issue common in Atlanta’s older homes is subpar work that might have been completed previously by an unlicensed contractor. “The budget could go as high as <strong>$225,000</strong>,” she said, bringing the farmhouse reno to about <strong>$75</strong> psf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, another factor that can have a big impact on a budget for an extensive renovation is the age of the house and whether it had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead paint or asbestos</a>, according to Dexter. Anything built before 1978 could have lead paint in it. Anything built between the ‘30s and the end of the ‘80s could have asbestos. That’s why Dexter gets homes built in those time periods tested. Subsequently, if it comes back positive, the removal of lead or asbestos could add a few thousand dollars to your budget while pushing your timeline back.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48249 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="740" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts--300x222.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts--600x444.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The typical quote detailing costs to remodel a minor kitchen in Atlanta ranges between <strong>$20,000</strong> to <strong>$30,000</strong> for a 200-square-foot space which</span><span class="s3"> includes labor and rough materials such as drywall</span><span class="s1">. This number doesn’t budge all that much because it is mostly calculated on installation rather than materials. </span><span class="s1">In a budget kitchen remodel, it’s a good idea to keep lighting where it is while refreshing the fixtures, according to Sweeten expert Kimberly. For a mid-grade to high-end budget, you should be able to change the location of lights. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additional material costs include elements such as replacing cabinet fronts, a basic granite countertop, basic lighting, energy-efficient appliances, faucets, and resilient flooring. For example, you could go for a good value kitchen appliance package with a dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and oven for <strong>$3,500</strong> from Home Depot. A similar package from high-end brands could set you back <strong>$20,000</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a look at some mid-grade to high-end kitchen costs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect the average mid-grade kitchen renovation to come in around <strong>$175</strong> psf or <strong>$35,000</strong> for the Atlanta area. A 200-square-feet space would reveal laminate countertops, a 15-square-foot island, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a double stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also contained a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Keeping your layout the same will be the biggest factor in keeping your budget down.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen renovations came in at around <strong>$325</strong> psf or <strong>$65,000</strong>. A 200-square-foot kitchen would include custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances were also kicked up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a typical bathroom quote, expect the cost to come in </span><span class="s3">between <strong>$12,500</strong> to <strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. The budget focuses on installation and does not include some key materials. This gives renovators the freedom to shop for what they want while having greater autonomy over their project’s budget. This cost range does include a vanity with a basic granite top, toilet, and tub or shower. Homeowners can shop for finishes such as faucets, tiles, and mirrors. For a project with a lower budget, Dexter advised renovators to stick to tiles in the <strong>$2</strong> psf range and faucets made from chrome or brushed nickel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a look at mid-grade to high-end bathroom budgets:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the Atlanta area, the average cost of a mid-grade kitchen remodel comes in about <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$571</strong> psf. This range applies to a 35-square-feet space and installing a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add about <strong>$13,000</strong> to a home’s value, which recoups close to 65 percent of the project’s cost, according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s Cost vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/"><span class="s7">report</span></a>. Not a bad investment.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A popular remodel is taking out the tubs to put in showers. However, avoiding this and working with the layout that you have can easily shave off <strong>$4,000</strong> in a bathroom budget. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">The average bathroom remodel cost in the high-end category starts at around <strong>$35,000</strong>. For this budget, you could expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to around 100 square feet and can play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You’re also likely to afford a double-sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets. In Kimberly’s experience, a high-end bathroom remodel typically involves using marble or quartz, replacing a rod and shower curtain with glass and adding elements like double shower heads.</span></li>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Costs for adding outdoor space in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you don’t mind a bit of humidity, an outdoor area can be used year-round (although, a fan and mosquito netting is a smart addition for summer). <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add or renovate your deck or patio</a> and it will be like adding another room to your home. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The average price for a 320-square-foot deck made from composite is <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$61</strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s7">report</span></a> for 2020. Composite is a mix of wood and plastic, making it more durable to weather and termites than just wood. A project using this material will add about 60 percent of the cost back into your home’s value. If you do use wood, it will reduce your budget by more than 25 percent to <strong>$14,000</strong> or <strong>$44</strong> psf. A deck made with wood will add 70 percent of the project cost to your home’s value.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Consequently, the majority of Dexter’s clients go with a wood deck rather than composite. A recent client had him rebuild a deck and cover it with flyscreen. It was about 300 square feet and the job was done for a total of <strong>$20,000</strong> or about <strong>$65</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding stone to a concrete slab for a patio will start at about <strong>$12</strong> psf, according to Kimberly. If you want to add lighting and ceiling fans, then add another <strong>$5,000</strong> to your budget for fixtures and wiring. An outdoor kitchen could range from <strong>$5,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong>. “In Atlanta, people plan spaces for entertaining purposes,” said Kimberly.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Permit costs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees are often calculated by the square footage of your project, or by the overall budget cost. To see how your area’s permits are calculated, check with your local building department. Your general contractor will likely put an estimated amount in your initial budget before a final amount is calculated. “There’s no rule of thumb when it comes to the cost of permits,” said Sweeten contractor Dexter. “Some areas I can pull a permit for <strong>$50</strong>, but the same job in another county could cost <strong>$200</strong>.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t just the cost of the actual permit that needs to go into the budget. Additionally, you also need to pay your contractors for the time it takes them to pull the permit. In some counties in Atlanta you can file electronically. Other counties, a contractor or architect will need to show up in person with paper plans, said Kimberly. A typical fee to have someone file your permits can range between <strong>$300</strong> and <strong>$1,000</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <span class="s7">cost</span> of building permits for the city of Atlanta, the area including and immediately surrounding the downtown area, is <strong>$7</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> for construction. Electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits also have their own fees, which start between <strong>$75</strong> and <strong>$175</strong> per project. Your general contractor will be familiar with the costs and will also be filing your building permits on your behalf.</span><span class="s8"> </span></p>
<p>Permits vary greatly in different areas of Atlanta. Neighborhoods like <a href="https://www.johnscreekga.gov/pdfs/cd-fee-schedule.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span aria-invalid="spelling">John&#8217;s</span> Creek</a> and Alpharetta typically have more fees to consider. Permit fees are less expensive in <a href="https://cityofsugarhill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fee_Schedule_Amendment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar Hill</a> in Gwinnett County and Forsyth County.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To confirm a budget, a general contractor will want to see the site for a more accurate assessment of costs. Having your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves” list paired with a realistic budget will have you on your way to your dream home. </span></p>

<p>Creating a budget for a renovation is unique to every project; the many variables, from your own taste for materials and quality of work to whether you are changing the layout or are moving plumbing or gas lines in a kitchen or bathroom, all factor into the equation.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has compiled a general guide to renovation costs in Fairfield County focusing on four categories—kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: <strong>$150—$350</strong> per square foot (psf)</li>

<h2>What a Connecticut home remodel cost per square foot</h2>
<p>The general range for a gut renovation in Fairfield County, CT is <strong>$150</strong> to <strong>$250 psf</strong>, according to Elizabeth, an architect in the Sweeten network. That price can easily sneak up to <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$350</strong> a square foot, she advised, depending on how complex your renovation is (structural issues, layout changes, etc.) and how expensive your tastes are in terms of fixtures and finishes. Those figures also do not include fees for architects and engineers who might be necessary throughout the course of the project.</p>
<p>Residential renovation costs have increased on average <a href="https://edzarenski.com/2018/11/16/2019-construction-economic-forecast-dec-2018e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5.7% each year</a> between 2013 and 2018. For most contractors, cost increases or decreases in all areas—labor, materials, etc—can fluctuate year to year and even throughout the year. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Oziel</a>, who works in Westchester as well as Fairfield, also pointed out that finishes—tiles, flooring, countertops, lighting, appliances, faucets, etc.—go up each year, as do overhead costs for workers compensation and general liability insurance.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry, a Sweeten contractor</a> in Fairfield County, said he tries to absorb the increases in insurance costs. He also said that while construction items go up every year, most of the increase goes to framing and electrical materials. Sweeten architect Elizabeth noted that a shrinking construction labor force in wealthy areas raises the price for skilled plumbers, electricians, and framers.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut kitchen renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.  <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has done a budget kitchen for <strong>$40,000</strong> that was 150 square feet. This budget includes semi-custom cabinets and granite or quartz countertops with no changes to the layout.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: A typical mid-grade kitchen renovation in Fairfield County is priced at <strong>$335 psf</strong>, or <strong>$67,000</strong> according to the Cost vs. Value report. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with laminate countertops, a standard sink, and faucet, with an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes a garbage disposal, custom lighting and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork. New kitchens that Elizabeth’s architectural firm has worked on usually cost between<strong> $25,000</strong> to <strong>$60,000</strong>, but it is easy to surpass that, she said.</li>
<li>High-end kitchen: For a kitchen renovation, this could mean fully custom cabinets, sourcing the best materials from overseas, and dealing with the added expense of a layout change, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfonso, a Sweeten contractor</a>. A recent kitchen renovation he worked on came to <strong>$125,000</strong>. The cabinets alone were <strong>$70,000</strong>, the countertop material was shipped in from Italy, and changing the layout of the kitchen also bumped up the cost and involved substantial plumbing and electrical work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example Alfonso used came in a little under the Cost vs Value report’s average price of a high-end kitchen of <strong>$133,000</strong> or <strong>$630 psf</strong>. This includes more expensive materials such as stone countertops, an imported tile backsplash, a water filtration system, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, plus a built-in microwave unit.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut bathroom renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathroom remodels can start at<strong> $15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. Majid has worked on projects costing <strong>$15,000</strong> for a minimum space measuring 5’ x 8’ that includes labor and rough materials. A budget of <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> is typical for a full bathroom renovation in the Fairfield area, according to Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Fairfield County, Connecticut will cost on average <strong>$21,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report which equates to <strong>$600 psf</strong> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity country, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: That same report put a high-end bathroom renovation and expansion at<strong> $66,500</strong>. The sample bathroom was expanded from 35 square feet to 100. It amounted to <strong>$665 psf</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the more expensive bathrooms Alfonso worked on came in at <strong>$88,000</strong>. This included a walk-in closet that led into the bathroom. The client wanted a custom-made European toilet, major structural changes, and marble shipped from Italy, which had a lead time of three months for delivery.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut basement renovation</h2>
<p>Basement renovations by Sweeten contractors have ranged from <strong>$30,000</strong> to<strong> $100,000</strong>. An average basement conversion across the county is <strong>$75,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report. The project for this size budget includes a 20′ x 30′ room and a 5′ x 8′ bathroom with a shower and a bar area as well as insulation and laminate flooring, which comes to <strong>$117 psf</strong>.</p>
<p>The elements that tend to inflate the budget include adding a toilet or a shower and work needed to bring the room up to code. Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (so adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor.</p>
<h2>Costs for permits</h2>
<p>Each town in Fairfield County has its own table of fees for building permits. Building permits, including those for plumbing and electrical, can cost anywhere from <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$2,500</strong> per project. The variation is often tied to your budget. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Stamford, your building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each $1,000 in your budget. That permit will cover your electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work.</li>
<li>In Westport, the permit fee for demolition is <strong>$2</strong> per 100 cubic feet of volume while the building fee is <strong>$10</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> of the renovation budget.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.greenwichct.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8484/FEES-2018-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenwich</a>, a building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> in your budget. The electrical permit fee is <strong>$12</strong> per <strong>$1,00</strong>0 of the cost of the project; this fee is the same for a plumbing permit fees.</li>
<li>Over in <a href="https://www.norwalkct.org/128/Fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norwalk</a>, building fees are structured slightly different. A building permit costs <strong>$13</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> of estimated work, which includes some electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work. However, if there are major changes in these areas, then separate permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC might be required at a cost of <strong>$13.26</strong> for every<strong> $1,000</strong> budgeted in those areas. Check the building department in your local township for a better idea of permitting costs for your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues you may or may not encounter along the way such as structural problems that need fixing or bringing a staircase up to current code could also manipulate your end budget. Take into consideration wet areas like kitchens or bathrooms cost more to renovate than dry spaces (for example, dining rooms and bedrooms) due to materials and labor that may be more complex, Alfonso says.</p>
<p>Hopefully, all of these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget. Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist offers you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a downloadable roadmap to organize</a> all of the moving parts of a renovation including laying out your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are pretty good that you’ve painted your walls before. Interior painting is a project that many are willing to tackle solo, and the prospect of a DIY job can be tempting given that the outlay is just the cost of paint and some inexpensive tools. But going pro is often the right choice, with real costs and real benefits, especially when painting is part of a more ambitious home renovation. Let’s take a look at why there are such wide variations in cost, and how to decide who is right for the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br /></a><b>Costs for painting by the gallon &amp; necessary equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many options for paint, but tried and true staples such as <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.behr.com/consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behr</a>, <a href="https://www.askval.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valspar</a>, and <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherwin Williams</a> are all available at your local hardware store or a big box store like Home Depot or Lowe’s. By the gallon, these brands rarely exceed $50 and usually average around $30, depending on the specifics. You can also go upscale with a luxury paint like Farrow &amp; Ball, where a gallon will run you $100, or <a href="https://www.finepaintsofeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine Paints of Europe</a>, at approximately $110 a gallon. Additionally, you’ll probably need to pay for primer, which averages around the same cost as paint. The rest of the supplies—rollers, extenders, brushes, trays/pans, and paper or tarp—will represent a small percentage of your total budget. For example, a brush costs a few dollars at any local hardware store, and a 36” x 900’ roll of brown paper costs $39 at Home Depot (enough for a very large paint job.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Variables that&#8217;ll impact costs to paint a home&#8217;s interior </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s where it gets more complicated: like most other types of renovation work, painting is very site-specific. This means that all the charming idiosyncrasies of your prewar apartment (e.g., the crown moldings, prized paneling, that curved hallway wall) translate into higher painting costs. Many experts will refuse to provide a bid without a site visit, and with good reason. They need to make a visual assessment of the condition of the walls and surroundings before providing a competitive estimate. They will want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What condition are the walls in and how much prep will be required?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How high are the ceilings, what are the specific dimensions of the surfaces, and how much trim detail is there?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the quality of work in the rest of the apartment? (This helps them assess where to land on the spectrum of “rental grade” to “luxury” in terms of the finished product.)</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there furniture to work around? How much of it?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there lead present in the existing paint?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the building restrictions on construction work?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is the site?</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Painters use all of this information to assess how many labor hours the job will require. For example, they take into account how much commuting time will be required, and how long a day they will be allowed to work. They think about whether they’ll have to circle the block and monitor a meter, or if they can just park in your driveway. And, they note how much prep will be necessary, in addition to the actual painting time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One other variable to keep in mind is that small projects tend to offer less bang for your buck because there is some time that elapses between steps. For example, if your project is limited to one bedroom, there isn’t anything else the workers can do while they are waiting for the primer to dry, whereas if your project includes more rooms, they can alternate working in different spaces. For a small project, you end up paying for the whole day anyway, because waiting becomes part of the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Labor costs for painting </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, painters are often willing to provide their per-hour rate to clients, unlike general contractors or millworkers, whose projects are not as easily broken down into an hourly rate. This means that once you know the per-hour rate that your painter charges, and how many hours the job will take, there is very little mystery to how your project will be billed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While hourly labor rates do vary, they typically start at about $25 to $30 per hour on the low end and average around $50 to $60 per hour for an experienced painter (not a huge range.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Preparation before interior painting walls</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real disparity in painting costs arise because of the amount of time spent on prep. Prep work is what makes the difference between a rental-grade finished product and a high-end, luxury one. Perfectly smooth walls and incisive clean lines are difficult (and thus expensive) to come by, so it is often just a question of how much imperfection a homeowner is willing to live with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one painter provides a $5,000 bid for a project while another painter bids $3,000, most of the difference will be in the amount of prep. The higher bid will probably involve carefully “raking” the walls (a process that involves darkening the room and using a small spotlight to highlight problem spots), systematically repairing all the spots, applying and sanding down compound, and then a thorough cleaning of all the surfaces to ensure maximum paint adhesion. The lower bid will likely skip over some of these steps to reduce labor hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, detail work takes a lot of prep. Taping and prep steps double as soon as you introduce a line of molding in a contrasting color, and trim details are critical focal points so your design choices and architectural details will come into play in determining project timeline and cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many renovators have also wondered about skim-coating, a particularly time-intensive (and thus costly) aspect of prep work. Skim-coating is a process in which you smooth out the wall by rolling thinned-out, all-purpose joint compound (“mud”) on the walls, and then immediately smooth it out with a knife edge. Because the mud dries quickly, it can only be applied in small patches. And each layer is thin, so it may require multiple layers to even out very bumpy or textured walls. Although it sounds relatively simple, it requires skill and experience to do well. As a result, skim-coating is billed separately, and at a higher rate (roughly $10 to $20 more expensive than painting by the hour), and will also take more time than the painting itself. That combination of a higher hourly rate and more time needed for skim-coating can easily double the cost of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Skim-coating is a big undertaking. If you’re on the fence about whether your walls need it, you might compromise by focusing on areas that are well lit (where defects are easy to see) or in rooms that you plan to paint with a gloss or semi-gloss paint (these finishes tend to magnify imperfections). You might decide that a very visible wall that gets lots of natural light needs the full treatment, while walls that aren’t quite as prominent or immediately visible upon entry get a bit less focus. Pause in each room and think about where your eye hits when you walk in and out and when you are naturally using the room. You may find that only one out of four walls really needs the re-surfacing that skim-coating provides.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And lastly, if there is lead paint detected in your home, there are additional steps that workers must take to contain dust. Painters will need to ensure special staging of the work site with plastic tarp, and use special vacuums that do not recirculate dust into the air. Again, more time spent prepping equals more money.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review surfaces and walls before beginning to paint </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a homeowner, you can start by assessing the condition and complexity of the space, and think through how much prep and perfection you want to include in your budget. An empty room with walls in decent condition might just need one to two painters over one to two days of work to get a fresh coat up, whereas an entire home with varied surfaces and heavy furniture will require a full team working over the course of two weeks or more to prep, paint, and finish across a variety of spaces.</p>
