			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to create and use <span>a </span>scope of work when undertaking a home remodeling project</span></h2>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11.jpg" alt="kitchen with white waterfall island" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45705" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

Photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></p>
<h3>Why is the scope of work important?</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Scope of work” or &#8220;scope&#8221; is construction lingo for the list of work that needs to be done in a remodeling project. When a contractor asks for <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your project scope</a>, they’re really asking, “What are all the things you need me to do?” Sweeten breaks it all down below.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the scope of work?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Early in your planning, like when you first post your project on the Sweeten platform or start talking to general contractors, your scope will likely be vague. For example, “I want to renovate the master bathroom, including retiling and replacing cabinets and fixtures.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Later, when it comes time to ask general contractors for estimates, you’ll work with them to fill in the details. These important details make up the scope of work! The details will cover the exact work that needs to be done, including materials and fixture specifics, and plans drawn for any changes to the layout, pipes, or wiring (see “Renovation scope of work example” below). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All the specifics need to be in writing by the time you ask for a contract. Once you’ve signed, additional changes to the scope of work are considered “change orders,” and will bring additional costs.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Finessing your budget and scope of work</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Often, you won’t be able to move from a general to specific scope until you know the cost of all the options. We suggest making a list of everything you want, divided into <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“must-haves” and “nice-to-haves.”</a> Your general contractor can help you decide on a specific scope that fits your budget, including as many “nice-to-haves” as possible. </span></p>
<h4>My scope exceeds my budget. Now what?</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your contractor makes <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/can-i-ask-my-contractor-for-a-revised-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an estimate that exceeds your budget</a>, it’s time to negotiate. Please don’t just ask for a discount. General contractors operate on very low margins; you’d be asking them to lose money. Instead, ask questions about how to adjust the scope to fit your budget. You might get some surprising and imaginative ideas. Sweeten general contractors are often wizards at this kind of creative problem-solving to make potential clients happy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A remodeling rule-of-thumb: The more rigid your budget, the more flexible your scope should be. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">If a scope of work isn’t possible</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Occasionally a general contractor will tell you that something in your scope is impossible. This can be disappointing—but we promise, they’re not just being difficult. Sometimes there will be structural reasons that something can’t be done. Other times there will be strict national or local building codes that have to be obeyed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pro tip: Always ask why something in the scope can’t be done. You might start a conversation with your contractor that leads to ideas that are just as satisfying as the original.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Prep scopes before the estimate</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You might want to consider more than one scope. For example, one version might be a kitchen remodel that includes changing the floor plan and opening a wall. Another version could be a simple rip-and-replace of the existing cabinets and finishes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s fine to present these alternate versions to your general contractor, as long as you do so before asking them to create any estimates. And you should keep it to just two variations. Beyond two, your contractor might ask for an additional deposit—because drawing up detailed estimates is time-consuming work.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Example of a scope of work in construction</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace toilet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace vanity cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Change out sink<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Retile floor<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Relocate shower—see plans<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Install cement board<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Tile shower/tub surround<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace light fixture<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Add outlets—see plans<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Paint walls and ceiling</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The scope of work, in summary</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Start with a general scope, with your must-haves and nice-to-haves. Moving on to your final, detailed scope requires negotiating many variables. Your Sweeten general contractor can be a valuable resource in this process. Be sure to communicate clearly, ask questions, and give as much information as possible before requesting a bid. And remember: the details in a contract finalize your scope. Any additions to the scope after you’ve signed the contract will be considered a change order, which might push you over budget.</span></p>

			<h3 class="p1">Yes, it <em>is</em> possible to live through a kitchen remodel, with a few key remodeling tips in hand</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1.jpg" alt="Kitchen in the middle of a renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52709" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Remodeling your kitchen is a smart move and you’ll be pleased that you took the leap and did it. However, for a short time during the project, you might feel some&#8230;frustration, especially if you are accustomed to being at home most days.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s all manageable, however, and you’ll do fine if you know what to expect. It’s all about adaptability and making as many choices proactively as possible. Get things set up before it feels like an emergency. You’ll be inconvenienced for several weeks or so, if the project goes as planned. Sweeten outlines how to live through a kitchen remodel below.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Set up a temporary kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1">Naturally, you’ll have to feed the family and clean up after meals and snacks, so you’ll need some sort of temporary kitchen. If you have room for a temporary kitchen, old dismantled kitchen cabinets could create a makeshift mini-kitchen space. Even some of the old countertop could be used.</p>
<p class="p1">If you don’t have an extra room, where can you carve out some space for, say, 2–4 weeks? You might use the patio/deck and grill for a lot of cooking and the default dining table, if the weather cooperates.</p>
<p class="p1">Moving the refrigerator to a space where it’s still usable is typically mandatory. Go over changes like these with the contractor so you don’t block a space they’ll need to access.</p>
<p class="p1">You might wonder if the fridge can move to the deck or patio, and it’s possible, but it&#8217;ll depend on the weather. Refrigerators have an ambient operating temperature range, and if the outdoor temperature goes below ~40 degrees, the compressor won’t run. If the compressor doesn’t run, then the freezer won’t work. Likewise, avoid setting a refrigerator in full sun. The heat will force the compressor to work much harder and more often, which will shorten its life.</p>
<h4>Cooking without a normal kitchen</h4>
<p class="p1">Cooking is really pretty easy. You can use a camp stove, toaster oven, microwave oven, instant pot, and/or grill for numerous meals. You probably can’t move and use your freestanding range, as they require a 240v outlet and dedicated circuit for power.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Staying at home during a kitchen remodel</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are accustomed to being at home quite a bit, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of construction might unnerve you</a>. Naptime for the kids will be tough to keep going, as will any work duties you plan to accomplish. Going to the office a bit more may turn into an attractive option, along with coffee shops and shared office spaces.</p>
<p class="p1">Do the daily work hours work for you? Tradespeople often start early and their work is often noisy. If you like to sleep in, you will probably chafe at having workers at the house early in the morning, but that’s what it takes—temporarily.</p>
<p class="p1">Talk with your contractor about the daily schedule to set shared expectations. Surprises happen and everyone has to roll with them. An organized and professional contractor will set you up as well as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Living in a hotel during the remodel</h3>
<p class="p1">Another option that has unique benefits is staying at a hotel. You can choose a standard stay or an extended-stay suite, which may even have a mini-kitchen. These offer clear and compelling advantages: low commitment and high flexibility, as in booking and leaving with little notice.</p>
<p class="p1">Cost may seem high but it may be well worth it to avoid the chaos of living in a remodeling zone. You will have to live somewhere during the work, so a hotel could be just part of the project budget.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Create a contingency plan to cover surprises</h3>
<p class="p1">Finally, have a contingency budget plan of 10-15% if something goes awry. The worst-case scenario would be something like discovering asbestos or mold, which must be professionally remediated. Those professionals are specialty crews, not your contractor or subcontractors. That could stop other work until they are done. There’s no good way to estimate how long that work could take, but your general contractor will know how to find the experts and rearrange the schedule and sequencing.</p>
<p class="p1">Other common scenarios are occasional shortages of materials or <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistakes in ordering or fulfillment</a>. Special-order items, for example, can be subject to delays. Luckily, a good contractor can peruse your plan and spot potential bottlenecks quickly, but it’s good to be prepared.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a lot to consider for a kitchen remodel, but the hassle is temporary and the benefit is long term. With preparation and a flexible mindset, you’ll be on the way to your dream kitchen.</p>

			<h2>The punch list is a final, crucial step of a renovation. Here&#8217;s how they work.</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Kitchen island with white countertops and seating for two" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52014" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

Photo by Kate Glicksberg for Sweeten.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A punch list is a list of tasks put together by a homeowner that needs to be completed by their contractor. </span><span class="s2">The punch list needs to be done for the project to be completely done. The majority of the work has been finished, but there are details to be resolved. You have one shot to compile your punch list, and once it is completed, the project is officially done!</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">What goes on a punch list?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It depends who you ask! This question is often a misunderstanding between a homeowner and a contractor. In construction, there are acceptable quality standards, which are in the form of building codes. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Licensed contractors are responsible</a> for abiding by these codes. When a project passes inspection by the codes enforcement official, some contractors consider their work completed. Building codes exist to ensure an acceptable level of quality and ensure that the home is structurally sound. Reputable general contractors will not only meet, but exceed this benchmark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of a punch list is to address concerns the homeowner may have after inspecting a project. For example, a crooked hinge on a kitchen cabinet door would normally indicate a defect and should appear on your list. Clashing paint colors, however, are usually not the responsibility of the painter, and would not indicate a defect. Even so, the situation needs correcting. Add these concerns to your punch list. You and your contractor will discuss if the task will be fixed by them or the subcontractor. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How do I start a punch list?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To start a punch list, the easiest way is to have paper and pencil in each room. Notes stay organized and prevent several lists from being created for the same room. Many new homeowners prefer to live in the space for a while. They can relax and use the space in a daily routine. This makes identifying any issues easier. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">When does a rolling punch list happen?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditionally, final payment is paid to the contractor at project completion. A walk-through and a punch list happen after the final payment. As any concerns are addressed, the general contractor will often either discuss the concern or agree to correct the issue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An alternative punch list solution is referred to as a &#8220;rolling punch list&#8221;, or a punch list-as-you-go. Instead of inspecting all of the details at the end, the general contractor makes periodic walk-throughs with the homeowner. As concerns are addressed, everyone involved takes a role in resolving the issue. If the subcontractor is still onsite with labor, machines, and materials, it is easier to correct a concern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before a project starts, the homeowner and contractor should confirm when the punch list will take place. Each general contractor has their own process for handling punch list items. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">What is the difference between a tweak and a defect?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This question is really at the heart of a punch list. During installation, an issue such as a crooked cabinet hinge will raise concerns immediately for a homeowner. Contractors tend to focus on completing the project even if small adjustments will be required later on. A homeowner may view the crooked cabinet door as a lack of skill or professional ethics.</span><span class="s1"> Have an open dialog between the general contractor and homeowner, so both parties can ask questions and set realistic expectations. Ideally, this discussion will be frequent and ongoing throughout the project so that confusion and assumptions are kept to a minimum.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are working with a Sweeten contractor, a homeowner may also reach out to Sweeten customer support with questions or clarifications. Email ClientServices@sweeten.com.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Be communicative and flexible</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A punch list should be considered a place to answer questions and get questions answered. For the experienced contractor, the positive completion of a punch list is their business card. For a homeowner, it can confirm they are working with a professional.</span></p>
<h3>Finding a true partner in your general contractor</h3>
<p><span class="s1">At Sweeten, we appreciate the value of working with the right general contractor<span>—one </span>who understands your vision, comes up with solutions to challenges, involves you in decision-making, and communicates clearly. If you&#8217;re looking for an expert contractor near you, look no further!

<p><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">When do you need permits to remodel a bathroom?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to understand why homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose to remodel their bathrooms</a> making it one of the most popular home renovation projects. We demand a lot from our bathrooms! In turn, upgrading to space-efficient tubs, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovators-converted-tubs-to-showers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub-to-shower conversions</a>, faucets, and toilets make daily life better. Building codes, however, dictate how far you can go with changes before requiring a permit. Here, we answer a common question on homeowners&#8217; minds: Do you need permits to remodel a bathroom?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The short answer is, to start the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of upgrading your bathroom</a>, you usually need permits. When you make changes to plumbing, electrical, or structural components of your home, you need a permit from the Department of Buildings. However, small aesthetic changes, like painting rooms, repairing plaster, or refinishing floors do not require a permit. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s2">Bathroom remodeling permits for: Minor plumbing projects</span><span class="s1"> </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can make minor plumbing changes without a permit for a bathroom remodel. However, requirements vary between cities and counties across the country. For example, according to the New York City <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/property-or-business-owner/plumbing-permits.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">Department of Buildings</span></a>: </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Simple repairs or direct replacement of existing faucets or fixtures such as toilets and sinks are considered cosmetic work and do not require a permit. Direct replacement involves work that does not alter or change the fixture&#8217;s hot and cold water shutoff valves or fixture trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So for plumbing, leave the valves and trap alone when you replace a faucet and you don’t need a permit. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s2">Bathroom remodeling permits for: </span><span class="s2">Minor electrical projects</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In contrast, minor electrical work in a bathroom remodel usually requires a permit. According to the DOB again:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">“An electrical permit is required for most electrical work, including handling of electrical wires that is performed in a residential home or business.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, you can do simple repairs and fixture replacement without a permit for plumbing, but not for electrical work. Beyond that, it’s considered remodeling; so you’ll be dealing with permits, professionals, and more complexity. Don’t worry, though, as it’s a clear<span>—</span>if slow<span>—</span>process. The secret is to work with professionals who know what they’re doing. We can connect you with vetted and licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors who are up-to-date with local code and regulations. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Building codes by county</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other places in the U.S., you’ll have to research your local requirements for bathroom remodeling permits. You’ll find counties that have not adopted a specific building code but do require a permit and inspection for some types of work, like septic systems, plumbing, and electrical. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This scenario can be somewhat opaque, so do preliminary research on local building websites before talking with your contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, updates to these regulations don’t happen regularly on their websites</span><span class="s1">, and that holds true for official websites, too. Therefore, you’ll get the latest information from the people who deal with these issues regularly<span>—general contractors</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten general contractor helped Ashleigh and Jonathan navigate their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/washer-dryer-bathroom-renovation-dumbo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom permits</a> on a tight timeline.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Navigating bathroom remodel permits</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Filing permits for a bathroom remodel </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For our purposes here, bathroom remodeling involves a new bathtub and/or shower, new toilet, and new sink, which may be freestanding or in cabinetry. It is common for many partial to full renovations to start with simple changes, like a new faucet or new flooring. The scope then grows when people realize they really dislike that bathroom and they don’t need to live with it any longer. As a result, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget for the project</a> and permit fees need to be adjusted. In Sweeten homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/apartment-bathroom-remodel-in-hoboken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda and Bob&#8217;s bathroom remodel</a>, their plumbing stayed in the same places but they did add a second sink. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With any remodeling project, you should create a plan. This is where you decide <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who to hire for your renovation team</a>. For a project with any layout changes, whether they&#8217;re plumbing or electrical changes or not, you’ll need to work with a registered architect or a professional engineer. Those pros are referred to as the Registered Design Professional. They will file the permit application as the Applicant of Record with the <span class="s3">Department of Buildings</span> and ensure that the project meets requirements. You’ll need patience for this, as it’s common for your permit application to take 2-6 months for approval. It could take longer, depending on the extent of work and the building. Historic buildings add another layer of complexity. </span></p>
<h4>Working with home associations &amp; condos</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners/condo/building associations may have a policy that requires an alteration agreement for work on your home. Moving forward will require paperwork to be submitted and approved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those associations usually have extensive oversight of the building and will review and approve or deny your plans. They may have their own architect or other experts review your plan. They’ll also want to confirm your insurance coverage and make sure you have a licensed contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, you may not be allowed to make major layout changes. Most building designs have “wet” spaces with plumbing “stacked” from floor to floor. For instance, a toilet drain will not be located above your downstairs neighbor’s bedroom. The plumbing system is also vented, and is typically constructed as a system within the entire building. Subsequently, any modifications must work within that system. Again, your architect or contractor should advise on what’s possible. Work with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted, licensed general contractor</a> to avoid headaches (and a lot of back-and-forth.)</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind-the-scenes in a bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A licensed contractor should handle the remodeling work in your bathroom. They will have the professional contacts for subcontractors in the plumbing and electrical field. These professionals handle tasks like wiring, laying and grouting tile, and more. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The extent of work involved varies dramatically depending on the condition and layout of your home compared to what you want to achieve. The easiest changes involve the sink and faucet. Even with some plumbing changes, you’re not looking at tearing up a lot of the room and rebuilding. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Changing the location of the toilet, bathtub, or shower becomes much more complicated. Supply lines for water run through the walls or the floor/ceiling, but drains have to fit into the floor space and then join the plumbing “stack” in the wall. This is the combination drain and vent system. Changes to these parts can involve a lot of destruction before anything new can be installed. Bidets<span>—</span>an increasingly popular addition in recent years<span>—</span>will need a drain and supply lines. This type of work is routine for a seasoned plumber but definitely must be done with care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the toilet, replacing an existing bathtub can be hard work, but is typically straightforward if you&#8217;re able to reuse the existing drain and supply lines. Changing from a bathtub to a tub/shower or to a walk-in shower becomes slightly more complex, but not substantially. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where to start a bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to renovate your bathroom, be sure to find the right general contractor who understands your vision<span>—and can build the type of bathroom you want</span>. During a site visit, they&#8217;ll help you discover ideal design features for your space, and will be invaluable in assisting with the permit process. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with Sweeten to renovate</a><span class="s2"> with the best contractors</span>.</span></p>

			<h2>Yes, revised estimates are possible, but be ready to compromise and collaborate</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-doors" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg" alt="Living room with doors and room view before renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51371" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve received a remodeling estimate from your Sweeten general contractor. What if the total exceeds your budget—can you ask for a revised estimate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short answer: Yes, with limitations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>When can I ask for a lower or revised renovation estimate?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can generally expect a single round of minor revisions for free. If you need major scope changes or multiple versions of the estimate, expect your contractor to ask for money up-front. This is because calculating estimates requires substantial work. If you hire the contractor, this fee will typically be treated as a deposit and will count toward the total renovation cost. You won’t be out-of-pocket unless you ask a contractor for extensive revisions and then decline to hire them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What revisions are considered minor? Minor revisions involve eliminating part of the project or making simple substitutions (switching from custom imported tiles to standard subway tiles, etc.).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you negotiate for a lower price, you must always think in terms of reduced scope or lower-priced materials. Don’t just ask for a discount! General contractors don’t leave room for discounts in their estimates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely ask your contractor for advice on how to meet a lower budget. Their experience can be invaluable in strategizing where to cut costs<span>—</span>and where not to. </span></p>
<h3>Ballpark quote vs. formal remodeling estimate</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind the difference between a contractor’s initial ballpark quote and their formal estimate. That first quote may be based on your posted Sweeten project and a brief conversation. The formal estimate will come after a site visit, a longer discussion, and hours of behind-the-scenes research and calculation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you receive your initial quote, this is the time to discuss your budget limits and to be clear about your must-haves vs. your nice-to-haves. Giving your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor the important information up-front</a> will help you avoid major revisions entirely.</span></p>
<h3>Do:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discuss your scope and budget with your contractor before they draft an estimate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your site visit, feel free to postpone requesting an estimate. If you need time to think about your budget, ask for it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your contractor for advice on reducing the scope to meet your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to pay for major estimate revisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to wait a few days for major estimate revisions</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Don’t:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a discount without a change in scope or materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a formal estimate before you’re clear on your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions for free</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions quickly</span></li>

			<h2>Providing deposits for contractors is a crucial<span>—and normal—step in starting a renovation</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="room-ready-for-renovation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg" alt="Image of room ready for renovation" width="1000" height="665" class="alignnone wp-image-51631 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Short answer: Yes. </span><span class="s1">But there are exceptions, and your contractor may have some flexibility. Below, Sweeten outlines the reasons behind upfront payment amounts, and some options for negotiating your deposit for a contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do contractors require a deposit?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deposits for contractors are critical because they essentially allow your project to begin! Your general contractor needs to secure a crew and begin <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordering materials right away</a>. They may also need to rent equipment. And your contractor can’t take on all the financial liability for these commitments themself.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much of a deposit can a contractor ask for? </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exact deposit amount contractors ask for upfront varies and is especially dependent on the size of the project. For relatively small jobs, like a $16,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/">bathroom remodel</a>, contractors may ask for a 50% deposit. For large jobs, like a $100,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/">full-home renovation</a>, a 10%–20% deposit is more typical. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Is the deposit for a contractor negotiable?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be. In many cases, contractors start with a standardized contract, so some of the terms could be based on a typical job rather than the specifics of yours. You may be able to ask for somewhat lower initial payment or deposit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal time to ask is during negotiations (—an important part of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">the contractor hiring process</a>), before the contractor drafts the contract. But they may be amenable to a minor contract alteration after the fact. Just know that their flexibility may be limited. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What about the remaining payments?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General contractors use a number of different fee structures. The payment schedule might be based on fixed dates, or on major project milestones. For small jobs, they’ll typically ask for just two payments—one upfront, the other at the end. For larger projects, there may be as many as five scheduled payments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most contractors ask for the final payment upon “substantial completion.” This means that everything’s complete except the punch list*, and possibly final work on minor finishes. Occasionally, a contractor will consider a job substantially complete when there’s a single large outstanding item—like an expensive fixture that’s held up by a shipping delay, but which won’t require much labor to install. When you&#8217;re ready to begin your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/">find a vetted and experienced contractor</a>. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">*The punch list is a tally of any minor problems for the contractor to fix—like a paint splatter, a missing drawer pull, a misaligned cabinet hinge, etc.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Points to remember for contractor deposits:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a deposit for a contractor before work can begin<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a higher percentage on a smaller job, and vice-versa<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Discuss the contractors&#8217; deposit and payment schedule before they draft the contract<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If you’d like to amend the contract, don’t expect the contractor to have unlimited flexibility<br />
</span></li>
</ul>

			<h2 class="p1">Want to start a kitchen remodel successfully? Start by gathering details and staying flexible</h2>

<p class="p1">Statistically speaking, kitchens are the most remodeled room in a home. This is due to many factors, not the least of which is that few things date a home faster than a kitchen design. Kitchens tend to last a long time. Whether this is your forever home or you plan to move in a few years, you can choose to personalize your kitchen or give it a classic design. Below, Sweeten outlines how to start a kitchen remodel and how the pros put everything back together.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">How to start a kitchen remodel: Gather information</h3>
<p class="p1">To answer that question, you’ll need to answer a few others first. Here are a few:</p>
<h4>Are you DIY-ing your kitchen?</h4>
<p class="p1">To answer the first question, consider not just the money you’ll need, but the time as well. For example, you may have the skills to do some or all of the work yourself. Many homeowners will perform fairly low-skill projects, such as painting and caulking to save money. More experienced do-it-yourselfers can also install trim, insulation, and even floor coverings. However, these projects will take a while, so make sure you have the time to complete them. (We recommend reading about <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/the-cons-of-diy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cons of DIY in home renovation.</a>)</p>
<p class="p1">A very common mistake of first-time remodelers is underestimating the time needed to finish a renovation. If you plan to do some of the work yourself, make sure you can complete the project in a timely manner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> For example, i</span>f you hire contractors, you don’t want to delay them because you didn&#8217;t finish your project in a weekend.</p>
<h4>How will you communicate with contractors?</h4>
<p>If you plan to use contractors, will you be available to answer questions during the day? A good solution is to set up a window of time for communication. For example, make yourself available for a couple of hours each morning to discuss the events of the following day. That way your contractor can meet with you once, instead of playing phone tag throughout the day.</p>
<h4>What part of your kitchen remodel is the most important?</h4>
<p class="p1">This question is probably the most important because it really doesn’t matter how much your project costs, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how long it takes</a> if you don&#8217;t like the end result. For instance, in a kitchen remodel, you’ll likely spend most of your budget on the cabinets and the countertops. (Note: this excludes appliances if you plan to replace those as well). Cabinets and counters are typically the first things you see when you enter a kitchen, so most owners want to make a good impression. Know what you care about the most and make sure it&#8217;s covered in your budget.</p>
<h5>&#8220;Must-haves&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Nice-to-haves&#8221;</h5>
<p class="p1">A great way to stay on track and keep your costs under control is to make two lists. The first should list all of the renovation “must-haves” that are the most important to you. These items are non-negotiable and must be included. The second list will include any “nice-to-have” features. These are things you would like to include if you have the resources available, but not at the expense of your &#8220;must-have&#8221; list.</p>
<h4>Why are you remodeling your kitchen?</h4>
<p class="p1">Lastly, ask yourself why you want to remodel the space. It may seem like a silly question, but one thing many homeowners fear is over-remodeling. To illustrate, if you plan to live in a home forever, buying exotic wood cabinets or installing customized materials can be very satisfying. However, if you plan to sell the home for a profit in the near future, installing those features could actually lower your home’s value by comparison if few other comparable homes have them as well. A potential buyer may be able to afford your neighborhood, but not share your same taste. They may place very little value on your personalized choice, which affects your return on investment.</p>
<p class="p1">Avoid this scenario by deciding upfront what your end goal is and act accordingly. There is nothing wrong with personalizing your home, but it may be useful to know in advance which features will have a good return on the investment and which will not. Asking this one question will often save renovating homeowners thousands of dollars.</p>
<h3 class="p3">What happens if you&#8217;re gutting a kitchen?</h3>
<p class="p1">Generally speaking, in a gut remodel, everything will be removed down to the wall studs. This allows for inspection of the wall cavities and the installation of any fixtures, like a pot filler, while all of the pipes are still accessible. Any new features, such as a window, are also framed at this stage.</p>
<p class="p1">Renovations can also be done in phases. For example, it is often convenient to replace light fixtures or add ceiling-mounted speakers before removing cabinets and flooring. As we tend to need our kitchens during a renovation, performing the project in phases can be a welcome option.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Remodel Your Kitchen In the Correct Order and Save Money</h3>
<h4>Staying code compliant</h4>
<p class="p1">So now that you have an empty room, what do you do? After gaining access to the wall studs, any insulation, framing, electrical, or plumbing work can be done. If your project will be built in a jurisdiction with code requirements, there will usually be an inspection made by a local codes official to ensure compliance. Any required inspections will need to be made and passed before installing new drywall. An experienced and licensed general contractor will know the code requirements for your municipality and will be responsible for adhering to them. After any new features are installed, inspected, and approved the drywall is then replaced and finished.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Paint and lighting</h4>
<p class="p1">In many situations, the next step is to paint. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the pros will usually spray on paint, because it is super fast when the room is empty. This prevents the need to stand on a step ladder for hours on end painting around light fixtures and wall switches, saving you money.</p>
<p class="p1">Professionals will often install the light fixtures next. Again, this may seem odd, but wall sconces and overhead fixtures need to be in an open space to distribute the light, keeping them out of the way of other projects. Contractors often work in low lighting, because during the beginning phase the space is essentially bare. By installing the lighting first, the need for pole lights and other portable lighting is reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that the kitchen is painted and well lit, the cabinets are usually installed, followed by the countertops, and finally, the sink. As mentioned earlier, you may also be adding new plumbing fixtures such as a bar sink, or pot filler. These would be installed at this stage, as well as new features such as GFCI outlets or a hot water recirculation pump.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Lay flooring down last</h4>
<p class="p1">Floor covering such as vinyl or cork can be damaged easily during a remodel. Even <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/qa-with-joy-moyler-design-tips-on-trends-and-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">durable materials such as porcelain tiles</a> can be broken by a falling tool. Hardwood floors are especially vulnerable, as repairs often involve removing large sections. For this reason, professionals will usually install floor coverings last. This also prevents wasting materials in areas that will never be walked on, such as under cabinetry. At this stage, any trim required, such as the baseboard or casing can be replaced.</p>
<h3>Ready to get started?</h3>
<p class="p1">Remodeling a kitchen can be the most rewarding project a homeowner can take on. It&#8217;ll likely pay off with prospective buyers, too, since the kitchen is often considered the most important room in a home. Knowing how to start a kitchen remodel can be simple if you&#8217;re prepared with the right details. Remember to do your homework, ask your contractor lots of questions, and stay involved in the process.</p>

<p class="p3">The character of Philadelphia is <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/history-of-american-row-houses-8600298c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined by its rowhouse streetscapes</a>. Rowhouses are space-efficient, compact, and often cost-effective. Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse comes with its share of joys and challenges. Sweeten lays out what you can expect with renovating these historic buildings.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/pa/philadelphia-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">What is a rowhouse in Philadelphia?</h3>
<p class="p3">A Philadelphia rowhouse is an urban one-to-four-story house that has a narrow front exterior. Rowhouses are attached to similar rowhouses on both sides.</p>
<p class="p3">Philadelphia has more rowhouses than any other type of housing structure. Designed as an inexpensive way to house Philadelphia’s rapidly growing industrial population, rowhouses have become desired, premium properties.</p>
<p class="p3">Some Philly rowhouses are quite large. Rittenhouse Square mansions can be as huge as 3,000 to 6,000 square feet. Most Philadelphia rowhouses are small to moderate in size, though. Trinities and Bandboxes (smaller versions of Trinities) can be as tiny as 400 to 600 square feet. Two-story rowhouses in Center City, South and North Philadelphia, and Manayunk can range from 1,000 to 1,600 square feet.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse: Challenges and solutions</h3>
<p class="p3">Because Philly rowhouses are unique, renovating them can present challenges. But to an experienced contractor, solving these issues is just a part of the daily work of creativity and flexibility.</p>
<p class="p3">Philly-area-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6753#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor <span class="s1">John</span></a> calls his approach “bob and weave,” after a boxer’s split-second, nimble approach to punches that come their way. “Rowhouses don’t always need to be more difficult,” said John, “because we try to be flexible.”</p>
<p class="p3">John cites his approach to debris removal as an example. It’s no problem to park rolloff dumpsters in the driveway of a suburban single-family detached house; you just do it. But when a dumpster needs to be parked on a public street, all sorts of permitting issues arise.</p>
<p class="p3">John’s solution is to cycle out debris every day. “A hauling company picks up the daily load and some of my guys have trucks, too, so they can move debris.”</p>
<p class="p3">Narrow doorways are obstacles to moving in building materials and appliances. Sometimes the old 30-inch doorways have been widened already. When they haven’t, John calls this one of his biggest problems with rowhouse remodels. But he can always find workarounds by temporarily removing door trim or by unboxing appliances.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Ways to increase square footage in rowhouses</h3>
<p class="p3">Squeezed in on both sides, the average rowhouse is fairly small. So, remodels need to be creative. Some contractors build soffits (or bulkheads) over exposed pipes, wires, and vents. However, doing this reduces space. “We like to avoid building soffits,” say<span class="s1">s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6510#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Mario</a>, who is based in Philadelphia</span>, “and most homeowners don’t want soffits, either.”</p>
<p class="p3">So, Mario finds it worthwhile to reroute pipes and electrical through walls and ceilings. “It gives it a cleaner look and that’s what people want.” In some cases, Mario will push out a wall or ceiling a smidge. “If the ceiling is 10 feet or more, we might drop the ceiling just a little to run services through there.”</p>
<p class="p3">For homeowners who want more room, there is always more space to be had in the back or upward. “Pilot houses,” says Mario, referring to rooftop decks, “are one of the most popular ways to expand upward.” Plus, he sees some clients purchasing two adjacent rowhouse units and removing the wall between the two. This effectively doubles the rowhouse square footage.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Permitting and approvals for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</h3>
<p class="p3">With most substantial Philadelphia rowhouse remodels, you&#8217;ll need permits. Any alteration that costs $10,000 or more requires drawings of the proposed construction. These drawings must have the seal or stamp of a licensed architect or engineer.</p>
<p class="p3">Sweeten general contractors can refer an architect if the services of one are needed. Having an experienced architect and general contractor by your side will help you move through the permitting process more easily.</p>
<p class="p3">Not every Philly rowhouse is a historically designated structure. However, thousands of them are. If yours is one, you’ll need to seek authorization and go through a separate approval process with the Philadelphia Historic Commission.</p>
<p class="p3">Check the <a href="https://www.phila.gov/documents/philadelphia-register-of-historic-places" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Philadelphia Register of Historic Places</span></a> to see if your home is designated as historic.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>4 tips for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Be ready for costlier materials<br />
</b>Renovating a newer home means that you can use a wide range of materials. Many homeowners can find off-the-shelf materials at the local home center to use. But historic Philly rowhouses have masonry, molding, trim, ornamental metals, walls, and ceilings of a more specialized—and costly—nature. Prepare by padding your materials budget.</li>
<li><b>Be available<br />
</b>Remodeling a Philly rowhouse isn’t a “set it and forget it” project. Be available and responsive to everyone working on your project, including the architect, contractor, or project manager.</li>
<li><b>Predict the unpredictable<br />
</b>Prepare yourself and your budget for contract <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/how-do-i-document-change-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change orders</a> (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon). Change orders help your remodel project adapt to unexpected discoveries along the way.</li>
<li><b>Rely on your experts<br />
</b>Unless your daily job is renovating rowhouses, the experts you’ve hired know more than you do. After all, they do this on a daily basis. You’re not just hiring a pair of hands; you’re taking advantage of years of experience and knowledge.</li>
</ol>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no surprise that baths are topping many remodeling lists these days. In Houston, real estate comes in a variety of architectural styles, from French Country and bungalow to Queen Anne and ranch. Plus, b</span><span class="s1">ath trends today cover a range of décor styles that are compatible with your home’s architecture. For those considering their own small bathroom renovation in Houston, here are the need-to-knows and items to plan for before you begin.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your goals for your bathroom renovation?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For most people doing small bathroom renovations, updating the bathroom design is the #1 priority. Who doesn’t welcome a glow-up, especially in the bathroom? Modernizing dated cabinetry and hardware, and installing more stylish faucets are go-to options. So is swapping out a tub for a shower. Or, upgrading the shower with a thermostatic system with integrated volume control. Maybe your luxury shower dreams include multiple body sprays and a rain shower! Many homeowners opt to remove old, tired </span><span class="s1">for a refreshed version. Another key focus in bathroom renovations is adding extra storage. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your needs?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s easier to figure out. Who will use the bath? In a medium-sized bath, do you prefer a tub or shower? Single or double vanity? Take clear notes on any must-have features in your bath. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgeting for a bath remodel in Houston </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help you sort it out, here is what you can expect to pay in Houston, on average. Retaining the footprint in a mid-range bathroom remodel in Houston starts at around $15,000, up to $25,000. Costs will vary based on the materials used, as well as the complexity of installation. For example, a mosaic backsplash is more affordable when the tiles are installed on a sheet. Micro mini tiles installed individually will be more labor-intensive—and more expensive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Materials costs can vary greatly as well, with super affordable options available at big box stores, versus high-end imported tile companies. A powder room may slide into a slightly lower entry-level for costs, but again, it depends on the materials you choose! <em>Read more about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/2020-cost-guide-for-a-home-remodel-in-houston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home renovation costs for Houston.</a></em></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are you likely to recoup in value?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sixty percent, according to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Vs Value</a> report for Houston. Or, almost $12,000; based on a 5-by-7 foot bath that costs around $19,000 or $542 psf. This includes a new 30-by-60 inch porcelain-on-steel bathtub, new single-lever temperature, and pressure-balanced shower control, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How long does a Houston bathroom renovation take?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Sweeten contractors, construction time averages about two to three weeks. However: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning, executing, and finishing</a> can take six weeks to three months—depending on the size and complexity of your project.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to get the most bang for the buck</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When your space is dimensionally challenged (read: small), and you don’t have the room or budget to expand, you still have plenty of options. One way is to create the illusion of more space, by doing one or more of the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Use wall-mounted vanities and toilets.  That extra floor space opens up the room.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Another space enhancer: a solid surface vanity counter with an integral sink.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Install a wall-to-wall mirror behind a long vanity or an oversized round mirrors. Mirrors visually expand space. Some streamlined designs incorporate medicine cabinets.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A classic pedestal sink also is visually slimming. Modern washstands, usually in metal frames, are on-trend options, especially white on black. More traditional sinks with turned console legs offer additional metal choices, like brass or polished nickel.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Building in storage wherever you can tuck in shelves for towels and essentials. Recessed niches in the shower for shampoo and conditioner also are smart.  </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Swap a tub for a roomy walk-in shower with an all-glass frame. If there’s a window, natural light will flow through, visually boosting the dimensions of the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why should you consider neutrals in the bathroom? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many homeowners opt for white and beige in baths because it’s safe. But that doesn’t mean it has to be boring! Designers use a few tricks of the trade to keep neutrals feel fresh. One trick is the magic of tone-on-tone—but with nuances. (That means mixing different shades of neutral, from light to dark.) Another trick is to pair neutrals with different textures.  Get this look by pairing a dimensional wallcovering or an embossed tile with a polished or smooth surface.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding color to a bathroom </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We love when homeowners go bold in the bathroom and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/home/design/article/35-ideas-to-amp-up-your-bathroom-s-style-15404821.php#photo-19670294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color outside the lines</a>. Some argue that vibrant colors can take over smaller spaces, like powder rooms. But others feel that’s the perfect venue for bold cobalt or emerald, a spicy tangerine, or saffron. Precisely <em>because</em> it’s a small space, you can afford to be dramatic—and even splurge on faucets and towel holders, plus lighting and a fancy wallcovering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Color doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to walls: consider the countertop or the vanity. Blues and greens—bright and pale—are gaining traction in traditional, country, and modern styles.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Comparing bathroom remodeling materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stone has some hefty competition these days from porcelain tile. Porcelain is not confined to small format 4-, 6- or 12-inch tiles. Porcelain comes in slabs, some very thin yet sturdy, which can be applied to walls and floors. And with digital technology, manufacturers are able to replicate some of the most desirable marbles (Carrara or Calacatta) or granites.  The look of exotic-colored stones also is available with remarkable authenticity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, matte black is a hot trend in faucets and hardware. Burnished and polished gold are also trending, and pairing them with black is especially chic. Mixing metals, like satin metal and polished nickel with gold also is more acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One guideline for choosing materials that are basically semi-permanent: Being on-trend (modernizing the classics) is fine, but being trendy (here now, gone tomorrow) is not.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Be sure to allow enough time</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As soon as you have a plan, try to get through the selection process for materials as quickly as you can. Ask about inventory even before you place your order, so you’re not disappointed. You may be unpleasantly surprised to find that your favorite tile or stone, or that dreamy vanity you&#8217;ve got your eye on, will take an extra 6 to 8 weeks to show up. However, i</span><span class="s1">f you can’t imagine living without it, go for it! It may be well worth the wait.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Demolition and prep</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On average, ripping out old bathroom material is a day’s work. It depends on how large the room is, and how extensive the renovation will be. For instance, removing a tile floor or wall may take a bit longer. Tweaking plumbing and electrical, which may require rerouting or new wiring, also is part of the process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Installation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve passed through the rough and dirty parts, and now you’re in the fun phase. When surfaces, fixtures, and lighting get installed (allow 1 to 3 days), take a moment to enjoy it! Grab some pictures on your phone to show your family and friends. </span></p>
<h3>Follow the experts&#8217; lead for small bathroom renovations</h3>

<h3>What is design-build?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms are a growing segment of the construction landscape. About 15% of the American Institute of Building Design (AIBD) members are now design-build firms, said Steve Mickley, the executive director of the organization, which is made up of designers, builders, and architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, a design-build firm takes care of both the design and construction phases of a renovation project. Traditionally, the process involved homeowners working with a designer or an architect before taking those plans over to a general contractor to execute the vision. Now, those specialties exist under one roof with design-build. Here, we explain the role of these remodeling professionals.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How are design-build companies structured? </h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no clear-cut definition as to what a design-build firm is and who is in their employ. Usually, a firm will either be more design-forward, primarily led by an architect or a designer, or construction-forward with a general contractor taking the reins. Of course, some firms can be an even balance of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the scenario of the firm and your project, “the best approach is to interview as many people as it takes to find someone you feel comfortable with,&#8221; advised Mickley. That could mean going with a design-build firm or handpicking a designer and a general contractor. This more traditional method is called design, bid, and build, or DBB. It is where the designer or architect is hired separately from the general contractor. </p>
<h4>Are professional design services always necessary for a remodel?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not every remodeling project needs a designer or architect. According to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association, only 22% of homeowners renovating a kitchen or bathroom seek professional design assistance. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down their total costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if the scope of your project involves structural changes like moving load-bearing walls or shifting plumbing or gas lines, you will at least need an architect or engineer to approve your renovation plans. Bringing in design help is also a good option if you want meticulous planning and attention to visual details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What are the benefits of hiring a design-build company?</h3>
<h4>&#8220;One-stop&#8221; shop</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms operate as a “one-stop shop” for home construction, said Mickley. This means homeowners only need to explain their vision to one person who then communicates it to the single design-build team. This is also the case throughout the project. If a change needs to be made, no need to discuss it with your designer or architect and then communicate it to your general contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a design-build firm, you should have one point person throughout the entire length of your project who is accountable for the timeline, the budget, and delivering what the homeowner wants. “The same person who has the vision has the responsibility to make that happen,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Project management help</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some homeowners want to closely oversee their renovations. Others don’t. For the latter group, a design-build firm might be a good fit. Rather than the homeowner overseeing the two moving parts of the design and construction phase, a design-build firm watches over both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a little help with managing a project but aren’t sure you want a design-build firm to take care of the whole thing, some designers or architects may offer a service to help oversee the job. “This is where the designer or architect makes periodic site visits to make sure the general contractor is doing everything to the specifications,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Guaranteed synergy</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s always a risk of a personality clash when you pair two humans together. That includes your choice of designer or architect and general contractor. They could work together seamlessly, or they could not. Working with a design-build firm basically eliminates that risk. The design half and construction half would have worked together on many projects and likely created a firm together based on their positive collaboration. “Depending on the project, you could be working with them for six to 12 months, so it’s best to choose wisely,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">A faster project</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong with any project and slow the timeline down, including one managed by a design-build firm. However, this type of firm will likely complete a job at a faster pace. A study commissioned by the DBIA found that commercial projects using design-build firms finished about 33% faster than those that used the traditional design, bid, and build process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s reason to think residential projects could also move faster with a design-build firm. That’s because there is likely an overlap between the design and construction phase rather than a lull in momentum when the design phase ends and a general contractor takes up the build phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes you make along the way could also be done faster, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary</a>, who heads up a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>-vetted design-build firm. Often with the traditional design, bid, and build workflow, a change to your project will require some back and forth between architect and general contractor to see what’s possible and what the best way forward is. This could hold the project up for weeks or more. With a design-build firm, you have your architect and builder already working together and abreast of the project. “Pretty much within a couple of days we can have everything sorted out,” said Gary.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less expensive (maybe)</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that design-build is slowly gaining momentum in the residential market, the data isn’t yet available to know what workflow method is easier on the pocketbook. In commercial construction, DBIA found that projects with this category of professionals came in at six percent cheaper when compared with similar jobs using the design, bid, and build workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why you might NOT prefer design-build</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less control</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we mentioned above, a design-build firm generally means less control for the homeowner, which is great if that’s what you want. However, if you know you want to be hands-on with your construction project, take that into consideration when choosing between design-build or the typical design, bid, and build.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less choice of professionals</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, this can be a pro or a con. It’s definitely a con if you have your heart set on an architect and a general contractor who are not part of the same firm. One thing Mickley advised when considering a design-build firm is to ensure they can produce quality designs. “Some design-build firms call themselves that, but they really don’t possess the design portion,” he said. “They just subcontract that out.”</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">More objective solutions</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having the eyes of a separate general contractor and architect could mean more objective observations about how your project is progressing. It could also mean more ideas. If there’s a problem in need of a solution, you have your architect or designer as well as your general contractor to brainstorm with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sweeten can help you hire the right firm</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of which way you ultimately lean on your construction and design, selecting who you work with is a crucial decision. “Once you’ve made that decision, you have to give them your full trust,” said Gary.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<h2></h2>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933324509"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is design-build?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms are firms that provide a homeowner with a general contractor, architect, and/or interior designer. They are considered “one-stop” shops because they offer varying services within one company. Design-build firms might be more design-based, some more construction-heavy, and others have a good balance of each. A positive aspect of these firms is communication: because these teams are built to work together, there’s less confusion about responsibilities or how to connect with the renovating homeowner.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933385594"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Are design-build firms more expensive?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms can be more expensive to work with than construction-only firms because the service level they offer is higher. These firms are ideal for renovating homeowners who want to (or need to) enlist the help of an architect and/or interior designer, in addition to a general contractor. For example, homeowners doing a transformational gut renovation will likely need the help of a design-build firm.</p>

<em>Guest post by Chris, Ditmas Park homeowner<br />
</em><br />
For six of the seven years that we have owned our one-bedroom co-op apartment in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, our dream was to renovate it. A year ago, we did just that, but the path there was far from a straight line. When we actually looked into what a renovation would mean in terms of time, cost, and effort, with all the headaches that co-ops can entail, we realized that just buying another apartment would be infinitely easier. (Having our two-year-old in the bedroom with us definitely added the kind of urgency that any parent can probably relate to). When we started to look for two-bedroom apartments that actually felt like upgrades in terms of space and location, we found virtually nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So it had to be a renovation. But how? We started to tackle the issues one by one. We figured out the financing, looked into sublets, and tenuously read through the pages and pages of legal documents our co-op’s management company required before any work could happen. When it came to finding an architect to work with us, we hit a brick wall. Our job was too small for the architects we had seen featured on our favorite design blogs, but too big to just leave to a contractor to wing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was when we discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation project</a> to their site, and they led us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Sweeten general contractors</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to convert our eat-in kitchen into a bedroom for our son and open up the rest of the kitchen into the living room, but we had no idea how. Our contractor duo won us over with their easygoing demeanors and their innovative design for our space, which involved sealing off the existing entry to the galley kitchen and completely opening it up to the living room. It meant one less doorway in our foyer which already felt like a cross between Grand Central and a stroller parking lot, and one big living/eating/cooking space that would feel open and airy, the opposite of the rabbit warren we feared the apartment would become by carving another bedroom out of it. Then we found out that Amber was pregnant again, and things got real, real fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17193 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17180 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-09.jpg" alt="half galley kitchen in ditmas park" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-09-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractors brought a team to the table who were very competitively priced for work with a high degree of detail and things suddenly started to fall into place: financing, co-op, and management company approval, permits. Our contractors served as our construction managers as well as our architects which enabled them to oversee all aspects of construction and deal with most issues long before we ever were aware. They had regular meetings with us to make sure we knew exactly where we were in the process. It meant we could deal with the fun stuff &#8212; configuring our cabinets and open shelves, choosing the right quartz countertops and lighting, and spending less time worrying about the day to day construction details and timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We went into this project with the intention of buying ourselves a few more years in the apartment, since ultimately we want to move to a house outside the city. Knowing we would sell in a few years, we bought appliances that have outstanding value but aren’t necessarily top of the top. The NXR range is fantastic for the money, plenty good for the cooking we do at home, and great looking. Our fridge is a Summit since we needed a true counter-depth fridge (just wait until you realize how many manufacturers call their products counter-depth when they are anything but), and our Bosch dishwasher is everything we could want, considering it is the first dishwasher my wife and I have ever had.</p>
