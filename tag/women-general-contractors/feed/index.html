<p>In honor of Women&#8217;s History month, we are spotlighting women general contractors in the general contracting field. These <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors are leading the charge and closing the gender gap.</p>
<p>With years of experience under their belts, their firms include experts who handle a myriad of projects—from residential room remodels and full-home renovations to commercial work.</p>
<p>In the last of a five-part series, we feature women contractors who have the skills and industry knowledge to make your home-sweet-home a reality.</p>
<h3>Sweeten General Contractor Emily | Long Island, NY</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47728 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cristhian.jpg" alt="Image of three rooms in a home with staircase, dining room and bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cristhian.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cristhian-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">General contractor Emily and her partner, Cristhian, focus on entire home renovation projects. </span>They oversee a team of expert craftsmen whose objective is to deliver high-quality construction services to Suffolk County residents. They aim to stay on budget and on time for each and every project. &#8220;Their biggest strength is the quality of work,&#8221; says one client. Excellent communication was also a characteristic that was noted. This client subsequently hired the firm for other projects on his rental homes.

<h3>Sweeten General Contractor Tara | Houston, TX</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47726 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara.jpg" alt="Image of a white bathroom with bathtub and a kitchen with gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Build. Restore. Renovate. Those are the three words that sum up general contractor Tara&#8217;s construction firm&#8217;s offerings. As one of the women general contractors in our network, Tara and her partner have 50 years of experience combined.</p>
<p>Her projects are primarily in the Houston area working on commercial, residential, and multi-family homes. &#8220;We are small enough to listen and big enough to deliver,&#8221; says Tara. And her clients agree, often leaving five-star reviews.

<p>She has also been in the position to fix past renovation mistakes.

<p>For Women&#8217;s History month, we are spotlighting women general contractors who are in our network. They are leading the way while closing the gender gap. With solid work portfolios, their firms have completed a wide range of projects—from single-room remodels to full-home renovations and additions. This post, the second in a five-part series, profiles some of the most talented <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors across our various cities.</p>
<h3>Sweeten General Contractor Leah | New York City</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47676" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO.jpg" alt="Women owned general contractor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>General contractor Leah has owned and operated her contracting business in NYC for almost 15 years, with experience in different points of the process. Her company completes a wide range of construction activities, from pre-development to turnover. Serving both the public and private sector, Leah has worked on projects ranging in scope and skillsets—from a condo fitness center and Victorian home restoration to a modern high-rise apartment. Each of her projects gets assigned a dedicated project manager to ensure it is completed on time and on budget. See more of Leah&#8217;s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4719#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remodeling work and reviews</a> on our website.</p>
<h3>Sweeten General Contractor Ishita | Long Island, NY</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47588 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Ishita&#8217;s main focus is customer service. It&#8217;s a point of pride not to use &#8220;pushy sales tactics or upselling&#8221; to retain clients. Instead, she prefers to let the work speak for itself. Ishita&#8217;s general contracting firm handles all different types of renovations in Suffolk County, New York, located on Long Island. For example, she has completed single-room makeovers as well as large estate renovations. The general contractor also plans, manages, and builds multi-phase jobs. Above all, Ishita remains focused on the overall experience. &#8220;It really is about how our customers feel at the end [that matters].&#8221; <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5230#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Sweeten contractor Ishita&#8217;s reviews and work.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Not only do women have the right skill sets to be contractors, but they can also hand the family business to daughters.<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48287" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 0;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/JeanOnSite.jpg" alt="women contractors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/JeanOnSite.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/JeanOnSite-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/JeanOnSite-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean Brownhill, Sweeten’s founder and a trained architect, started the company to bring support and guidance to general contractors. She also created SAW (Sweeten Accelerator for Women), a mission to advocate and promote skilled women contractors. The aim was to shift the current professional model and help bridge the gender gap for established and growing firms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average $67,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, Jean offers a view into why she started SAW and the opportunities she sees for Sweeten to help women grow their construction businesses. </span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Women already in the contractor role</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have personally seen a lot of women go into interior design or architecture and work in these industries for many years. What I saw was that we were frequently doing the job of the general contractor: managing subcontractors, choosing materials, or coming up with construction details. It&#8217;s so obvious to me that women are already doing that work—and just not being compensated for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the <a href="https://www.sweeten-saw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reason why I started SAW—</a>and why I started Sweeten in general—because I believe that internet technology and the web allows for new access points. It allows for new opportunities. In the past,  a woman would have had an incredibly hard time becoming a general contractor, getting clients, or hiring the subcontractor networks they needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now there&#8217;s so much transparency and opportunity. Sweeten provides that job deal flow that can help a woman-led general contracting firm not only in its first few years of business but also as the company continues to grow. We are so excited to support that. </span></p>
<h3>Including daughters in the conversation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general contractor and the construction industry have long been dictated by nepotism and through union participation. Union participation is related to commercial work and we don&#8217;t typically do that type of project. In residential, however, it&#8217;s mostly through nepotism. Fathers would hand down their construction businesses to their sons—an intergenerational transfer. In some ways, Sweeten’s platform can help with the mentorship and tutelage to help women grow their businesses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conversations with our male general contractors, we have said, &#8220;Hey, you should think about giving this business to your daughter.&#8221; In fact, we have one in our network right now whose daughter went to architecture school. I said, &#8220;Your daughter should take over your business.&#8221; He said, &#8220;That&#8217;s so funny you&#8217;re saying that. I was just having that conversation and didn&#8217;t even think that she would want it.&#8221; And she does.</span></p>
<h3>Breaking the contractor stereotype</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the power of storytelling and our blog, we’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighting the incredible projects</a> that our women general contractors have completed and are really changing the narrative around what the job is. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The job of a general contractor—it is logistics, it is communication, it is delegation. You have to marshal labor and materials to a job site and orchestrate the labor and the materials to come together to finish a project. You do not need to swing a hammer. You do not need to be a burly guy. Whenever the image of a general contractor is, it is a false one. Those executive functioning skills, women are great at that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all those reasons, it was clear to me that a program like SAW needed to exist. We’re so excited to be able to support these women general contractors. Hopefully, it will encourage more women to join the industry because they have the skillset for it. It&#8217;s a great profession and offers a path to small business ownership. The hours can be very flexible if you have children at home. </span></p>
<h3>Building a flow of work</h3>
<p>Our women general contractors do not have a problem with getting hired by homeowners. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is when women need to secure additional subcontractor labor and get them to work on their projects. Subcontractors still have a very outdated idea about who a general contractor is. The good news is that if there is a steady deal flow and steady work, money does talk. They can break that up really quick.</span></p>
