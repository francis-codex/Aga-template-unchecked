<p>When deciding whether to renovate your home, many aspects are considered. Having your <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget and scope aligned</a> and how to best <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage and prepare for delays</a> are top questions.</p>
<p>Another concern is finding the right renovation partner to help guide through the process and execute the vision. Here, three Sweeten renovators had these exact thoughts. They wanted their new space to match their life and design style. They wanted a trusted professional to do the job. And they needed it done sooner rather than later. They turned to Sweeten to find their contractors and get their projects moving.</p>

<h3>A Bronx Home Transforms into a Home, Sweet, Rental</h3>

<h4>The kitchen takes center stage</h4>
<p>Sally’s house, an attached, two-family home in the Bronx, had been in her family since it was originally built in 1993. She occupied the top-floor apartment while her sister and her family lived below. As co-owners of the 2,700-square-foot home, the siblings wanted to renovate but would do it slowly in parts based on their budget. However, Sally had decided to move out so her apartment was bumped to the top of their renovation list. The space would be updated to attract renters. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/107182#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their kitchen renovation project</a> on Sweeten and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7019#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired their Sweeten general contractor.</a></p>
<p>They decided to tackle the most popular space in any home: the kitchen. People are naturally drawn to a kitchen and love spending time there with family and friends. So Sally knew that upgrading her existing outdated kitchen would make the whole apartment more enticing to renters. She wanted to open up the area to make it appear larger and add more storage. She knew this would also increase the functionality of the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-and-white-floor-tiles" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03.jpg" alt="Beige kitchen closed cabinets over white tile flooring before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51425" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-gray-kitchen-with-gray-backplash" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="Light gray kitchen with gray backsplash along with closed cabinet and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51650" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The design would be simple—and create a space that was easy to maintain. She consulted with her contractor on materials that would keep her within her budget. The contractor removed a half-wall that was in between the kitchen and living space, added plumbing, and removed unnecessary beams. The space is now completely open. Aesthetically speaking, gray was the deciding color palette for the cabinetry, appliances, and backsplash. The result is a neutral, contemporary kitchen that is pleasing to all tastes and styles.</p>
<h4>Sally&#8217;s Sweeten contractor goes above and beyond</h4>
<p>Sally relied heavily on her Sweeten contractor throughout the process. He introduced her to a designer who helped Sally move her vision forward. He also made frequent trips to the home improvement store helping Sally search and purchase backsplash tiles that weren&#8217;t on the original list of materials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-gray-kitchen-cabinets-with-gray-countertop" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="Light gray kitchen cabinets with gray countertop along a gray backsplash and small sink after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51655" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>Thankfully, Sally described the kitchen renovation as uneventful. “The crew came in, did their jobs, and went home,” said Sally. “They were all very professional and came to my house to work.” And she can’t decide on just one aspect of the design that’s her favorite. She loves it all—from the storage space to the color and the functionality.</p>

<h3>A Fort Greene Condo Shows Off Chic Black Renovation Materials</h3>

<h4>The bath gets an upgrade</h4>
<p>For Jesse and his partner Malik, their renovation came out of necessity. Their 934-square-foot condo in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was water damaged. They needed to fix it—and quickly. “We were very concerned about drying out the place, getting the demolition completed, and covering the ‘basics,’” said Jesse. They interviewed a half-dozen contractors on their own. The couple also <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37029#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on Sweeten and a helpful assist with comparing all of the estimates led to the decision <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to hire this Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p>Jesse and Malik lived in the apartment for 10 years before the water damage so they wanted to take advantage of some improvements. And not just rip and replace what was originally there. For the bathroom, they added a pocket door, which was helpful to make the best use of the space. A niche was created for storage. For the shower, half of a wall was removed and a hand shower was added. The final result was a mix of contemporary forms with convenient functionalities.</p>

<h4>A bold and dramatic kitchen transformation</h4>
<p>The look for the kitchen would be decidedly contemporary. Inspired by a photo of a kitchen with a matte black palette, the couple set out to put their own spin on it. Adding to the dramatic palette, a quartzite slab countertop from Brazil had some delays but was well worth the wait. “The stone really brings so much movement to the space,” said Jesse.</p>
<p>Despite eye-catching countertops, the cabinets were not overshadowed. The couple hired a millworker—recommended by their Sweeten contractor—who made custom cabinets. The best part? They are maple plywood with a “traceless” ultra-matte finish, which translates to fewer fingerprints. And perhaps the couple&#8217;s favorite feature of the kitchen is the waterfall peninsula. “It’s a great finishing touch,” said Jesse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-kitchen-cabinets-with-kitchen-island" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Black kitchen cabinets with kitchen island and recessed light fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51645" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Jesse and Malik found their Sweeten contractor to be a flexible partner <span class="s1">throughout the process, offering useful feedback and working through the issues when they came up. </span>“He understood from the start that we had a certain vision for the outcome,” said Jesse. “And he steered us to ensure we wouldn’t be disappointed.” The couple just loves that their new space “suits us and our style.”</p>

<h3>A Tub-to-Shower Swap Shines in a Chicago Bathroom</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="man-sitting-on-a-white-couch" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07.jpg" alt="Man sitting on a white couch" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51665" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Jonathan, a CPA and CIA, redoing his bathroom was a must. When he bought his 720-square-foot condo located in the River North section of Chicago, he knew it needed repair. But after a year of living with the outdated bathroom, he decided it was time to pull the trigger on a renovation and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/108977#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post his project</a> on Sweeten.</p>
<p>Jonathan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6168#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired a Sweeten general contractor</a> in his area and the work began. At first, Jonathan only intended to rip out the bathtub and replace it with a standing shower. However, his friends convinced him otherwise. They suggested that since he hired a contractor, he might as well replace more than just the tub. Jonathan agreed and decided to give the bathroom an added refresh by upgrading the tiles in the shower wall and floor as well.</p>

<h4>A subtle but satisfying change</h4>
<p>Jonathan&#8217;s biggest question he needed advice on: What do I need to buy? For this, he turned to his general contractor who guided him on each of the materials he would need and the quantity.</p>
<p>The change was not drastic but it was one that satisfied Jonathan’s wish: to have an open shower look with only a glass divide—no door, no tub. The tiles on the shower wall are large-format, which visually expands a space. They are typically chosen for their modern vibe and clean aesthetic. To add texture and pattern, a gray hexagonal mosaic for the shower floor was brought into the mix. Mosaic tiles are not only pleasing to the eye but serve a functional purpose. Small tiles require more grout creating a non-slip surface.</p>
<p>Jonathan is happy with the way the project turned out. “I love that I can walk in my shower,” said Jonathan. “And it looks pretty!” It has gotten him thinking about future renovations. “I still have a few more projects in the pipeline!”</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Compact kitchen overhaul in an Upper West Side high-rise studio</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Despite its condition, the owner, who works in real estate, actually remembers his old 85-square-foot kitchen with surprising fondness. Beneath a harsh fluorescent fixture, low-end plastic laminate cabinets and counters were worn and stained. Above the 1980’s white stove, the hood’s exposed exhaust hose was sloppily sealed using pieces of tape. The floor was a dated black-and-white resilient tile checkerboard.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The delighted owner notes that this “reno way exceeded my expectations.” As his Sweeten profile requested, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his contractor</a> handled the co-op’s intimidating application process. None of the appliances or worn-out finishes were worth saving—only the new refrigerator was relocated. Glossy modern white cabinets make the space feel less narrow than brown wood upper cabinets could have. Undercabinet LED lights shine onto the engineered quartz countertop. The undulating wall tiles were found on a showroom shopping trip with his contractor, and the owner first saw large-format slate-look floor tiles on design blogs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The contractor’s cabinetmaker matched the budget-friendly veneer so that the grain continues from one section of lower cabinets to the next without interruption.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Style finds</span>: 30-inch gas <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/cooking-baking/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a> slide-in stainless range; <a href="https://www.samsung.com/levant/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> refrigerator; <a href="https://www.sharpusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharp</a> microwave; <a href="https://www.kraususa.com/kitchen/kitchen-sinks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krauss</a> under-mount stainless sink; backsplash tile by <a href="https://www.wowdesigneu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WOW Design EU</a>; American Standard one-hole deck-mount chrome faucet from <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>; engineered countertop in Pearl White from <a href="https://pentalquartz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pental</a>; <a href="https://zephyronline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zephyr</a> Breeze recirculating hood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I love my new kitchen!  Although I had picked every element of the new kitchen, I was concerned that the finished whole was not going to be equivalent to the sum of all the parts; would it work cohesively in the end?  There were a few stressful times, and I did have to make some quick decisions that could have gone awry, but ultimately, I set out to achieve some major objectives and I believe I more than met them all.  I have more cabinet space, more countertop space, larger appliances, it feels much more modern and homey, and it was done in a fairly budget- and time-conscious way.  In fact, my kitchen now makes the rest of my apartment now look pretty shabby!<span id="more-9437"></span></p>

<p><strong>The Budget</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I generally stayed within budget.  As I said, it was a &#8220;renovation-on-a-budget.&#8221; I had originally planned to spend $6,000, which increased to $9,000 when I decided to replace my appliances.  In the end, I hit almost $11,000, but that was because of a couple of “extras” that I did not account for – delivery charges, taxes, etc. I also asked Peter to install some new medicine cabinets in my bathroom. Renovations can be addicting, I just did not want to stop!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>30 Days After</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For me, the hardest part of having a new kitchen was figuring out where everything goes afterwards. I suppose in hindsight, I should have planned where my dishes, silverware, cleaning supplies, pantry items, etc, would be kept. My objective was just to maximize storage efficiently, as best I could, but I didn’t actually think about which cabinets would store which items!  Lucky for me, I put in enough drawers and cabinets that I just about found a place for everything. Minus a few tall items, like my Swiffer.  Oops – note to self for next time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve also put my kitchen through a few test runs at this point, having hosted two dinner parties already, one for my family (party of 7) and one for a few girlfriends (party of 4).  The new arrangement deftly allowed my fiancé and I to cook and clean together, with minimal fuss.  My kitchen report card after 30 days?  I still heart it – it’s so bright and clean and modern, I&#8217;m 100% glad I did it!</p>
