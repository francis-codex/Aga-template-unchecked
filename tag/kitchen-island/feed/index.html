Over 60 percent of homeowners use kitchen islands to eat meals. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, the same amount of homeowners use islands for meal preparation. This allows for more counter space along with greater interaction between the cook and guests as food is prepared. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen island has become another place for remote work and learning. Just under 60 percent of homeowners use islands for these purposes. If you&#8217;re ready to renovate, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find the right contractor</a> at Sweeten to see how a kitchen island can work in your space.</span></p><h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pantries—more than food storage</span></h3><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not only are small appliances often stored in pantries, but 67 percent of homeowners use the space to operate those appliances. As a result, this contains any mess and keeps the jumble of cords and power outlets out of sight.  </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A similar percentage of kitchens utilize pantries as coffee centers. Like mini cafe counters, coffee appliances, utensils, and ingredients are within easy reach. A smaller number of homeowners use pantries to store cookware, operate microwaves, and for food prep. </span></p>					</div>

Their Sweeten contractor also revamped the layout to make the best use of the space. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the top of their list was a white kitchen island.

Enlisting the help of architect Daniel Gomez, the dark and dated &#8217;60s kitchen transformed into modern day.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faux-brick backsplash was removed and the layout opened up. That freed up room to add a spacious white kitchen island with seating. It was not just a statement piece, it was also functional.

The space was great—it had a good amount of square footage. However, the appliances and cabinetry were outdated. Their contractor helped them reconfigure the space to include one of the wishlist items: a kitchen island.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The island is a sleek addition as an anchor or hub. The natural wood base is elegantly enclosed in a blizzard-white waterfall countertop that extends along the sides to the floor. The inspiration for this style of island came from a previous project. “I had redone my radiator covers and my windowsills with white slabs and I thought it would look nice to match that,” Sarah said.</span></p>					</div>

</ul>
<h3>Reimagining the Bed-Stuy home for family life</h3>
<p>This Bedford-Stuyvesant home once belonged to the homeowner&#8217;s grandmother. The home came with fond memories of her childhood, so she happily inherited it. However, as the townhouse had been built in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, it needed a lot of work. She would remodel it to accommodate the needs of her own family. They planned for an open concept layout, with open sightlines to keep the family together while in different rooms. To modernize the spaces, they&#8217;d outfit their dream kitchen and bathroom with new, state-of-the-art appliances and finishes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg" alt="Exterior of the Bed-Stuy home with front yard and metal gate" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>She turned to Sweeten to find a contractor she&#8217;d be comfortable with handling this important renovation. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the right contractor</a> with experience in old-home remodels. They signed the contract and the work began!</p>
<h3>Necessary behind-the-wall updates</h3>
<p>First, fixing the systems behind the walls had to be done to support updated materials and appliances. The plumbing had corroded and was located in inefficient places. The electrical also needed to be upgraded. Their Sweeten contractor found improperly connected wires in the ceiling, which posed a fire hazard. The subfloor had to be ripped out, and the joists had to be reinforced to keep the kitchen floor from collapsing.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-and-gray-kitchen-cabinet-with-island" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07.jpg" alt="White and gray kitchen cabinets with kitchen island after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51527 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>All this work made the kitchen functional and safe. The design aesthetic came next. The homeowner chose a contemporary combination of white cabinets along the kitchen perimeter, and gray base cabinets for the island. The owners selected quartz countertops for the work surface, due to their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasonable price point and durability</a>. The island became the focal point of the room, which also featured deliberate pops of color, like the must-have bright red range. Other features, such as a gold-finish pot filler, pull-out storage cabinets, and a built-in wine rack, completed the look.</p>
<h3>New layout and features</h3>
<p>The rest of the Bed-Stuy home benefited from the remodel, too. Their contractor removed a wall between the kitchen and living area to open up the flow. They also installed new wood floors, along with all-new recessed lights, a closet, and a front door. Another addition: a new laundry room, which replaced an existing screened-in porch area. The contractor fully outfitted the laundry room—from reconstructing electrical, plumbing, and insulation to subflooring and venting.</p>

<h3>Rejuvenating the master bathroom</h3>
<p>Like the kitchen, the master bathroom would become her dream bathroom. As a mom, it would be her sanctuary. A standalone tub would give her the chance to unwind. The construction crew faced a challenge: nestling the tub into a tight niche without damaging or touching the walls. But the crew completed the task handily, with the result being an inviting clawfoot oasis, flanked on one end by a custom vanity. In a nod to wainscoting, the team <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed the bathroom tile</a> halfway up the wall.</p>

<h3>Working with the right contractor</h3>
<p>For this nostalgic renovation, the homeowner saw and worked with her Sweeten contractor for months. Fortunately, she found the right partner who understood her vision. This partnership allowed them to communicate throughout the process and solve problems when issues arose. A solid working bond between the client and Sweeten contractor formed, so much so, when it looked like their renovation would not be done in time for Thanksgiving, their contractor invited them to celebrate with his family. Luckily, their new home is now ready to create brand new memories for years to come.</p>

			<h2 class="p1">From efficient ADUs to spa-like bathrooms, home interior design in Los Angeles points to simplicity, utility, and going traditional</h2>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel for actress Jaime Ray Newman los angeles" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Diversity is king when it comes to home interior design in Los Angeles. The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles</span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.</p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Top photo</em>) Sweeten renovators and actor Jaime Ray Newman and Guy Nattiv&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles home renovation</a></span></p>
<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles</h3>
<p class="p2">“We didn’t really see much of a change,” said Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5968#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA general contractor Trevor</a>. “It&#8217;s just a redirect.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs</span><span class="s2">.</span> “The cost of lumber is affecting building,” said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. “People are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">A renewed focus on outdoor living</h3>
<p class="p2">“A lot more people are fixing their exterior,” said Trevor. “People want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, that’s where you spend 60 percent of your time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.cozystylishchic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung</a> agreed. “It’s all about indoor-outdoor living,” she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. “They double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,” said Jeanne.</p>
<p class="p2">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.</p>
<p class="p2">Homeowners are also investing in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor rooms</a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, “definitely going back to nature.” Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. “A salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, there’s a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.”</p>
<h3 class="p5">ADUs and additions for more square footage</h3>
<p class="p2">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). “It’s generating the <span style="color: #333333;">biggest buzz,” said <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Trevor. </span>These detached structures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often garages</a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. “They’re knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David&#8217;s</a> Mid-City/Miracle Mile home in LA</span></p>
<p class="p2">“You can build a second story,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. It’s getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.” If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in LA</a> with experience will guide you through the process.</p>
<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated</h3>
<p class="p6">“It’s where you get the most <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bang for the buck</a>,” said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to kitchens</a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. “It’s like changing wardrobes.”</p>
<p class="p2">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But there’s not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, there’s more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looks—tile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="geometric-pattern-black-white-backsplash-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-50846 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg" alt="peninsula island in kitchen with white marble countertop and undermount sink with gold faucet and fixtures and pendant lights and black kitchen cabinets and geometric pattern black white backsplash tiles and vent over cooking range after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.</li>
<li class="p2">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.</li>
<li class="p2">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.</li>
<li class="p2">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">“Here in LA, my clients don’t want polished,” said Jeanne. “I am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.” Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because it’s pretty porous.</p>
<h4>Finishes lead the way</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colors—black, deep blues, and bottle greens—are ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. “I do a lot of antiqued blue—like a muted denim—with brass pulls,” he said.</li>
<li class="p2">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trend—with an average of 7&#8243;—and in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.</li>
<li class="p2">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">The spa bath is redefined</h3>
<p class="p2">In Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrading the whole bathroom</a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force</i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you won’t find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-vanity-marble-countertop-hanging-mirror" class="alignnone wp-image-50847 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg" alt="large gray single vanity with white marble countertop and brushed nickel hardware and gold faucet and fixtures and hanging circular mirror infront of window after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Variations of brass finishes in this LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The divide—choosing between tub and shower—is more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return on investment</a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.</p>
<p class="p2">More than ever, the bath is <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an oasis</a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets</h3>
<p class="p2">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Storage is key</h3>
<p class="p2">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Kevin&#8217;s</a> Westchester home in LA</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Mudrooms are still going strong</h3>
<p class="p2">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. “Especially with the pandemic,” she said, “There’s a desire for bigger mudrooms. It’s like a decontamination area—coming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.” Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.</p>
<h3 class="p2">There’s an uptick in requests for libraries</h3>
<p class="p2">“It’s a very popular room right now,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s only going to get more popular. I’ve had three customers recently tell me they want libraries—real traditional, with everything built in.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Home offices are making a comeback</h3>
<p class="p2">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husband’s office more fashionable—because of his frequent video calls.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="p2">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.</li>
<li class="p2">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.</li>
<li class="p2">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic codes</a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Find a contractor</span></a></p>
<h3 class="p2">Classic and traditional design emerges</h3>
<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">“Mid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,” he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming back—I would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently I’ve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.”</li>
<li class="p2">Statement decorating is hot. It’s part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash. Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.</li>
<li class="p2">There’s an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.</li>
<li class="p2">“Simplicity—we’re definitely going in that direction,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “Not so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.” There’s a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.</li>
<li class="p2">California style—with a modern or rustic refined look—still is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.</li>
</ul>

			<h2>4 ways to renovate for an entertainment kitchen that&#8217;ll help gatherings go smoothly</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41135 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Image of a New Jersey kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you love to entertain, you&#8217;ll look at your living spaces for optimal flow and comfort. Whether<span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting together a gathering, large or small, and in any season, your space needs to be functional and efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the kitchen is the main hub for entertaining, a few changes can get your space soiree-ready. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we look at recent Sweeten kitchen renovations that keep homeowners entertainment-ready. Organized pantries, a peninsula or island for workspace, or removing walls so that everyone is brought in on the action are just a few ideas.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>Parties are made possible by pantries</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any chef will tell you, you should always keep some basic culinary staples in the house. Even a simple stash allows you to throw together a last-minute dinner party. But storing these must-have ingredients (think stocks, spices, and starches) means freeing up space in your kitchen. That’s where a well-designed pantry comes in! These pantries are also clutch even if you have a longer time to plan a party, since they can be used to store your serving dishes and other accouterments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-50510 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg" alt="gray kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white countertop and large pantry shelf after renovation" width="2560" height="1707" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the case for Sweeten homeowners </span> Nilda and Brian <span style="font-weight: 400;">. They chose shallower cabinets but a wider pantry unit. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t lose anything in the back and can save the money by not adding the mechanical pullouts you would need for deep pantries,” says Nilda.</span></p>
<h3>Open-concept equals open house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a large space to host is a homeowner&#8217;s dream. However, many spaces don’t start out open and airy, especially if your home or apartment is older. But by taking down a wall or even just part of it, you can make your kitchen more inviting and comfortable for guests when entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45624 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Image of an open concept kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montclair, New Jersey, couple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) turned to Sweeten to help turn their “old” kitchen into a more livable space—with room for entertaining. They tore down two walls, including the wall between the dining room and kitchen to create an open concept. Plus, they also found enough space for an island counter—a double win for entertaining! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="large-window-in-dining" class="alignnone wp-image-41291 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="large window in the dining area and kitchen island with pendant lights and picture frame molding on walls and tile flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Joe’s New Jersey kitchen renovation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Sweeten also included a redesign of their kitchen layout. They asked their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contractor to knock down a wall to get better sightlines to the wall of windows in their living room. Unfortunately, the entire wall could not be removed as it was load-bearing. So their contractor took down as much of the wall as possible but was still able to make a space that is great for entertaining.</span></p>
<h3>Kitchen islands provide staging space</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating a center island in kitchen design has long been popular, and for good reason! Kitchen islands provide a large meal prep area, as well as space for guests to gather around. Kitchen islands are great for storage, too. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowner and frequent party host, Dawn,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included a center island in her recent kitchen remodel for exactly these reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="Image of a large peninsula in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner,” says Dawn (<em>above</em>). “With a much bigger peninsula, we confine the prep/cooking work to one half of the surface while making room for an attractive presentation on the other.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/west-village-nyc-condo-renovation-nyc-enters-new-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-large-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-50484 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1.jpg" alt="white kitchen island in a large kitchen with white cabinets and light brown over head cabinets after renovation" width="2500" height="1667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1.jpg 2500w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/west-village-nyc-condo-renovation-nyc-enters-new-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil and Ilene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also wanted a kitchen island included in their Sweeten renovation plans. It was important to “make smarter use of the space…and be flexible for when their children and grandchildren visit.” Mission accomplished.</span></p>
<h3>Get the appropriate appliances</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48923 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg" alt="Image of a small entertainment kitchen" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When renovating, you have to divide your must-have vs. your nice-to-have design elements. And, if you love entertaining, you know it’s all about the food. Even though their kitchen was only 70-square-feet, Sweeten homeowners and avid cooks </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/one-bedroom-renovation-chelsea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla and Jesse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) made it their focus to include full-size appliances. That meant a 30-inch stove, a large refrigerator,<em> and</em> a dishwasher. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge),” says Kayla. With their new entertainment kitchen, the couple can create their favorite dishes for friends and family more easily.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44787 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Image of a chef-friendly galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also avid cooks, wanted a chef-friendly redesign for their galley kitchen. But unlike a lot of homeowners, they wanted to keep the layout. Daniel considers the galley configuration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchens are tight spaces, so, it helps to thoroughly plan every square foot before starting a remodel. Kitchens also are complex spaces where many elements must meet code. Supply and drain pipes compete with wires, ducts, and cabinets. The kitchen is not the place for last-minute, informal planning. Where should you start when considering different kitchen layout ideas? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Simply: homeowners should consider using the most common layouts found in kitchens. There are many benefits of starting with a tried-and-true layout in your kitchen: smooth traffic flow, and less wasted space. Additionally, kitchen functionalities</span><span class="s2">—sink, stove, fridge, and dishwasher—will end up in sensible places. Ultimately, this saves money for routing plumbing and electrical work. </span>Below you&#8217;ll find renovations by Sweeten homeowners with kitchen layout inspiration.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Island kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen with black island and ceiling height storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Anthony and Jeremiah&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/plywood-kitchen-is-loaded-with-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen island renovation</a></span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An island kitchen layout combines <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen island with other layouts</a>. These may be an L-shaped, U-shaped, or one-wall kitchen layout. The kitchen island is separate from the main counter area.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many kitchen islands are counters only, with no water or cooking action. If a service is added to the island, it’s usually a cooktop. Large island kitchens may have a cooktop and a second sink for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands may be used less frequently than the owner had originally imagined. So, it helps to add one of those services as a magnet. Or, some homeowners extend one end of the island for use as an eating bar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Additional counter space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Less expensive (you can even use a mobile island)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to bring water supply and drainage to an island<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Takes up a lot of space, so a large kitchen is required</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">U-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-30373 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" alt="u-shaped kitchen with gray cabinets and marble waterfall peninsula" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-shaped kitchen</a> remodel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A U-shaped kitchen layout expands the L-shaped layout by adding an extra wing. Instead of two counters, the U-shaped kitchen has three counters arranged like a U.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the U-shaped kitchen, various functions can be better spaced out than with the L-shaped layout. So, the leg of the L-shape that has the fridge, sink, and dishwasher can be broken up. The U-shaped kitchen’s third leg might contain the fridge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For a U-shaped kitchen, you’ll need to have enough floor space available, but not too much. If the space is too small, the kitchen is cramped. If it’s too large, it takes longer to walk from one area to another. The <a href="https://nkba.org/"><span class="s3">National Kitchen + Bath Association</span></a> recommends that no leg of the work triangle be less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the third wall<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Spreads out kitchen services<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficulty correctly sizing the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Center must be kept free of obstacles<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">One-wall kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Kitchen with blue cabinets and chevron backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tiffany and Chad&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/two-tone-blue-and-white-kitchen-has-first-class-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-wall kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the one-wall kitchen layout, all of the kitchen tasks are combined on a single counter against one wall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since they are all in a line, design is mainly a matter of deciding the order of the functionalities. Usually, the sink and dishwasher are next to each other to share the water supply and drain lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Of the 6 kitchen layout ideas, the U-shape works perfectly for smaller homes such as condos or apartments. However, you’ll want to keep the layout fairly short. This avoids too much movement from one end to the other end.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Squeezes kitchen into tiny space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Keeps plumbing and electrical in one area<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Too much walking if the layout is long<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Little counter space<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Galley kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheilaja + Sergio&#8217;s renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens have two counters that run parallel to each other. The counters are divided by a single aisle. Galley kitchens’ namesake is the kitchen found on boats. True to the inspiration, the aisle is usually narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With galley kitchens, often one leg is devoted to the stove or cooktop and counter space. The other leg is usually the home’s exterior wall and has the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens do a great job of confining the workflow to a tight space. Just make sure that the cabinet, fridge, dishwasher, and oven doors don’t conflict with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Tucks kitchen away, off to the side<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short traffic pattern<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Poor layout for multiple people in the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Doors may conflict or open into each other<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Peninsula kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20126 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg" alt="peninsula kitchen layout with see-through kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dalal + Frans&#8217; renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A peninsula kitchen layout is a U-shaped layout that has a counter extension. Located at either end of the U shape, the extension partially juts into the kitchen. The result is generally a G-shape.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This kitchen usually retains its activities in its U-shaped section. The extension then becomes a breakfast bar or eating counter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The outer part of the extension can take two or three chairs for eating. The inner (kitchen side) is less functional. Most of it becomes a blind-corner cabinet that’s difficult for storing items. One solution is to install a lazy-susan, swing-out, or pull-out in that corner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the end of a run of cabinets<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Room for eating saves on the need for chairs and table<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Creates another blind-corner cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short counter<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No matter the size of your home, there’s a kitchen layout that&#8217;ll fit the space. Keep in mind the kitchen activities that are important to your lifestyle, plot the best layout and flow, and get ready for your dream cook space.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">L-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22344 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="white L-shaped kitchen with black and white floor tile" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda&#8217;s renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An L-shaped kitchen layout has two counters laid at a 90-degree angle to each other. Often, one counter is longer than the other counter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The L-shaped kitchen layout usually divides the kitchen activities across the two legs of the L-shape. One leg may have the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher. The other leg may have the stove or cooktop, plus a majority of the counter space for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons that an L-shaped kitchen layout is a good idea for your home.<span class="s1"> For one, L-shaped kitchens are flexible enough to fit in kitchens of different sizes. For another, this layout lends itself perfectly to the <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kitchen-triangle-best-way-to-design-a-kitchen"><span class="s3">concept of the kitchen triangle</span></a>. With this, the sink, stove, and fridge are arranged in a triangle for better workflow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Flexible, works for many kitchens<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Good use of the kitchen triangle<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Large kitchens can get too spread out<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to find space for counter eating</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Start with the right kitchen layout ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">Cooking in a space with the right floorplan can prove to be the result of a well-planned kitchen remodel. With workflows in mind, everything from preparing ingredients to cleaning up can be done in a more streamlined fashion. The &#8220;work triangle” reduces the number of steps needed to move between the appliances. By having the right design, you are on your way to an enjoyable cooking experience.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen layouts</h3>
<h4><b>How to design a kitchen layout?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing the right kitchen layout is dependent upon the homeowner and the home. When choosing a kitchen layout, the homeowner first has to recognize what space they are working with. They should also think about what they need in their kitchen, and what will be the most useful to them. Would it be best for the kitchen to have an open layout? Or, should it include an island or peninsula? The homeowner has to think of the pros and cons, but also what is actually possible. A small galley kitchen is not going to fit a big island, while a big L-shaped kitchen might look empty without one.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is the best layout for a small kitchen?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-wall layout</a>, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula layout</a> work all well for small kitchens. A galley kitchen can be tucked away in tight spaces, and there is a short traffic pattern. Including a peninsula in the kitchen means that there does not have to be room for a table and chairs. Stools can be added to the peninsula in order to make a tabletop. A one-wall kitchen layout makes it so everything in the kitchen can be compact on one side, and may open up into a living area. </span></p>

<h3>Deciding to renovate during COVID</h3>
<p>What do you do when a global pandemic hits in the middle of your home remodel—just as you’ve moved out of your house, with two babies under two years old in tow, to make way for the construction crew? Jaime Ray Newman washed her hands and pushed on.</p>

<p>“We were juggling a lot,” said the actor and producer, who had posted her project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in 2019 for the dream redo of her 1936 ranch home. “We were expecting our second baby. It was now or never to blow open and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redo the house</a>.” The Sweeten post stated a desire to “convert our old 1930s two-car <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage to ADU</a>,” also known as an accessory dwelling unit, (also known as a working studio, guest apartment, or multitasking hybrid.)</p>
<p>Jaime also hoped to do a space-reclaiming opening of her family’s living space. She shares it with her life and business partner Guy Nattiv, a filmmaker (they co-founded New Native Pictures and won an Academy for &#8220;SKIN&#8221;), their daughters Alma and soon-to-be Mila, and their dog, Kiwi. The project had been on her To-Do list forever.</p>

<p>“We’d been wanting to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert our garage since day one</a>,” Jaime said, “but had struggled with the permitting situation.” The area where they live in L.A. required single-family homes to have two-space covered parking. When the law changed, Jaime recalled, “We said, Let’s do this.” They decided to renovate the house at the same time. “We realized that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan, and a real closet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bath</a> for ourselves,” she said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46473 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg" alt="Jaime Newman" width="1000" height="1374" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-218x300.jpg 218w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-600x824.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The home &amp; garage renovation team takes shape</h3>
<p>Jaime, whose work includes winning an Oscar as a producer, playing a recurring character Elizabeth Manwill in Hulu’s <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> miniseries, as well as an essential district attorney role in Fox&#8217;s <em>Deputy</em>, had already gathered a reno dream team. “I bribed our dear friend Marcos Ferraez, a total visionary when it comes to imagining and reconfiguring a space, to come over and walk through the house,” she said. “We thought we needed to blow out the back of the house and add square footage, but we didn’t have the budget. I was stumped. Marcos completely reimagined our home within our current square footage.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going. But we were in desperate need of an office&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage space</a> was next. Jaime hired <a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer Haley Weidenbaum</a> to conceive of the layout and was stunned by Haley’s ability to maximize every square inch of the available 350 square feet. Haley also had a vision for the main living space, designing the primary bedroom and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. “Her talent and advice were invaluable,” Jaime said. From there she got on Sweeten and found her general contractor.</p>

<h3>Keeping family together during COVID</h3>
<p>Jaime was pretty clear on what she wanted. “I met with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple contractors</a>. What I liked most about the one we hired was that he had style. His taste was always on point,” she said. “He was also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very reasonable, and confident</a>.”</p>
<p>Like most of the world, the family had no idea of the uncertainty that lay ahead. For Jaime, in particular, early 2020 packed a punch. The COVID-19 threat loomed over the U.S. and then, she said, “my dad passed away in February.” Jaime wanted to support her mother and stay close by. It added up to difficult timing. “Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going,” she said. “But we were in desperate need of an office, and a separate space away from the kids so we could get work done,” Jaime said.</p>
<h3>Two designers for a Los Angeles garage remodel</h3>
<p>The project seemed to thrive on flux and change. “I realized at one point that much of our furniture no longer worked with the space, so we sold a lot of stuff on Facebook Marketplace to make room for new things,” she said. When Haley, who had started EVERHEM, a window-treatment company, got too busy and had to step away from the project, they brought in another designer.</p>

<p>“I have always had an Instagram crush on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madelynnfurlong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design consultant Madelynn Furlong</a>,” Jaime said. “I asked if she’d be game to take us to the finish line and re-think the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design of the house</a>. Her aesthetic is unique and she finds the most interesting pieces.” Through Madelynn, Jaime discovered amazing companies like Muuto, Industry West, Lulu and Georgia, Constance Guisset, and Hudson Valley Lighting, among others. And the designer knew how to find one-of-a-kinds.</p>
<p>“Madelynn sent me a link to a giant, vintage burl wood dining table on Chairish for a terrific price, and said “BUY THIS NOW,” Jaime remembers. “It weighs 600 pounds. When it arrived, the household was blown away. This work of art will be passed down to my kids!”</p>

<p>Collaborating with two designers with very different feels was the most fun and satisfying part of the process, according to Jaime. Through them (and Pinterest), she found the original pieces and touches she wanted to make the space her own. Especially bath and kitchen design ideas. “I wanted something fun for our kitchen backsplash and I’m obsessed with Fireclay Tile, so that was easy! The bathroom floor needed to be non-slip, so we picked a slate from Clé Tile that we loved. I also fell head over heels for a hexagon tile from Popham Design.</p>

<h3>What does renovating feel like?</h3>
<p>Asked about a renovator’s most important virtue, Jaime chose patience. The process is long, she said, but your memory is short once you are settled in. “It’s kind of like after having your first baby!” the actor jokes. Confidence is also key, she said. These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts. And <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a> whose aesthetic you love.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad we lived in the house for years before renovating it, so we understood our needs and how best to accommodate them within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a>,” Jaime said. Especially now, during COVID, she says, “We are in pure bliss here. The house is unique, but warm and inviting, a family compound and a comfortable respite. I cannot wait until we can have guests over!”</p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45098 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45113 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="Yonkers family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>
<div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen with natural wood cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg" alt="Bertazzoni stove" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45106" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen storage ideas" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45100" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Balancing the kitchen structures</h3>
<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48250" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Brown drip dishware" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-45099 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="wainscot bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45093 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>

<h3>Flexibility within the renovation</h3>
<p>Due to the building’s landmark status and paper-thin walls, condo approvals were a lengthy process. Once they were complete, the renovation itself took two months. Their contractor encouraged them to keep cooking as a focus, meaning no TV in the kitchen and leaving the &#8220;binge-fests for the den.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Finding something modern</h3>
<p>The couple eagerly agreed on a modern look mixing closed cabinets and open shelves while pairing white and gray shaker-style cabinets with custom black walnut slabs. In the L-shaped kitchen, one of the black walnut slabs acts as a desktop in a built-in—a workspace ideal for her husband, who is usually up before dawn checking email.</p>

<h3>What to splurge and save on</h3>
<p>A white subway tile backsplash with dark gray grout and white quartz counters serve as a simple backdrop. The couple also used brass hardware to add a modern touch. They also planned to splurge on quality countertops, which are known for their durability. To afford this, the couple decided to pass on a highly-desired farmhouse sink for a more affordable stainless steel sink. Durability was a priority for the couple. “This kitchen was built to be used,” said the homeowner. With its greatly increased prep space and extended bar seating, we couldn’t agree more!</p>

<h3>Hosting in their renovated kitchen</h3>
<p>After hosting their first dinner party in the space, she received a thank-you from a friend who said, “I could spend all my days in that kitchen.” The hostess’ response: “And that’s exactly our plan.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitzie and Jenifer bought their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-bedroom apartment in DUMBO</a>, they knew that a full home renovation was needed before moving in. A designer, Mitzie immediately started sketching out design plans and reached out to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who could bring those plans to life. In the home renovation tips below, Mitzie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares the couples&#8217; bedroom and kitchen renovation inspiration, and their experience working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten general contractor</a> to improve the lighting in their new apartment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:05)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our home. My name is Mitzie Wong. I live here with my partner Jenifer Harmon, who is a media executive. I&#8217;m a painter, designer, and co-founder of <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roar + Rabbit</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:35)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the apartment feel very casual, yet luxurious. We had a budget in mind, so we were really careful about choosing the materials. We wanted it to feel very inviting and relaxing.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_41443" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-image-41443 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg" alt="kitchen and living room, kitchen renovation, living room renovation, home renovation tips for kitchen and living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-caption-text">Photos by Kate Glicksberg for Sweeten</p></div>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 1: </strong>A waterfall island brings living spaces together</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:53)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we saw the kitchen initially, it was very boxy. There were lots of angles, the cabinets were jutting out, the counters were short and narrow, so we wanted to make the place a lot more cohesive. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went for a bigger island</a>, deeper with the cascading waterfall marble sides, so it would be a feature because it&#8217;s an open plan to the living room. And we unified everything by color. Being an open plan, it had to be a feature. We hid the freezer and the fridge behind the same colors as the cabinet to make it more unified. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg" alt="home renovation designs, home renovation sketches" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used the same hardware on the drawers and the doors to make it more cohesive, to give it a lighter and brighter space, and we obviously brought the counter forward to give it more a generous sense of space. Because everything was so new looking, I wanted to put in a handmade tile to just soften it up, to give it some texture and some depth.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41431 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg" alt="bedroom, bedroom renovation, home renovation tips for bedrooms" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 2: Turn a plain wall into a colorful headboard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (01:58)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a fairly new building, it&#8217;s only 12 years old, so we wanted to give the apartment some character. As you&#8217;ll see, there&#8217;s a lot of build-outs and recesses and weird angles in each corner. I wanted to take the focal point away and make a feature wall. I used two-and-a-half-inch plywood beams and painted it to make an accent wall to give it layered depth. If you look slightly to the right, you&#8217;ll see the Manhattan bridge, and it&#8217;s a gray-blue, so that was part of the inspiration for the color.

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 3: </strong>Streamline storage and lighting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (02:40)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We relied on our Sweeten contractor heavily on their expertise for lighting. They dropped the ceilings only two or three inches, and we were able to put in the recessed lighting in both the living room and the office, so we could maintain consistent lighting throughout the day and evening. When we were doing the initial renovation during the gutting stage, there was an additional six inches in the wall [of the master bathroom] that was revealed, so we were able to design together and build a bespoke cabinet.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considered the most popular cabinets, kitchen islands and kitchen peninsulas are a beacon for every working cook space. Jockeying for square footage, countertops usually lose space to the sink, appliances, and small appliances. However, kitchen peninsulas and islands will do more than create an additional work surface and storage. They are an immediate focal point and you&#8217;d be hard-pressed not to immediately perch for coffee or for a chat. They also house</span><span class="s1"> amenities such as second sinks, cooktops, dishwashers, or wine coolers.</span></p>

Here&#8217;s our summary of the benefits, costs, and logistics involved in choosing these popular features.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Basics of the kitchen island and kitchen peninsula</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands are detached from the main section of counters and cabinets. Homeowners sometimes supplement this main section with mobile kitchen islands or carts. But true, cook-ready kitchen islands are permanently secured to the floor. Here, the kitchen island becomes a part of the kitchen itself</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">an enhancement that helps the </span><span class="s3">home’s resale value. </span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Kitchen peninsulas offer storage and countertop room roughly similar in size to kitchen islands. They are secured to the floor for functionality and safety. One end is attached either to the wall or to existing counters and cabinets. </span></li>
<li><span class="s1">In most cases, the peninsula stylistically matches the main counters/cabinets. One popular layout is to attach the cabinet to the end of an L-shaped kitchen countertop. It becomes a U-shaped layout. <br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Benefits of the kitchen island designs</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Flexible spacing: </b>This type of cabinet should remain within basic spacing parameters. But within those parameters is a degree of flexibility that allows you to nudge the island to the spot that works best for you.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Instant social space: </b>If you host parties or dinners, or if you just want to draw family members closer, a kitchen island is a people magnet.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Easy to mix styles: </b>All cabinetry and counters typically match. But if you choose to incorporate a slightly different style, this is possible. The physical separation from the main area means that dissimilar cabinets and counters are less noticeable.<br /></span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Benefits of the kitchen peninsula</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Continuous countertops: </b>This type of cabinet typically connects with the main countertop. Quartz and solid surface countertop technicians employ seaming methods that erase the line between the two, effectively transforming them into a single surface.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Better workflow: </b>Continuous counters and cabinets tend to get more use than separate work centers.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Easier to place utilities: </b>Natural gas, electricity, water supply, and drainage lines are easier to connect, since one end abuts a wall or existing cabinets.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Which style works for your space?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Is increasing kitchen storage an overriding concern? If so, a kitchen island may be your best choice. A peninsula has a 90-degree cabinet angle creating a type of dead zone called a blind cabinet. While this space <i>can be</i> used, it is difficult to access. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, kitchen island designs provide an unimpeded storage area under the countertops. If you think that you will want to eventually change or expand your kitchen, consider a kitchen island. It is easier to remove without affecting the main counter/cabinet section.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have a small kitchen or a medium-sized space, choose a peninsula that is more efficient with space. Also, if you think that the kitchen island’s detachment from the main area may deter use, then you should consider installing a kitchen peninsula.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Space requirements</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The choice of a kitchen peninsula or kitchen island depends on the size and layout of the room. Adequate space between work centers must be maintained both for workflow and for safety. You must be able to open cabinet doors and dishwashers. You must also be able to freely access sinks and cooktops.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The industry group </span><span class="s5">National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) recommends that you keep 42 inches of space between the edge of an island or peninsula and any other counters, work centers, appliances, or walls. Increase that width to 48 inches if you expect to have more than one cook regularly working in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Walkways that are <i>not</i> work aisles (pass-throughs behind an island, for instance) should be no less than 36 inches wide.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Whether for an island or a peninsula, think in terms of an imaginary “kitchen triangle” created by three points: sink, refrigerator, and stove or cooktop. The three legs of the triangle should total no more than 26 feet, with no leg measuring less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Standard countertops rise 36 inches above floor level. If either the peninsula or island is intended to be a breakfast bar, that height may be raised to 42 inches (though it would then be used exclusively for eating, not for food preparation).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Electrical receptacles servicing all counter areas should be GFCI-protected (ground fault circuit interrupter).</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Cost considerations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost of adding either cabinet type is highly variable. Since countertop materials tend to be expensive, Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor Claud</a> said that homeowners need to think about whether they want either style to have enough countertop overhang to serve as an eating area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Concerning costs, Claud says that where you live is as important as what you&#8217;re building. &#8220;A detached single-family home will be different from a condo or townhouse, where costs can skyrocket.” He noted that HOAs often require that remodel plans be drawn up by an architect, even in the case of adding either of these features.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Claud estimated that a 5-foot long, 36-inch high peninsula or island using semi-custom cabinets and quartz or solid surface countertops and with no amenities will cost $2,500 to $3,000. Amenities such as a sink or dishwasher add significantly. </span></p>
<h3>Which is more expensive: a kitchen island or kitchen peninsula?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They&#8217;re close, he said, with islands usually costing slightly less. Peninsulas often demand more patching and wall work than islands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Design professionals rarely consider either an island or a peninsula to be inherently better than the other. Instead, it is a matter of your home, the available space within the kitchen, and your taste and desires. Either way, you’ll be gaining the kitchen’s most efficient workhorse in workspace and storage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, discuss with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your Sweeten general contractor</a> which cabinetry works best in your space. </span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639640440727"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a kitchen peninsula?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A kitchen peninsula is an extended countertop area that offers valuable seating and storage space in the kitchen. They are secured to the floor for functionality and safety, with one end attached either to the wall or to existing counters and cabinets. Because kitchen peninsulas protrude from cabinets, they provide space to tuck chairs or stools. In most cases, these cabinets stylistically match the main counters/cabinets to which they are attached.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639640457489"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a kitchen island?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A kitchen island is a standalone structure made of cabinets and a countertop, detached from the main section of counters and cabinets in the kitchen. Sometimes, homeowners use mobile kitchen islands or carts, while more avid at-home chefs opt for kitchen islands that are permanently secured to the floor. Kitchen islands provide a social gathering space, offer flexible styling, and have slightly more spacing options than peninsulas.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A 1960s East Hampton kitchen renovation</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ann was looking for a contractor for over two years to renovate the kitchen in her East Hampton, New York, home. She just couldn’t find the right fit—price-or-quality-wise. Her dark and dated kitchen, in a one-story house built in 1964, had a faux brick backsplash and the original cabinetry. It just wasn’t cutting it for Ann, a big entertainer, with lots of family members who love to come over and cook. However, after finding Sweeten and reading other renovation stories on the blog, she made a move and </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her kitchen renovation project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with an East Hampton contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who’d help turn the old-fashioned kitchen into host-worthy space.<br />
</span></p>

Daniel drew up the plans for an open kitchen, including removing the wall between the dining area and cook space and lifting the ceiling to a cathedral style (which was the contractor’s suggestion). Fortunately, those changes had a dramatic effect on the brightness and size of the room. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner wanted a very timeless aesthetic. Flat-paneled white cabinets set the foundation for the classic look, complemented by white, taupe, and black granite countertops and gold cabinet hardware. Lighting above the island and the black-and-gold sink faucet echo the metallic hardware, tying it all together.</span></p>

As a first-time renovator, Ann was happy to have Sweeten Client Services available throughout the project. “It was great to know somebody was there for you,” she shared. She also had a great time working with her contractor, who encouraged her to take time picking out the materials. Above all, he told her to not rush it—a renovation is not something that’s done every day. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2UW0nGOQ_M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patience was Ann’s main focus from the very start, since she waited to find a contractor she felt confident in. The homeowner suggests that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">future renovators do the same: shop around, speak with as many people as you can, and do research. This isn’t a process worth speeding through!</span></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With one partial wall separating the living area and kitchen, Jennifer had her heart set on creating a seamless, or wall-less, space. Upon inspection, the couple learned the entire wall couldn’t fully come down because it was loadbearing. Instead, their contractor left a little under three feet of the wall remaining—a perfect spot for the refrigerator.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZViC8qWml4U&amp;feature=youtu.be"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40877" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In place of the knocked-down wall came a marble waterfall island with a deep black base and white veins. The rest of the kitchen&#8217;s palette picks up from the marble, juxtaposing the two colors. Glossy black drawers are on one side of the island, while all-white upper and lower cabinetry, plus a white quartz countertop make up the rest of the cooking space. Since the whole concept revolved around clean lines, the renovators chose sleek, linear hardware for their cabinets and installed the microwave drawer underneath the counter to keep the surface clear. Not one detail was spared, from the under cabinet lighting to the textured backsplash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of attention was consistent throughout the project. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edgewater contractors</a> kept them involved in the process from start to finish. “Nothing was done without a full explanation or our understanding,” she said. “They made recommendations that were incredibly helpful and rather than feeling as though our arm was being twisted they helped us to make better decisions with their guidance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Communication</a> is one of the most crucial parts of any project, which Jennifer and Joe can definitely attest to. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly checked in and inquired as to our level of satisfaction. They asked us what stages of our project timeline we were in and it felt nice knowing that they were providing an open line of communication with us,” Jennifer shared. The couple has been through multiple renovations, so knew to brace themselves for problems, but fortunately didn’t encounter them.</span></p>

It is just the best.” </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Jennifer’s tip for future renovators? “Sign contracts that give you a firm start date, end date, and the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a> they will commit to. Our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors were absolutely exceptional</a> in each of these areas. A contract that you can all live with and by is essential.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Gina, a product director, and Dan, who works in account and finance, moved into his childhood home in Media, Pennsylvania, after relocating for a new job and learning they were going to start a family (their son Jack is now 2 years old). Dan’s parents were planning to retire and head south, so the couple rented their 1950s traditional brick, split-level home for a few years. It gave them time to think about the work they’d complete if they decided to make it their own. When they did buy it, the first-time homeowners had a renovation vision underway for the old-fashioned kitchen. The layout wasn’t ideal for entertaining or cooking, and they wanted to increase the square footage, too. “We wanted a bright, open kitchen that was traditional but with clean, modern touches,” Gina shared. The duo <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their Media kitchen renovation project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

Instead of having a traditional table and chairs, we wanted to have stools all around the table where people could casually gather,” Gina said. Plus, they still have a separate dining area on the lower level of the home in what was once a living room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take advantage of their much larger kitchen, the renovators decided against installing upper cabinetry. Ceiling-height cabinets surrounding the two-door refrigerator and island drawers offer more than enough storage.</span></p>

Sweeten matched Gina and Dan with a general contractor they felt comfortable with and worked hand-in-hand with them to first come up with a plan and then execute it. As a former project manager, Gina especially appreciated the contractor’s detailed timelines that laid out when each renovation step would occur. “They set up times for each task and ended up wrapping things up earlier than expected. They took whatever extra time they had and tried to get other things done based on the project, which really helped keep everything on track,” she shared.</span></p>

I think it’s very rare anyone ever has that reaction to a kitchen renovation,” Gina said.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the summer of 2017, Brooke and Paul closed on a 1924 Mediterranean-style home in Pelham, New York. The couple, already living in town, was drawn to the location of the house, perched on a picturesque hillside cul-de-sac in a neighborhood full of young families like their own. The property was designed by architect Guy Mariner, who arrived in Pelham in the early 20th century, making his mark on the suburb&#8217;s historic residential homes and landmarked structures. Their &#8220;new&#8221; old home featured exposed oak beams, beautiful archways, and a barrel-tiled roof—not to mention original faience tiles and leaded-glass windows. The space was almost perfect for them, their kids—Charlotte, Francie, and Teddy—and their two black Labs, Hattie and Reed. There were a few changes that needed to be made to accommodate their busy daily routine.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Their previous home had an expansive, open kitchen with a large island that encouraged casual family gatherings, and it was the go-to spot for baking, art and crafts, and Play-Doh sculptures. In this new house, the kitchen was closed off from the dining room and had lower ceilings. The cabinetry was warped, and the island was “too small for our family of five to gather around,” Brooke explains. The design choices in the kitchen did not match the rest of the house, and the duo wished for an aesthetic befitting the historic architecture of the home while addressing the practical and busy lifestyle of an active family. &#8220;We wanted to create a kitchen that would be functional for everyone to be in without feeling crowded,&#8221; she said. Additionally, the master bath needed a major facelift: a pedestal sink provided no storage and the ancient tub had to go. The pair <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. They were quickly matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>, who they asked to design and install the kitchen, along with a new vanity in the master bath.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooke and Paul embarked on the renovation process without having first lived in the home, which presented some challenges. They weren’t sure how they would use the space, but they did know that they wanted adequate storage, a more open kitchen/dining area, and a large island. Their Sweeten contractor took this information and came up with a solution that incorporated their wishlist. First, they took down the wall separating the dining room and the kitchen and added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large island</a> in its place. “It was also very important to me to have an island that curved out so that when we gathered around to eat, we weren’t in a straight line,” says Brooke.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/kitchen-renovation-cost-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32996 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-1-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the age of the house, the ceiling in the kitchen was quite low and not level. They would have lost two inches if they attempted to level the entire surface. The solution: their contractor carefully integrated the cabinets within the out-of-level areas and cut the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moldings</a> in a certain way to give the appearance of an even ceiling. Brooke tells us, “I struggled with designing a kitchen that I hadn’t lived in before, but our Sweeten contractor was great to work with; he blended my suggestions into his designs and I’m thrilled with how it turned out.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt10.gif" alt="renovator Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple also chose to install a microwave drawer (a favorite), an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extra-large fridge</a>, and two refrigerator drawers just for beverages. Brooke reports that she loves her blue patterned tile backsplash, a splurge that really embraces the Mediterranean architecture of the home. She went with marble for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>; after examining other options, she couldn’t find a substitute that would give the feel she was looking for. A soft gray paint complemented the white cabinetry and blue island. The configuration of the new kitchen, which not only combined the dining room but also opened up the existing butler’s pantry, created a better flow and an easier space for the family to congregate. A custom L-shaped dining bench, topped with cheerful blue and yellow pillows, was the final touch to a warm, happy space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bath, their Sweeten contractor was tasked with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a vanity</a> that could hold a laundry hamper as well as toiletries and other daily necessities. He worked with the small footprint, since moving the plumbing fixtures would have meant going over budget. In the end, however, Brooke and Paul took about a foot from an adjacent bedroom to fashion a slightly larger space. The new vanity is topped with marble and utilizes all the space available. A walk-in shower with pebbled tile floors replaced the old tub, and a bold custom blue paint was the final touch for a fresh new space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, Brooke shares one of her major lessons learned: Paint colors never look the way you expect them to. “I had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, ‘I didn’t know you were going green in the kitchen.’ So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32997 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Westchester County renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-2-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marrying an old house with modern life also meant taking time to figure out how the family wanted to live and use the space. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t been in our home for six months yet, so there&#8217;s still movement in how and where I store things as we get settled,&#8221; explains Brooke. During the demolition, they discovered a time capsule buried by previous owners containing a newspaper clipping dating from the first day of the Iraq War, as well as some information about the family and neighbors. And now, their own house history begins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tara and Ryan turn an industrial space into a warm family home</h2>
<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC. When the couple, who now have a 19-month-old son, had a chance a few years ago to buy into the neighborhood, they jumped at it. Despite the architectural details within their newly purchased loft, the space was outdated and a partial wall was used to create the only bedroom in the home. Here’s the story of how Tara and Ryan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> to renovate their 1,200-square-foot co-op apartment.</em></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Tara and Ryan</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, we had the opportunity to buy a loft in a former silk importer warehouse and fell in love with the possibilities. The space showcased several classic neighborhood features, such as cast-iron Corinthian columns, 13-foot tin ceilings, oversized windows, and exposed brick walls. However, it also needed a lot of work. The kitchen and bathroom were dated. The bamboo flooring was uneven. There was no storage and the only bedroom had a divider instead of a full wall. We lived in the space for a few years while we considered our options. Then we got pregnant with our son, Wyatt, so we decided to act fast to make room for our new family addition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-expose the brick</a> along the entire length of the living room wall. It was a similar case in the master bedroom, where we wanted to add an accent wall. The columns and original tin ceiling would be left untouched; we loved their rustic, industrial character. That raw look would contrast with the clean, modern, and white gloss cabinetry in the kitchen and living room built-ins that we wanted. The brands we chose were based on quality, modern aesthetic, and resale value.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were unsure of what to expect when the brick in the living room would be exposed. In addition to finding a few more steam, electrical, and drain pipes than expected, we also uncovered a square archway (the brick wall was a firewall running down the center beam of the building and the arch was a former large doorway from its time as a warehouse). During the co-op conversion, these archways were covered by standard framing and wallboard to separate the apartments. However, the feature was aesthetically unpleasing. We solved the problem by covering the drywall and turning it into a “feature wall” with reclaimed barn siding. Finally, we showcased the wall with down-lit recessed lighting—an idea we got from a movie. To keep the décor minimalistic, we made maximum use of our new storage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> along much of the living room wall are compartmentalized for baby toys, books, media, and our vinyl collection. On the opposite wall sits a desk for paperwork and musical inspiration; Ryan has played the guitar since he was 13 and hopes his son, Wyatt, inherits his passion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen, we essentially kept the same layout. We had looked at several floor plan options that would have potentially altered the kitchen/bathroom layout and location. After exploring those options, we realized moving those “wet” spaces over our downstairs neighbor’s “dry” living room would drastically increase the cost and complexity of our project. We did push the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> out (toward the dining area) about a foot. That improved the ergonomics of the kitchen, particularly when navigating an inconveniently located cast-iron column. We replaced the cabinets, which gave us the flexibility to tweak the functionality, such as replacing the range on the former island with an induction <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. That left room in the island for three rows of deep drawers, which was a much better use of space for storing pans, utensils, and cookware than cabinets. We also found room to add an 18” wine fridge in the island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall and speed oven combination</a> moved to the back wall, formerly dead counter space for a microwave and toaster oven. We did consider whether the column would interfere with the kitchen flow, especially with ovens on the other side. But it ended up working out fine. The high-traffic area (sink, refrigerator, cooktop) is together on one side of the column. The sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator were replaced but stayed in exactly the same locations, requiring minimal plumbing. Even though we added appliances, we gained storage space just by reconfiguring and making better use of the space we had.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-dryer combo unit</a> had been in a column directly facing the kitchen island, a terrible location for laundry for traffic flow—and hygiene. The water heater was directly above the washer-dryer, making the whole section difficult to move. The simple solution was to rotate the units 180 degrees, so that laundry door was accessed next to the bathroom, which made more sense. The water heater was left as is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A big priority was to formally close off the master bedroom. Working with a 100-year-old former warehouse came with some challenges. One was a column near the bedroom. Although it is beautiful, it just happened to get in the way of every floor plan. Working with our architect, we had to be creative in positioning the bedroom walls in a way to maximize their floor space while working around the columns. Using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pocket doors</a> helped solved the problem since the column would have left no room for standard hinge doors. Storage was a priority throughout the loft. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master closet</a> is a wall-sized, reach-in, modular custom closet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the baby’s room, we took some space from the living room to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the second bedroom</a>. Carving out the space was a challenge when constrained by the column, windows, door placement, and not taking too much square footage out of the master. In the end, we were just barely able to segment an 8-foot x 10-foot room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had a clean, modern makeover with oversized floor-to-ceiling marble tiles. The floor plan stayed the same, but we were able to make substantial improvements with a few minor design adjustments. Once we demo’d, we found that the half-height wet wall behind the pedestal vanity was overbuilt and could be moved inward. This reclaimed a few inches of space needed for the new floating vanity. We also framed out a LED-lit, recessed shelf above this wet wall, giving the area more purpose. The medicine cabinet was set inside the wall, saving some airspace. These little adjustments made the wall feel a few inches deeper and between the shelf, floating vanity, and medicine cabinet, it provided a lot more storage. Above the bathroom’s dropped ceiling, and with a lot of maneuvering, we made space for the blower of the new ducted central air system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is common in New York City, our apartment was heated with building-controlled steam heat. Our unit got a disproportionate share of that heat. In frustration, we removed the steam radiator altogether while adding a heating and cooling central air system. We also replaced the worn-down bamboo tiles with new white oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/">hardwood floors</a> throughout the rest of the apartment, <span style="color: #333333;">which we painted a designer white. </span>It keeps the whole space feeling open and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was great in helping us realize our vision. They understood our scope of work and did a great job at pairing us with excellent contractor options. Then, they walked us through the contractor selection process, helping us make an apples-to-apples comparison of the bids. The Sweeten contractor we ultimately chose to work with turned out to be an excellent pick. They became true partners in our process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One tip we want to pass on to future renovators is, if possible, rent a place close by so you can check in a few times a week. We did and were able to do weekly (sometimes multiple times per week) walk-throughs with our contractor. That gave us time to plan, troubleshoot, and exchange creative ideas. They also used software to track all aspects of the project, including timelines, material selections, work pictures<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>all of which was tremendously helpful and well organized, allowing us to complete our project within the planned four months. Sadly, a friend’s renovation that is similar to ours and started at the same time is still going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting part of this process is seeing our vision come to life. And getting storage because babies come with so much stuff!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple’s childhood memories influence a kitchen’s design</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28999 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowners bought their 1940s, two-bedroom co-op—their first as a couple—in Brooklyn a year before they set off on their renovation journey. It had lovely natural light from generous windows and the elevation made for spectacular views of the city, but with a dark, dreary decor and inefficient layout, it wasn’t putting its best foot forward. Although 1,100 square feet is a decent amount of space by NYC standards, the apartment didn’t feel very open, in part due to a cabinet area and wall separating the kitchen from the living room. The small bathroom, with dull tiles that clashed with baby blue walls, also needed a makeover.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout that year of feeling out the space, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple began to dream</a> of the possibilities. They paid special attention to how others in their building had renovated their apartments. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, and the Sweeten blog also provided endless inspiration. When they were ready to jump into the project, they posted on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service connecting homeowners with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landed on a contractor</a> who was able to counsel them through their many options, eventually identifying what mattered most to them in a home. Ultimately, they wanted an open space conducive to both cooking and hanging out in, with extra storage for books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29006 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom01-1-723x542.jpg" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="Before" data-overlay-color="white" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29012 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom03-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29011 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom18.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29013 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom18.gif" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of them grew up with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> and saw it as a design element that people always gravitate toward. &#8220;The island makes cooking together more fun. There&#8217;s more space for meal prep and now we can admire the city skyline view while we pull dinner together,&#8221; she says. Not to be bound by convention, the homeowners decided to separate the range and the oven. The range—replaced by a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>—remained in the same place, but an electric oven moved to the island. The new layout created a work triangle of range, sink, and island for a better workflow. The toe kick space-saver idea was inspired by Martha Stewart. &#8220;As with most things, it turns out Martha was right!&#8221; said the homeowner.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29007 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-723x542.jpg" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="Before" data-overlay-color="white" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29015 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom19-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29034 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom19-1.gif" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom20-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29035 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom20-1.gif" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="1086" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple, who both work in the art world, harnessed their creativity for the project. When they spotted the deep green shade of color on a tile website, they were hooked. Once the backsplash tile was paired with Ikea&#8217;s butcher block and simple white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>, the whole look came together. &#8220;The watercolor tile catches the light beautifully and actually feels like it changes color depending on the time of day,&#8221; says the homeowner. The open shelves played a big role: they held cooking essentials, making cooking easier; unloading the dishwasher was more convenient; bowls in bright colors and plants were displayed adding to the pop of hue; and what better way to show off the green tile?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another bonus was creating drawers under the cooktop to conveniently store pots and pans. Their previous cabinets were shallow at 11.5&#8243;, causing the chipping of many plates when shutting the doors. Deep cabinets were a must.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom was a typical size: small but functional, with a shower/bath combo. There was a debate over whether the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> should stay. Thinking back to previous apartments and realizing neither had ever used the bath was the deciding factor—the tub was out. They used subway tile in a pattern to give the walls some texture. Dramatic gold hardware quickly became a favorite design choice. Their former bathrooms had always had chrome or silver features, but their bold choice of gold paid off.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29005 mb-0 size-chrono" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom17-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep up with an ever-growing collection of books, the couple lined their hallway with built-in bookshelves based on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idea they saw on the Sweeten blog</a> that their own contractor had done. This triggered sacrifices elsewhere; specifically, it meant widening the hallway by about ten inches, which had to come off of the kitchen square footage. The advantage was the hallway also extended past the fridge, giving back a bit more shelf and counter space. With open shelving for the books, the couple installed lights on the top shelf, which more than compensate for the lost light in the hallway from extending the kitchen wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple was in constant contact with their Sweeten contractor throughout the project, talking several times a week and stopping by often to see the progress. It was a little nerve-racking to be spending so much money on something that wasn’t always 100 percent guaranteed to work, like the green backsplash tiles or the gold features in the bathroom. Other final touches, such as &#8220;getting the vent hood in exactly the right spot&#8221; and positioning the towel hangers correctly, were stressful. Their patient contractor, however, coached them through the process and deadlines and if something went awry, helped to get the project back on track. They were very happy with how the renovation turned out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One last piece of advice from the homeowners: &#8220;Measure all your cookware, and then use those measurements to design your kitchen cabinets. It made us feel a little OCD to do this, but it really paid off.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Ainsley and Simon moved into their two-bed, two-bath co-op in Park Slope two years ago, they already knew a kitchen renovation was on the horizon. The dark, almost menacing cabinets that touched the high ceilings made the wrong type of statement. The kitchen island also seemed disproportionately large for the space, doing a half job of making the kitchen and living room seem like two spaces. “It was hard to be in the kitchen and be a part of what was happening in the living room,” said Ainsley. “We wanted it to be more of an open, single space.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Their building, circa 1892, also had some beautiful details, like the wooden trim around the windows, but dark wood features in the existing kitchen drowned everything out.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28114 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a></strong> and used <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></strong>, a free service that connects renovators with construction professionals, to hire a <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a></strong>. After securing an architect, the couple was able to hand a set of drawings to their Sweeten contractor which made for a smooth transition process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27986 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen fridge" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Straight off the bat, their architect came up with the idea to <strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hide the fridge</a></strong> inside a column that was originally thought to be structural, thus immovable. “You don’t look at it and think it is a fridge at all,” said Ainsley. All you see is a handle and a wall.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28116 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Open shelving on the living room side of the kitchen island was swapped out for <strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a></strong> to create a cleaner look. The height of the <strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a></strong> was also dialed down to lessen the divide with the living room. The couple went with a light blue-gray to brighten up the kitchen and now the wood details &#8220;pop&#8221; as they frame the outdoor views. “Lots of grays and lots of blues,” said Ainsley. ”We went back and forth for awhile.” <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Before-02-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27991 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Before-02-Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-09-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28115 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-09-1000px-RETOUCHED-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>This Park Slope co-op kitchen renovation is full of clever design details. From the <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/">paneled refrigerator</a> that blends seamlessly with the adjacent wallpapered wall, to the cutting board drawer next to the microwave. The renovation process went smoothly. Almost, anyway. A delayed material delivery caused a setback, but their Sweeten contractor worked hard to get back on schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27987 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: While the kitchen renovation was in progress, Simon and Ainsley stayed in the Park Slope co-op apartment. They took the opportunity to have a local culinary adventure most nights. “We went to every single restaurant in the neighborhood that we hadn’t been to,” she said.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Rosalind_Kitchen-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26782 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray and white kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Rosalind_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen TV" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Rosalind_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Rosalind_Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Rosalind_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Rosalind_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Rosalind_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Give an outdated kitchen a media nook and more storage in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Rosalind, a business analyst, and her husband, Lawrence, longed to return to Brooklyn after a decade in Long Island. In 2015, they decided to downsize and bought a 100-year-old house in the neighborhood of Cypress Hills. Over time, they renovated two bathrooms, the stairway, and a walk-in closet. “The kitchen was last,” said Rosalind. It was functional, but didn’t suit Rosalind’s taste and the floors were flimsy. “There were holes that had been roughly covered with other flooring,” she said. The limited cabinet space also meant storing larger kitchen equipment, like the slow cooker and cake mixer, in the living room. Rosalind cooks four to five times a week, so heading into the living room to get what she needed grew old, fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors—the couple’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> worked fast and completed the job in five weeks. There were only two weeks where the kitchen couldn’t be used (Rosalind and Lawrence went out to eat a lot). While much of the layout stayed the same, Rosalind wanted to take advantage of the kitchen window that looked out over the backyard, so the kitchen sink was lined up with the window to make washing up more enjoyable. The wooden cabinets, yellow walls, and orange backsplash tiles<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>some with sketches of fruit on them<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>had to go. Instead, Rosalind went with a sleek gray palette with a quartz <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> that looked like marble. The different gray tones she picked meshed perfectly with the hues of gray, as well as sage, in other rooms on that floor of the house. To move the appliances from the living room and into the cook space, the couple added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a>. It now doubles as both <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> and as a gathering point when friends and family come over.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: With plenty of time spent in the kitchen, Rosalind wanted some entertainment. “I like to watch TV while I cook,” she said. The solution: installing a “media station,” which included a 32-inch flatscreen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple who loves to cook creates a waterfall counter as a welcoming perch for friends and family</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26527" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project</span>: Open up a tiny kitchen in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Amy and Nick were looking for a new home and wanted a place that was either move-in ready or didn’t need a lot of work. Things changed when they came across a 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that made perfect sense but needed a complete overhaul, so they decided to buy it and put aside money to make the space their own. The kitchen was outdated and enclosed in a small, triangular-shaped nook in the main living area, while the fridge was awkwardly placed outside of it. Because of the narrow shape of the kitchen, there was limited counter space and no room for lower cabinets. Also, the tile floor in the kitchen didn’t match the wood floor that ran throughout the rest of the living area, a look that made the space feel disjointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: To kick things off, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten and were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The gut renovation began with demolishing the walls that made up the triangular nook to make way for a new layout in the kitchen. All of the old molding throughout the apartment was removed and replaced with crisp new trim. The entire apartment was also skim coated—walls, ceilings, doors, and moldings—and given a fresh coat of paint. Moving the sink meant checking under the floorboards to see if the support beams would allow piping to run in the direction needed to relocate it. Most of the support beams ran in the opposite direction, but luckily they switched direction under the kitchen area, allowing Amy and Nick to install the new sink as planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall counter</a> on the island was fabricated in Calacatta gold marble and continued along the rest of the kitchen prep areas. Amy explained, &#8220;We wanted the kitchen island to be a centerpiece of the room, and we were looking for a surface that was beautiful to fill the space. The Calacatta gold marble slab we chose was the first slab we saw at the stone yard, and we just loved the contrasting veins and its uniqueness. The inspiration for the waterfall was that we wanted to take full advantage of all the beautiful material we had. We also used the leftover marble for the bathroom—it&#8217;s in the vanity, the windowsill, and the threshold.&#8221; The marble also has a honed surface, rather than polished, which helps with wear and tear. To complement the marble waterfall counter and countertops, a large, white elongated <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> was chosen for the backsplash. Storage was added in the form of pre-fab upper and lower cabinets with a glossy, acrylic finish to replace the original wood cabinetry, complete with a custom-made pantry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All new Bosch appliances—dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave—provided a much-needed functional upgrade. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pendant lighting</a> was added over the island and recessed lighting was installed throughout the kitchen and the rest of the living area to brighten up the space. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. &#8220;We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Amy found the backsplash tile on Pinterest and searched online for it everywhere until she came across the manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Larson.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily&#8217;s kitchen</a>, moving the sink to the peninsula not only added some breathing space, it allowed her to extend the length of her cabinets without worrying about having enough clearance below them for washing up.</p>
