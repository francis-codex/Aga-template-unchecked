<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Detailed scopes of work</h3>
<p>&#8220;I was very fortunate to have <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/aleks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aleks and his team</a> work on my apartment&#8217;s renovation. From the start when I met him for the first time, Aleks was friendly, very meticulous, and attentive to details. He proposed options and recommendations for my requirements without being aggressive. Aleks provided me with a very detailed scope of work. Because of this, it only took the property management company of my co-op building 2 weeks to approve the work. They did a full renovation of bathroom and kitchen, refinishing the floors, painting, replacing the closet shelvings and bars, and refinishing the closet doors.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Handling difficult building management</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eli and his team</a> on a kitchen renovation in our co-op. For anyone that has worked or owned a co-op before, you know there can be a lot of back and forth with approvals with the co-op board and management company. Eli was a great partner in getting all of the necessary documentation to the management company, and communicating directly with them when needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Working with the budget</h3>
<p>&#8220;We had a wonderful time working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4137#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a>. As first-time homeowners, we had heard horror stories from friends about unresponsive contractors they had encountered while renovating. Certainly not our experience at all with James. They worked around our budget and helped us understand which items were worth splurging on and where we could cut back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Kris was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16043212],&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris</a> was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much. We had heard so many horror stories from our friends that made us nervous at first—but Kris and his team though were very professional and completed the work on time and on budget. We&#8217;re thrilled with the work they did!&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Leading first-time renovators to success</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/santiago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Santiago</a> was very pleasant and easy to work with. As first-time renovators, we appreciated his patience in answering our 1,000,000 questions. He was very flexible in helping us define a scope for the project that matched our budget and helped us strategize to make our money go the furthest. During the work phase, his team was mindful of the fact that we still lived in the space (with a toddler!) and did their best to minimize disruption to our lives. They also finished on time and on budget!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Consistent, clear communication</h3>
<p>&#8220;Working with <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pellumb (Paul)</a> was hands-down the best renovation decision I made. He has incredible communication skills and kept me informed from start to finish. As an interior designer in the industry for over 12 years, I was pleasantly surprised to meet a contractor with such pride and commitment to his work. His crew was timely and respectful when working in my home. I was lucky enough to go on vacation for 2 weeks towards the end of the project, and when 2 surprise leaks were discovered, the problem was resolved without hesitation. Paul was only a WhatApp message away with pictures and updates of the problem being solved.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Friendly subcontractor teams</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During the construction, we got to know all the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor&#8217;s workers</a> and really enjoyed having them around. (And even know all their personalities and preferred playlists!) They are respectful and diligent. Most importantly, they&#8217;re very experienced and are able to give good suggestions and to make decisions. We lived on-site for the second half of the project. It was definitely messy and frustrating at times, but the crew made it easier for us. We truly appreciated that.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Helping hands for materials &amp; design</h3>
<p class="p1">“From the beginning, <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/paulina-albert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paulina</a> &#8216;got&#8217; what we were looking for: a modern, minimalist aesthetic that is functional for a family. Her creative design of the space, kitchen, closets, and built-ins helped to maximize our space and make our apartment feel much more spacious than the actual square footage would suggest. Our 9-year-old daughter gave her a nearly impossible task to find &#8216;teal and rainbow&#8217; tiles for her bathroom and she found a beautiful iridescent tile that has drawn the admiration of all who have seen it.”</p>
<h3>Keeping a clean worksite</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During the work, I was able to stay in my apartment because <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/meet-sweeten-general-contractors-nina-ilya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ilya and Nina</a> took great precautions to cover everything with plastic so that it wouldn’t be covered with dust. At the end of each workday, the team also cleaned up the workspace, to the extent possible, and stored everything in one, compact space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul</a> and team have been amazing the whole way, and while we did more than half of the work before we moved in, we moved in while the top floor was still being renovated and lived in the space for about 8 weeks during construction. The team was great in keeping the site clean, but we really noticed that they kept the dust and construction contained once we had moved in too!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Problem-solving pros</h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Chris is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver. He was always quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls regardless of time of day. My project was a gut renovation in an apartment that hadn't been occupied for over 6 years. Despite some challenges, including a bathroom so small that a standard sized tub couldn't fit in, a leak discovered by Chris's plumber, and a switch from a gas stove to electric, Chris was able to deliver the project on time and close to the initial proposal. The few change orders were my chosen enhancements to the project - including a custom closet and moving the bathroom pipes closer to the edges of the wall to gain a few inches for the bathroom. Highly recommend Chris. Gut renovations in a New York City apartment co-op are incredibly stressful and Chris was a reliable contractor I trusted to get the job done and appease the board.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16773836},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">&#8220;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5698#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver. He was always quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls regardless of the time of day. My project was a gut renovation in an apartment that hadn&#8217;t been occupied for over 6 years.

<h3>Tackling big projects with ease</h3>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil</a> is great to work with. Our project was massive! New roof, gutters, windows, and siding, to our 95-year-old free-standing house. Plus, we completely gutted and redesigned the basement with upgrades in plumbing and electrical, as well as finding and fixing a leak issue that caused the basement to flood during heavy rains. Doing such a variety of work required tremendous organization, workweeks planned weeks in advance and staying flexible when the unexpected arose. Neil handled each step with patience and humor, and so when each project was finished, we felt happy, confident, and satisfied that the craftsmanship was what we desired and all problems were resolved.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A self-proclaimed millennial&#8217;s first renovation in Midtown East</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sherry, a recent college graduate, was excited to make her family’s rental property in Manhattan into her first home. Once she got a job offer in New York, she knew it was time to remodel the outdated space. The renovation process started with a lot of compromise between Sherry and her then-boyfriend, but over time, evolved into a project all her own. After posting her project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, she chose the one she felt would bring her ideas for each room to life. Here, the journey to the final design of her first major renovation.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35590 mb-10 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, bathroom renovation, vanity, walnut, open storage, round mirror" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> <em>Guest post by homeowner Sherry in Manhattan&#8217;s Midtown East </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My family purchased an apartment in Midtown East during the height of the 2008 financial crisis and immediately turned it into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rental property</a>. While in Connecticut for college, I dreamt of moving to New York and making that apartment my first home. The property hadn’t been renovated since being built in the ‘80s and felt outdated. And there were practical issues to consider, including extensive water damage on the hardwood floors from a tenant who had left the living room windows open for weeks. When I started a job in New York last year, it was time to make my dream into a reality and take the plunge on renovating the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35608 size-full" title="living room before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg" alt="millennial apartment renovation, manhattan renovation, before, living room, sliding doors" width="1084" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg 1084w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35602 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, living room, kitchen, dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, I was planning on moving into the apartment with my now ex-boyfriend and we each had a lot of ideas for what needed to be addressed in the remodel. While I was mostly focused on making aesthetic and design improvements, he thought we needed to change the entire floor plan by moving walls and doorways around. As we were trying to find a compromise, we heard about Sweeten and decided some expertise and personal attention would be helpful in guiding us through the home renovation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with several potential general contractors who could make the changes we wanted within budget. We met with one who spent hours discussing all of our renovation ideas and possibilities in detail. We liked his vision and readiness to tackle the challenges of our space and knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he was the right contractor</a> for us.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35609 size-full" title="living room before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, before, living room, kitchen" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03-232x300.jpg 232w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03-600x774.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35605 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, living room, kitchen, dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we honed in on the details of the remodel, my boyfriend and I spent countless hours debating choices about tile, paint colors, and finishes. I realized the project wasn’t going how I had envisioned and about three months into the process, we broke up. I went back to the contractor and we agreed to scrap the original plan and completely redesigned everything in 48 hours. By the end of those two very stressful (but liberating!) days, we were ready to move forward.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35601 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, kitchen, counter, sink, refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my first priorities was to update the<span style="color: #000000;"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a> throughout the apartment.</span> I knew I needed to address the water damage in the living room and also wasn’t in love with the original floorboards, which were narrow and felt outdated. I wanted to update the space in a more modern and millennial style, which meant making design choices that had a sense of utility while also being simple, sleek, and refined. We installed beautiful, wide, oak floorboards that anchored the space in an elegant way and became the foundation for the rest of my design choices. There&#8217;s a sense of an overall artistic feel leaning toward urban chic (simple, cool tones).</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35599 mb-0 size-full" title="stove" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, kitchen, cabinets, stove, range, stainless steal" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to find ways to enlarge the<span style="color: #000000;"> living room and kitchen </span>as much as possible. We decided to remove a closet near the front door to add space to the living area while slimming the walls around the kitchen to keep it as open as possible. The decor was kept simple with lots of neutral grays and blues, which helped create the illusion of more space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom and bedroom</span>, however, would have strong design statements. In the bathroom, there were two: a beautiful, circular mirror with a beveled, asymmetrical frame that I fell in love with instantly, and the chevron shower tile (that I was inspired to use after looking through past <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten projects</a>!) I couldn’t resist adding two gorgeous sconces next to the mirror and lots of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in storage</a>. My Sweeten contractor helped bring these ideas to life within my budget; I made my choices for the lighting, the mirror, and tiles within the contractor’s app and signed off on each decision.</p>

I chose to build the design around a Nepalese rug I owned, which had earthy tones and hints of red. The contractors customized my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet</a> for me and painted one of the walls a soothing gray to complement the deep hue of my red velvet headboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, my experience with Sweeten and my contractors could not have been more positive! Everyone involved was great about communicating challenges while still striving to make my dream a reality. Now that my cat, Zelda, and I have moved in, it’s such a pleasure to get ready every day in front of my beautiful bathroom vanity and walk on my smooth, new, hardwood floors knowing that I hand-picked every element. Designing your space from top to bottom is something I would recommend to everyone—the sense of satisfaction and pride in your space is well worth all the work involved!</p>
