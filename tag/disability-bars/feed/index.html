<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Make a bathroom accessible and safe in Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Elaine and her family moved into their brownstone in 1981 and the parlor floor bathroom hadn’t been renovated since. Aside from the outdated fixtures and decor, Elaine’s main focus was to make the bathroom suitable for “aging-in-place.&#8221; The bathroom is on the same floor as the kitchen, so if she ever needed to stay on one floor of the home, she’d have everything she required “My plan is to stay in my house as long as I can,” Elaine said. Design-wise, she wanted the bathroom to be clean, crisp, and something she’d never get tired of. Renovating a bathroom she said, “is like buying a sofa; you’re not just going to get rid of it right away.” When she heard about Sweeten and the selection of vetted, licensed, and insured contractors, Elaine <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27214">posted her project</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-tiled-bathroom-with-pink-bathtub"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48856 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown tiled bathroom with pink bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Elaine was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4018">Sweeten general contractor</a> and they clicked instantly. “I could sense that I got along with him very well,” she said. They went to Home Depot together, and he suggested a few stores in Queens with better prices for fixtures and materials.</p>
<p>The bathtub was replaced with a walk-in shower featuring a handicap bar, a separate hand-shower, and a built-in storage nook. Elaine knew she wanted the shower floor to be a little rougher for extra traction, so she opted for a stone-effect material. Even though the bathroom had plenty of space for a separate towel rack, she preferred a clean, clutter-free space with essentials hidden away. The floating vanity provided enough storage for towels, toilet paper, and a hairdryer.</p>

<img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-glass-doors"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48858 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="White bathroom with glass doors and white floating sink and vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Overall, the renovation process went smoothly. When she ordered the wrong size toilet for the existing plumbing, her contractor helped find a new one for the plumbing. Since there weren’t any major changes to the footprint, they didn’t have to go through the NYC Department of Buildings for approvals, either.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-french-window-behind-homeowner"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48869 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="White french windows behind a happy homeowner " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>“I was very fortunate I found the right person through Sweeten,” Elaine said. “I love everything about the bathroom.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Her contractor built a closet for even more convenient (and hidden) storage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>:  Shower tile, shower fixtures, wall and floor tile, and floating vanity: <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decor Planet</a></p>
