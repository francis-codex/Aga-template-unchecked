<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re in the home of interior designer Katherine Hammond to check out the newest addition to her lovely Brooklyn Brownstone. After hearing about us from a friend, Katherine posted on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> seeking a contractor to build the <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom floating desk</a> she had designed. We matched her up with Nick Dillon of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a>, who worked with the designer to build and install her floating-concept desk. When the project was completed, Katherine reported that Nick was a &#8216;dream to work with&#8217; &#8211;and, as a bonus to us, she even ended up becoming a member of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> network with her company <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Hammond Interiors</a>!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6011 size-full mb-24" title="01_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> </a>Here&#8217;s a shot of the space when <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine posted her project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6009"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6012 mb-24 size-full" title="02_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s the transformed space! Katherine&#8217;s desk spans the length of the wall and is built-in for a floating effect, rather than being held up by vertical structural elements. Katherine explained that Nick advised her in the desk&#8217;s structural design, adding 3 thin steel brackets at different intervals across the span of the desk. In the center-back, the desk features a linear opening for cords so that items can be plugged in neatly and also moved from side to side. Beneath the opening, the cords are run through a hollow channel and straight to a power source which was relocated by NKCI for this purpose. These details allow Katherine can keep her desk as cord-free as possible!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6031 mb-24 size-full" title="03_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s Nick Dillon, owner of Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, on site during the desk installation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6014 size-full" title="04_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desk was designed to be tucked away in the alcove behind this headboard. Like much of this Brooklyn Brownstone interior, the headboard, which doubles as a bookcase on the other side, was designed and built by Katherine and her father. Katherine consulted Francois Chambard of <a href="https://umproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UM Project</a>, an innovative furniture design co., for construction detailing to ensure a minimal look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6015 mb-24 size-full" title="05_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> When Nick &amp; his crew came to install the desk (which they built off-site), Nick did his usual, <a href="/2012/06/21/site-visit-w-nick-knacks-creative-interiors-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very meticulous prep-work</a> in order to ensure that none of Katherine&#8217;s belongings were damaged.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6016 mb-24 size-full" title="06_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> We love how clean and minimal the design is &#8211;and while we can only see a glimpse of the desk from around the corner, we can still get a sense of its conceptual lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6017 mb-24 size-full" title="07_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s the designer, Katherine Hammond. Once her desk was in place, Katherine painted a few layers of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic paint primer</a> onto the wall above. Now her inspirations can also float (without damaging the wall!). Covering the magnetic layer is Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-painting-contractors/paint-products/satin-impervo-alkyd-low-lustre-paint#advs=0&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satin Impervo</a>, which was also used on the desk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6029 mb-24 size-full" title="09_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desktop and drawer faces were built with MDF then painted, while the drawer interiors feature the natural grain and texture of finished plywood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6030 mb-24 size-full" title="10_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />We couldn&#8217;t be happier to have found the perfect match for Katherine&#8217;s project! Many thanks to Nick, Dawn &amp; team at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, and to Katherine of Katherine Hammond Interiors.</p>
