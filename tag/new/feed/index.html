<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Fix a crumbling bathroom in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: A prewar apartment’s charm can be a benefit and a curse. In Karun’s nearly century-old co-op bathroom, it was the latter. “I purchased the apartment from a sponsor [the owner who had previously rented out the space]. It likely had never been remodeled and was in desperate need of a makeover,” he said. The wall and floor tiles were cracking, and overall the bathroom didn’t reflect his industrial style. The entire apartment has been in a constant state of renovation since Karun moved in, and he wanted to make sure the bathroom changes matched the raw, exposed vibe of the other rooms. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project to Sweeten</a> and was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-tiles-with-red-trim"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48842 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White bathroom tiles with red trim and sink with vanity before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Karun’s dream of a rugged, yet, refined bath came to life with an eclectic mix of materials and finishes. “I knew exactly how I wanted to do it, and my contractor was able to make it a reality,” he shared. More polished pieces like the Carrara marble sink and brushed bronze hardware balance out his edgier choices, like the vanity and raw cement walls. He included more modern touches too, opting for a wall-mounted faucet over the sink and marble herringbone tile for the floor. His sister built the floating wood shelves and vanity surface from a tree that fell in her backyard, which puts another personal spin on the bathroom.</p>

<img decoding="async" title="gray-door-white-bathroom-and-bathtub"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48845 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Gray door in a white bathroom with white bathtub and herringbone floor tile after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>His Sweeten contractor helpfully suggested modifications to Karun’s original plans, including choosing a contrasting color tile for the in-shower storage niche. Overall, the project went smoothly, though Karun did have to stay with his cousin for a longer time than expected due to plumbing delays.</p>
<p>As a first-time renovator tackling multiple projects, his biggest questions revolved around expected costs. “Estimates vary considerably,” he said. “Sweeten’s platform was invaluable in this respect.”</p>
<p>The bathroom turned out just as he expected. “[It’s] home, sweet, home. There’s nothing like living in a place that’s been customized to your own tastes,” he said.</p>
