			<h2>From granite to quartz, different types of kitchen countertops can deliver on both looks and performance</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-0 size-full" title="Caesarstone countertop in Statuario Maximus" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>Updated on October 14, 2021</em></span></span></p>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, kitchen countertops have the most style impact in the kitchen. There are many types of kitchen countertops to choose from—stone, quartz, solid surfacing, wood, to identify the most popular—so you’ll want to take a few factors into consideration before pulling out your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will it go? Will it be attractive if it’s visible from adjoining living areas as well as the cooking space?</li>
<li>How will you use it and how often? Can it stand up to common spills and daily impact with cooking tools?</li>
<li>What other features will it connect to? Will it look good and stand up to adjoining elements, like a sink or a stovetop?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Besides the after-meal swipe with a sponge, are you up for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking the time for regular maintenance</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, whatever your answers are to the questions above, there is a countertop for you. Today’s eclectic kitchen styles also welcome a mix of materials, so don’t worry about everything matching. You can have one material for the island and another for the countertop, or treat yourself to a small slab of marble for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar space</a>, for instance. For best results, always hire a professional certified to fabricate and install the particular material you choose.</p>
<p>Below are popular kitchen countertops that Sweeten homeowners have installed, along with the pros and cons of each material.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Marble kitchen countertops</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25997 mb-10 size-full" title="Carrera marble countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Image of marble kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Carrara marble kitchen countertops in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Sought for its classic beauty and variety, marble still draws its fans among homeowners who want to have stone in the kitchen. However, it is more porous than granite, and this factor—combined with a high price tag—limits its application to a few areas of the kitchen, like entertaining or baking areas. Remember that this particular material enjoyed pride-of-place in grand homes in the last two centuries, so if you are up for classic elegance that yields a timeworn patina, this could be the stone for you.</p>
<h4>Cost of <strong>marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at more than $100 per square foot (which does not include fabrication)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pros of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withstands high heat</li>
<li>Adds a high-quality, luxury look suitable for traditional or contemporary kitchens</li>
<li>Stays cool, so good for rolling out dough</li>
<li>Pairs beautifully with many other surfaces, especially wood and metal</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The most expensive of stones</li>
<li>Limited in color choices—whites, grays, blacks</li>
<li>Stains, scratches, cracks, and chips more easily than other stones</li>
<li>Requires monthly sealing and may still discolor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soapstone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43650 mb-10 size-full" title="Blue/green soapstone countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg" alt="Image of soapstone countertop and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Soapstone countertops in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Soapstone’s resistance to heat and water, along with a muted color palette marked by subtle veining, makes it an appealing alternative to granite and marble. It also comes with a slightly lower price tag, which is attractive to budget-conscious homeowners. However, soapstone countertops do require care, like all stones.</p>
<h4>Cost of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70-$100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists heat and water</li>
<li>Color tends to be uniform throughout the slab</li>
<li>Suitable for sinks, too, if you want a blended look</li>
<li>Comes in at the lower price spectrum of natural stone</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches easily and will show stains, which can be sanded out</li>
<li>May crack or chip if you aren’t careful when working on it</li>
<li>Requires regular sealing and will show stains if not wiped up immediately</li>
<li>Develops a patina over time, which you may or may not like</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineered stone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of townhouse kitchen with engineered stone counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Engineered quartz countertops by Caesarstone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, engineered stone is probably the toughest surface on the market. This material is typically 90 percent quartz mixed with pigments and polyester resin, then manufactured under pressure into highly dense slabs. Manufacturers such as Caesarstone offer a vast array of looks, including many faux granites as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and some brilliant colors like red and blue. Claims that it won’t stain or fade or succumb to high heat make them <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;popular kitchen countertops&quot;}">popular kitchen countertops</span>, edging out granite, despite the fact that the cost is roughly the same or higher than natural stone.</p>
<h4>Cost of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most impervious of all surfaces; resists heat, stains, scratches, bacteria, fading</li>
<li>Huge selection of patterns and colors, including faux stones and custom colors</li>
<li>Can be manufactured into nearly any shape you want</li>
<li>Requires no sealing or special maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faux stone doesn’t appear to look like real stone</li>
<li>May crack on sudden impact with a heavy object</li>
<li>Costs as much as real stone</li>
<li>Solid-colored slabs will show seams</li>
</ul>
<h3>Granite countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-10 size-full" title="honed black granite countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above) Granite countertops in </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Granite landed on the kitchen scene a little over two decades ago and remains popular. It’s a close second behind the number one choice, engineered stone, according to a survey from the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Why do granite countertops endure? Simply put, they combine unique beauty with durability and low maintenance. The natural grain means no two slabs will be identical. While very hard and impervious to heat, granite is porous, so it needs to be sealed at least annually—easy enough with hand application by sponge.</p>
<h4>Cost of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts around $60-$100 per foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists high heat</li>
<li>Comes in a range of colors and grains</li>
<li>Each slab has a unique appearance</li>
<li>Maintains its value if well cared for, including sealing annually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expensive, but popular colors come in lower prices</li>
<li>Shows wear from knives and spills like vinegar, citrus juice, and oils, so use a cutting board on top</li>
<li>Requires regular maintenance, which a DIY project with a sealant and a sponge can accomplish</li>
<li>Will crack if improperly installed or a heavy object makes an impact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid surface countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49495 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects Can Vu Bui, Lane Rick, and Matthew Storrie&#8217;s kitchen remodel </a></span></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, solid surfacing was the darling in the world of kitchen countertops. It still deserves consideration, as many qualities have been improved over time by brands like <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a>. It is heat- and stain-resistant and comes in a range of looks, including faux stone, and lots of fashion colors. Because it has a little give, due to it being made of acrylic or polyester or a blend of the two, objects dropped on solid surface counters are less likely to break. It also can be molded into many shapes, including intricate inlays, edge and backsplash treatments, as well as furniture.</p>
<h4>Cost of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>$80 to $100 per square foot, depending on the pattern and color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat- moisture-, and fade-resistant</li>
<li>Enormous choice of colors and patterns, including custom</li>
<li>Seams fuse together so joints don’t show</li>
<li>Molds into just about any shape including integrated backsplash or sink</li>
<li>Does not require sealing; clean with mild detergent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can’t take high heat; will lose shape</li>
<li>Vulnerable to scratches, cuts, and prolonged exposure to stains like wine or catsup; requires a cutting board</li>
<li>Faux stone looks don’t exactly resemble stone</li>
<li>Not recyclable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wood countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44120 mb-10 size-full" title="walnut wood countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg" alt="Image of kitchen with wooden butcher block countertop" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Wood countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavanya and Regis&#8217; kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Probably America’s earliest type of kitchen countertop, wood is still desired for its natural beauty and warmth. Wood countertops can take moderate heat, but it will show burns, dings, and knife cuts. Fans consider the patina part of the appeal. Most damage can be sanded out; be sure to reapply food-safe mineral oil after any repair. Avoid installation in areas like the sink with prolonged exposure to moisture, which will cause it to swell. Clean with a damp sponge and a mild detergent. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most commonly used as kitchen countertops, in a butcher-block pattern, which provides additional strength. Another pro of wood countertops: they&#8217;re a thriftier choice than many of the other types of countertops described above.</p>
<h4>Cost of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $35 per square foot; rarer woods can be more expensive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to clean and repair</li>
<li>Good for cutting and chopping; knives won’t dull with contact</li>
<li>Won’t chip and objects dropped on it are less likely to break</li>
<li>Provides a rich look for a price lower than many other kitchen surfaces</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to moisture, chemicals, and high heat, which cause permanent damage</li>
<li>Immediately shows signs of use</li>
<li>Expands or contracts with extreme swings in a moist environment</li>
<li>Requires food-safe sealant and regular care to preserve the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laminate countertops<b></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26004 mb-10 size-full" title="Dekton laminate countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of laminate kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Laminate countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike’s kitchen remodel</a></span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p>While not so rugged as most types of countertops today, laminate countertops still have plenty of upsides. To start, laminate countertops come in loads of patterns and colors and have a thrifty price tag. Made of resin-covered paper backed by plywood or particleboard, laminate does come with its share of synthetics. To ensure your indoor air quality, look for laminate countertops certified by Greenguard, like <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilsonart.</a> This indicates they are made from low-emitting materials that use formaldehyde-free paper and low- or non-toxic glues. This fashion-friendly surface can mimic the look of stone, wood, or fabric, or any graphic the manufacturer can think of. It will last for a few decades with proper care, which includes no direct cutting on the surface or exposure to acid or chemicals.</p>
<h4>Cost of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at $10 to $20 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires minimal care and no sealing</li>
<li>Available in a vast selection of patterns and colors</li>
<li>Easy to cut and install in tight spaces</li>
<li>Well-priced, particularly for a product with so many style options</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and burns easily; sometimes impossible to repair</li>
<li>Seams show, particularly on solid colors</li>
<li>Allows only drop-in sinks, due to their construction</li>
<li>Anything other than the simplest edge treatment will drive up the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stainless steel countertops</h3>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44554 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Image of stainless steel countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Stainless steel countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, stainless steel countertops are commonly used in commercial kitchens. This is because stainless steel can take a beating: from knives, high heat, most spills, and it’s completely anti-bacterial. You must avoid caustic chemicals, but since it’s water- and stain-proof, that’s not an issue unless you use it for something other than food prep. It comes in a number of finishes, including polished and brushed, which help hide scratches. Dings and dents will show up and are impossible to remove without displacing the countertop. But if you want a pro-style countertop, those battle scars can be shown with pride.</p>
<h4>Cost of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Super-resilient material is water-, stain-, fade-proof and resists bacteria</li>
<li>No need for sealing; cleans with simple detergent and water</li>
<li>Integrates seamlessly with features like drainboards, sinks, and backsplashes</li>
<li>Manufactured to exact specifications, so potentially seamless</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not suitable for cutting; must use a board to protect from knives</li>
<li>Shows the smallest scratches and dents, which are very hard to remove</li>
<li>Noisy when kitchen tools come in contact</li>
<li>Fabrication will drive up the price unless you buy a ready-made sink and drainboard unit</li>
</ul>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Monique</span></i></p>
<h3>Moving from co-op to a house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After living in Brooklyn for nine years, I decided to move back to Queens in search of more space and a slice of the outdoors. I purchased a 1,300-square-foot attached brick rowhouse from the ‘40s. It had a small front patio where I could sit and drink my coffee on the weekends, plus a small front garden to plant vegetables and do some xeriscaping (landscaping that requires little or no irrigation).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="happy-homeowner-dining-area" class="alignnone wp-image-50383 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2.jpg" alt="happy homeowner in the dining area with white round table after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50364 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Image of the exterior of a brick Queens rowhouse" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the purpose of the purchase and subsequent renovation was to create a sanctuary where I could relax after a long day of work. I wanted to make sure to bring in the things that I had loved about my Brooklyn brownstone co-op, while enjoying and making good use of my new space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always wanted to live in a Craftsman cottage but knew I couldn’t find this style of building in New York City. Instead, I decided I would incorporate cottage-style elements into my interior design choices. A few things would need to be changed immediately; there were lime green walls in the bedroom and a vibrant orange hallway. I also wanted to rip up the linoleum and carpet floors, replace the house’s original windows, and update the kitchen, bathroom, and entryway.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3>Spicing up the entry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entryway </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was very important to me. Moving from an apartment to a house, I could now fully set the tone that welcomed everyone into my home. The entryway had been functional, but bland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="patterned-tiles-entryway" class="alignnone wp-image-50365 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg" alt="patterned tiles at entryway with two wooden doors after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-wallpaper-entryway-blue-door" class="alignnone wp-image-50406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg" alt="white wallpaper in entryway with blue door and blue patterend floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I added some touches that brought the outside in and made me smile whenever I opened the front door. I chose to custom design the steel front door in a Craftsman style that felt warm and inviting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the flooring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, white-and-blue handmade cement tiles added a lot of personality. I didn’t want the walls to pale in comparison to the bold floor, so I found a textured and paintable wallpaper that mimicked an abstracted cloud design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-room-separator-brown-floor-tile" class="alignnone wp-image-50368 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1.jpg" alt="white room separator with passageway to room on one side and the living room on another with brown floor tile after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="wooden-flooring-white-living-room" class="alignnone wp-image-50367 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1.jpg" alt="wooden flooring in white living room with blue couch after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t have enough space for a grand entrance, I still wanted to make a statement for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">front entry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using a modern fixture and opening up the arch to double the size in the living room.</span></p>
<h3>Design elements to make it truly home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized how important incorporating the outdoors into the space was for me. When I was a kid, we couldn’t really afford to renovate the wood-paneled walls that were in my bedroom. Instead, my mom gave my room a woodland theme and installed green carpet that was the color of grass and would encourage me to take off my socks so we could play barefoot in the “grass” together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-room-black-couch-wooden-floor" class="alignnone wp-image-50369 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg" alt="white room with black couch and white pendant light and wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-blue-couch" class="alignnone wp-image-50372 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg" alt="white living room with blue and red couch and white floor rug on wooden floor and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so excited when my Sweeten general contractor suggested I install European tilt-and-turn-style windows. You can open them all the way and really feel like you are inviting in the outdoors. We were able to remove the linoleum and carpet throughout the house and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stain the wood floors</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underneath. I debated going with a modern, gray stain, but ultimately decided on a timeless walnut that felt more appropriate to the cottage style. I loved the original </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built-in shelves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the living room, so I just asked for the design elements at the top to be cut off, which made the built-ins feel timeless versus dated.</span></p>

<h3>Form and function for a Cottage-style kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I decided to mix cooler colors and neutrals like blues, whites, and grays, balanced with a bit of warmth from some champagne bronze accents. I wanted a certain set of cabinet pulls that were too expensive for my budget, but was thrilled to find a similar version for a third of the price.</span></p>
<h3>Small kitchen details made the difference</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was these kinds of details that really started to matter to me throughout the process. I spent hours looking at doorknobs and faucets, which I hadn’t expected. I didn’t realize how much I would want a say in every design choice and how much I would care about all the little details that were going into my home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-closed-cabinets" class="alignnone wp-image-50379 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1.jpg" alt="white open kitchen with closed kitchen cabinets and golden handles and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-granite-counter" class="alignnone wp-image-50413 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-22.gif" alt="white kitchen cabinets and granite countertop and white backsplash in a wooden floored kitchen towards passageway after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="breakfast-nook-round-table" class="alignnone wp-image-50378 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2.jpg" alt="breakfast nook with round white table and chairs and a bench on wooden floor and white pendant light on top and large window with white sheer curtain after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-15-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I have room to eat in the kitchen. My contractor transformed a small broom closet in the hallway into a pull-out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pantry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It stores all of my dry goods and is so space-efficient. Without it, that closet would have held trash bags and a Swiffer, but now I use every inch of that space for my spices, peanut butter, and pancake mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One small accent that was a big deal for me was the ceramic crackle push plates for the swinging doors between the kitchen and the bedroom. I’m a big fan of British television and had been inspired by the homes in shows I watch. It was hard to find this kind of push plate in the U.S., so I ended up having them imported from England. I was so nervous about them making it over in one piece, but they did, and I’m so glad I was able to incorporate them into my space. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of my decisions were functional, but everyone thought I was crazy when I installed wainscoting in my very tight </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">powder room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I understand why—the wainscoting literally took away space—but I went for it anyway. As a trade-off, I saved space with a corner toilet and a size-appropriate sink. I am really happy with how it turned out.</span></p>
<h3>Remodeling with peace-of-mind</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t really need to take up Sweeten’s check-ins during the renovation. It was reassuring, though, to know they were there should issues come up, as this was my first major home renovation. It gave me peace of mind—like that optional purchase protection on a big product purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, I wasn’t sure how long everything would take or how involved I would be in the process. I was glad that I was able to be involved in most of the decisions, even though I <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work full-time and couldn’t be physically</a> present all day. I don’t know how working people managed projects like this before email!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My renovated space feels like a peaceful retreat. I love how welcoming and warm it feels for my friends and their kids to come and hang out. My contractor understood my vision and now I’m able to relax and fully be myself in this new space.</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner, Samantha</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We bought what was essentially a flip and closed on it the month before our oldest daughter, </span><span class="s1">now almost seven, arrived. We finished the buildout that became her bedroom the night before her birth. The apartment’s finishes weren&#8217;t our favorite, but we had our own place, and were a family. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom (with a creative-industry résumé); Jameson is a partner and the digital director at Athletics, a Brooklyn-based creative studio.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47279 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Outgrowing a home they love</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After having our second daughter nearly four years ago, we knew the apartment needed to change. </span><span class="s5">We </span><span class="s1">loved its location in the Clinton Hill Co-Ops and our hope was to extend our time in this place and the neighborhood. Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time</span><span class="s5"> to make this home more liveable for our family.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a design-build firm</a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tight—we were looking to renovate during our kids’ summer break and move back in before school resumed—and when we weren’t excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some who’d worked in our co-ops. That sold us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’m a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while I’m in the kitchen cooking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories I’d collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/unique-features-for-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome</a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t be afraid to ask for what I wanted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Previously, our daughters’ shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they weren’t soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed a sound-blocking pocket door</a> for the girls’ room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying we’ll wake them. </span></p>

<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. I’ve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be afraid to ask for what I wanted</a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.</span></p>
<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other rooms—we updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.</span></p>
<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art we’ve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love. </span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Michele</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Getting excited to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I lead a digital product design team for a large San Francisco-based company. I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn’t had an upgrade since the building’s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn’t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building’s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I’d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Finding inspiration from other renovators</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people’s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. </span><span class="s5">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.</span> <span class="s1">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5415#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose my Sweeten contractor</a> because his ideas matched mine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractors were great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen’s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bids for a full kitchen remodel</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg" alt="open shelving kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47055 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen cabinetry" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47059 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Transforming the bathroom wasn’t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn’t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material—a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I’m tall.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A timely business trip</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The project’s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I stayed for almost three weeks</a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I’m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.</span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<h3 class="p5">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation’s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to—close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I’ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it’s so nice not to feel like I’m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I’m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs—even my career—in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Update a kitchen with low-grade materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jen rented in neighborhoods across Brooklyn for 10 years before she bought her first apartment in a 1937 Crown Heights co-op building. She fell in love with how open the space was—with the exception of the tight, closed-in kitchen. The kitchen was recently renovated, but with cheaper, run-of-the-mill materials that didn’t quite match Jen’s style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a huge fan of the simple, Scandinavian vibe,&#8221; she said. (Think: neutral calming colors, simple design, and warm touches for that <a href="https://www.hyggelife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hygge life</a>). Jen purchased the 950-square-foot apartment with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intention to renovate</a> but decided to wait to get a better sense of how’d she use it.</p>

<h3>Opening up the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I had a pretty clear vision of the aesthetics and giving myself that extra year solidified those design decisions. My sofa faces the kitchen, so I&#8217;d spend more hours than I&#8217;d like to admit looking at it and imagining what I&#8217;d do,” Jen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35187" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the kitchen had an opening to the living room, it still felt closed off to the rest of the apartment because its working surfaces were behind a wall. &#8220;A weird empty space in the left part of the kitchen was supposed to be an eat-in area, but I was never going to use it for that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35184" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="http://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3>Adding a peninsula</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractors removed a wall came down and replaced it with a peninsula to connect the kitchen and living room. Instead of building out full upper cabinets, Jen opted for open shelving for an airy feel. She also took advantage of the extra space on the left side of the kitchen to add more base cabinetry. “Though I heard my share of conflicting opinions about open shelving, I’m so glad I stuck to my guns,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, white kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35181" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old flooring was replaced with wood</a> to match the living area. An integrated dishwasher and counter-depth fridge were installed for that European vibe. Jen did wind up compromising on a built-in gas cooktop and wall oven due to electrical restrictions. However, she ultimately attained the Scandinavian-minimal look she was aiming for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35188" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Finding tips and tricks for a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With her Crown Heights kitchen renovation behind her, Jen offers a few words of wisdom. For one, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start putting together a materials list</a> before you even hire a contractor. Jen assembled a spreadsheet with everything from appliances to light fixtures to track items she loved, and see if they went on sale. (Tip: Jen browsed Sweeten reno posts and their detailed source lists to find items!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She loved the transformation so much, choosing a favorite element was nearly impossible. “Is it cheating if I say the entire kitchen [is my favorite?] I’m still stunned by how transformed the space is with the wall gone.” She added, &#8220;Frankly, I never want to leave my apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jen recommends adding drawers to base cabinets for easier access to dishes. “I&#8217;m a shorty, so having all my dishes in drawers, instead of having to reach for them on my tippy toes, has been awesome,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h3>Deciding to renovate during COVID</h3>
<p>What do you do when a global pandemic hits in the middle of your home remodel—just as you’ve moved out of your house, with two babies under two years old in tow, to make way for the construction crew? Jaime Ray Newman washed her hands and pushed on.</p>
<div></div>

<p>“We were juggling a lot,” said the actor and producer, who had posted her project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in 2019 for the dream redo of her 1936 ranch home. “We were expecting our second baby. It was now or never to blow open and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redo the house</a>.” The Sweeten post stated a desire to “convert our old 1930s two-car <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage to ADU</a>,” also known as an accessory dwelling unit, (also known as a working studio, guest apartment, or multitasking hybrid.)</p>
<p>Jaime also hoped to do a space-reclaiming opening of her family’s living space. She shares it with her life and business partner Guy Nattiv, a filmmaker (they co-founded New Native Pictures and won an Academy for &#8220;SKIN&#8221;), their daughters Alma and soon-to-be Mila, and their dog, Kiwi. The project had been on her To-Do list forever.</p>

<p>“We’d been wanting to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert our garage since day one</a>,” Jaime said, “but had struggled with the permitting situation.” The area where they live in L.A. required single-family homes to have two-space covered parking. When the law changed, Jaime recalled, “We said, Let’s do this.” They decided to renovate the house at the same time. “We realized that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan, and a real closet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bath</a> for ourselves,” she said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46473 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg" alt="Jaime Newman" width="1000" height="1374" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-218x300.jpg 218w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-600x824.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The home &amp; garage renovation team takes shape</h3>
<p>Jaime, whose work includes winning an Oscar as a producer, playing a recurring character Elizabeth Manwill in Hulu’s <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> miniseries, as well as an essential district attorney role in Fox&#8217;s <em>Deputy</em>, had already gathered a reno dream team. “I bribed our dear friend Marcos Ferraez, a total visionary when it comes to imagining and reconfiguring a space, to come over and walk through the house,” she said. “We thought we needed to blow out the back of the house and add square footage, but we didn’t have the budget. I was stumped. Marcos completely reimagined our home within our current square footage.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going. But we were in desperate need of an office&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage space</a> was next. Jaime hired <a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer Haley Weidenbaum</a> to conceive of the layout and was stunned by Haley’s ability to maximize every square inch of the available 350 square feet. Haley also had a vision for the main living space, designing the primary bedroom and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. “Her talent and advice were invaluable,” Jaime said. From there she got on Sweeten and found her general contractor.</p>

<h3>Keeping family together during COVID</h3>
<p>Jaime was pretty clear on what she wanted. “I met with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple contractors</a>. What I liked most about the one we hired was that he had style. His taste was always on point,” she said. “He was also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very reasonable, and confident</a>.”</p>
<p>Like most of the world, the family had no idea of the uncertainty that lay ahead. For Jaime, in particular, early 2020 packed a punch. The COVID-19 threat loomed over the U.S. and then, she said, “my dad passed away in February.” Jaime wanted to support her mother and stay close by. It added up to difficult timing. “Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going,” she said. “But we were in desperate need of an office, and a separate space away from the kids so we could get work done,” Jaime said.</p>
<h3>Two designers for a Los Angeles garage remodel</h3>
<p>The project seemed to thrive on flux and change. “I realized at one point that much of our furniture no longer worked with the space, so we sold a lot of stuff on Facebook Marketplace to make room for new things,” she said. When Haley, who had started EVERHEM, a window-treatment company, got too busy and had to step away from the project, they brought in another designer.</p>

<p>“I have always had an Instagram crush on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madelynnfurlong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design consultant Madelynn Furlong</a>,” Jaime said. “I asked if she’d be game to take us to the finish line and re-think the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design of the house</a>. Her aesthetic is unique and she finds the most interesting pieces.” Through Madelynn, Jaime discovered amazing companies like Muuto, Industry West, Lulu and Georgia, Constance Guisset, and Hudson Valley Lighting, among others. And the designer knew how to find one-of-a-kinds.</p>
<p>“Madelynn sent me a link to a giant, vintage burl wood dining table on Chairish for a terrific price, and said “BUY THIS NOW,” Jaime remembers. “It weighs 600 pounds. When it arrived, the household was blown away. This work of art will be passed down to my kids!”</p>

<p>Collaborating with two designers with very different feels was the most fun and satisfying part of the process, according to Jaime. Through them (and Pinterest), she found the original pieces and touches she wanted to make the space her own. Especially bath and kitchen design ideas. “I wanted something fun for our kitchen backsplash and I’m obsessed with Fireclay Tile, so that was easy! The bathroom floor needed to be non-slip, so we picked a slate from Clé Tile that we loved. I also fell head over heels for a hexagon tile from Popham Design.</p>

<h3>What does renovating feel like?</h3>
<p>Asked about a renovator’s most important virtue, Jaime chose patience. The process is long, she said, but your memory is short once you are settled in. “It’s kind of like after having your first baby!” the actor jokes. Confidence is also key, she said. These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts. And <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a> whose aesthetic you love.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad we lived in the house for years before renovating it, so we understood our needs and how best to accommodate them within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a>,” Jaime said. Especially now, during COVID, she says, “We are in pure bliss here. The house is unique, but warm and inviting, a family compound and a comfortable respite. I cannot wait until we can have guests over!”</p>

<p>It’s hard to say anything but yes to the job next door. “This project, right around the corner from our home and office, was the most convenient project we’ve done,” said Keren Richter, principal designer and founder, with husband and partner Thomas Richter, of <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>. But that wasn’t the only <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspect of the condo</a>, part of a historic 19th-century building conversion in South Williamsburg, that drew them to the remodel. The lofted duplex, with its 19-foot ceilings and armspan-width, was unique in its shipping-tube configuration. And then there was the owner. Jared had stayed all over and sought to bring an alluring boutique-hotel vibe to the place.</p>
<p>“I’d been bouncing around between cities for a while—Amsterdam, San Francisco, back to New York City,” Jared said. “I wanted a place to call home, that would really be a sanctuary. I spoke with the design team about the aesthetics of spaces I loved, like SoHo Farmhouse, the Bowery Hotel, the Maritime in Chelsea, Brooklyn’s Wythe Hotel, the Freehold, the Clover Club, and the Walter.” The White Arrow duo was reeled in.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“We agreed we wanted to give the home the trappings of a sophisticated urban hotel,” Keren said. “It needed to be great for entertaining, hosting guests, relaxing and working,” which Jared, a digital agency founder, had been doing from home for years. The apartment, despite its high ceilings, was extremely narrow, with a ground-floor kitchen and living room that pushed the boundaries of its small footprint.</p>
<p>“Our goal was to make the home feel spacious and accentuate the positive,” Keren said. The walls, she explained, were a “disjointed arrangement of extrusions and unflattering angles,” including an inset stretch of exposed antique brick and a boxed-in, underutilized loft-bedroom platform. “We streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display,” she added.</p>
<p>“Every square foot had to be well utilized,” Jared said. He wanted to add nooks and niches to put his things, and make the place truly feel like his own.</p>
<blockquote><p>We streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display</p></blockquote>
<p>The designers and their client also agreed that, instead of demolishing the place, they would elevate the existing finishes and fixtures. “We set out to minimize the rustic details the developer had selected during the conversion, and bring the home to a quiet level of cohesiveness with a new color palette,” Keren said.</p>
<p>Following White Arrow’s plan, their Sweeten general contractor streamlined the place’s odd juts and angles, and adding custom integrated display shelving in the kitchen as well as the home office-niche. Workers refinished the white-oak flooring with a more neutral, beige color tone and painted the dark exposed brick. “I knew I wanted lighter floors for a more Scandinavian aesthetic, but was wary of bleaching them,” Jared recalls. He trusted the team and has no regrets. Similarly, whitewashing the brick felt risky when the designers suggested it—but it “totally opened the room,” Jared said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45654" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg" alt="painted green cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>“Our client took some creative leaps,” Keren recalled. Repainting the gray kitchen cabinetry in a vivid green was a biggie. “The color is a total showstopper, and we are so glad he was game!” Keren remarked. Their Sweeten contractor retiled the kitchen backsplash with marble penny tile and changed all door hardware and plumbing fittings in the kitchen, as well as the two bathrooms, which got new grout and caulk, toilets, vanities, medicine cabinets, and fixtures.</p>
<p>Throughout the place, the contractors added new lighting locations and dimmer switches and swapped in new fixtures. “We added dramatic chandeliers and sconces that draw the eye up to take in the dramatic, high ceilings,” Keren said. “Living finishes” such as an unlacquered brass kitchen faucet, bring warmth and texture. A home-media specialist integrated a sound system and a wall-mounted TV.</p>
<p>It was with the furnishings that the designers really connected with the hotel aesthetic they strove for. “We chose distinctive, contemporary pieces in rich materials and jewel tones,” Keren said. Both Keren and Thomas were excited to shop and showcase an unusual mix of international designers, including Muller Van Severin, Gio Ponti, Atelier Areti, Harto, Maison Sarah Lavoine, Slash Objects, and Trnk. “We sought out furnishings that would do ‘double duty’ to maximize small spaces,” Keren said—sophisticated sofa beds, the secretary desk that Jared describes as “an ingenious space-saver.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Every piece,” Keren said, “is of the right proportion and scale,” including the king-size bed that Jared considered a must-have in the loft bedroom. The designers searched endlessly to find the furniture pieces that would allow every room to feel both luxurious and functional. To mellow the mood of the bedroom, Keren said, they added “a floor-to-ceiling, emerald-green velvet drapery to hide the formerly visible ensuite bath.”</p>
<p>The project had a fast turnaround, thanks to Sweeten’s vetting and follow-up during the project, Keren said. “The contractor was easy to work with and accommodating as the scope grew.”</p>
<p>As for the owner—Jared has been pleased to have his own digs to hunker down in during uncertain times. “The designs are super smart and well executed,” he says. “The living-room nook is discrete and conducive to relaxation. I am really happy.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Keren and Thomas of White Arrow, and Jared, for sharing the results of an inspired collaboration!</em></p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45098 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45113 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="Yonkers family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg" alt="drip dishware collection" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg" alt="kitchen display ideas" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45105" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen with natural wood cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg" alt="Bertazzoni stove" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45106" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen storage ideas" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45100" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Balancing the kitchen structures</h3>
<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>

<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Smart upgrades for the kitchen and bathroom solve pesky problems</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ryan, an editor, and Sophie, a paralegal, envisioned their renovation, they knew they needed to address the problems they inherited from the “quick and dirty reno” completed in 2009, the year Ryan bought the apartment. The advantage of waiting years to renovate? “It was abundantly clear how we utilized the kitchen,” says Ryan, adding “I had 10 years to save up because even a modest renovation like this one isn’t cheap in NYC!” In their 750-square foot, prewar one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, the partners agreed that the odd-shaped kitchen needed rearranging to take advantage of every square inch; and the bathroom required rescuing from a “South Florida Grandma aesthetic.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> To tackle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project, they posted</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview"><span class="s2"><i>chose their contractor</i></span></a><i>. </i></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44140 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg" alt="kitchen-white-cabinets-bar seating-remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Ryan</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whoever designed the last renovation really did not think things through. In the kitchen, which is an odd trapezoidal space, the priority was maximizing both storage and counter space, and minimizing clutter. For instance, there was a 24-inch soffit between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling that was just empty space. So we knew we’d need cabinets extending to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44150 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg" alt="renovators portrait-new york city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sink was on a diagonal resulting in a large dead space. And the refrigerator was a huge obstruction at the back of the room and the first thing you see when you enter the foyer. Its positioning made the kitchen seem smaller and it just needed to find a new spot. We weren’t sure if that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom was small and dark with very little natural light. The vanity was made of builder-grade particle board that had swollen with moisture, and the medicine cabinet protruded. We were intent on transforming the look and feel of the bathroom—even the toilet was pink! The living room got a refresh with repainted walls, a replastered ceiling, and new sconce lighting.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kitchen, I commissioned a one-hour consult with an interior designer, Clare of <a href="https://www.121studio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One to One Studio</a>, while still planning everything out. The designer suggested moving the refrigerator to the corner and relocating the doorway to accommodate the fit. That might seem obvious in retrospect, but to me, it was a revelation. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets so everything</a> would look integrated. The odd-shaped kitchen space came with difficult angles, pipes, and protrusions. We went to Ikea to experiment with a layout, but couldn’t get their premade boxes to fit in a satisfactory way. I also tried </span><span class="s3">Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, which had more options in terms of box sizes, but I worried the boxes wouldn’t be delivered in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier. He was able to build boxes that accommodated the kitchen’s unusual dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen floor tile came from the designer, during our consult. I asked her specifically what I should get since I was stumped by all the options. She recommended black slate tile: durable, attractive, and cheap. Her basic ethos was “make it look expensive without being expensive.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The backsplash, on the other hand, was a splurge. We always </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> scallop tiles. Initially, we envisioned a teal color but we realized it was just too loud. So we went with a scalloped tile in muted but varied gray tones. The countertop was another more expensive finish: Empira White featured veining we really liked that complemented the backsplash.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> slab cabinets without any pulls, and I agreed. By then, I was really <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffering from decision fatigue</a> and didn’t have the wherewithal to evaluate the merits of different cabinet hardware!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie chose the kitchen to be clean and streamlined, whereas I wanted the bathroom to have quirkier touches. I put together a sort of mood board where we considered a bunch of looks like intricate marble mosaics, but marble stains and needs a lot of upkeep. Plus, our contractor recommended we get large-format tile, due to some peculiarities of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ultimately chose 36”x36” glazed porcelain tile that looks like marble at about $4/square foot, which was pretty reasonable, especially since we tiled up to the ceiling. It also worked well on the floor given the bathroom’s size constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vanity was more of a splurge, but I justified it because I hadn’t seen other vanities quite like it. And it fit. A 25-inch vanity would have been too small, and a 30-inch vanity would have been crammed in. The Goldilocks vanity needed to be between 25 to 30 inches, but powder room vanities sit comfortably within that range. I just had to pay twice what I’d initially budgeted. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-bathtub"  class="alignnone wp-image-44065 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white bathtub and white vanity with stand and large frameless mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renovation itself mostly went off without a hitch, from getting board approval to designing it to seeing the project through to completion. Our contractor helped a lot with the paperwork. Between the management company and the board, there were A LOT of forms that I needed to put together. Luckily, the contractor had worked in the building before, which is one of the reasons I hired him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when. Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership. Have a plan before you hire a contractor, know what you want and why you want it, so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, my downstairs neighbor was particularly helpful. She winters in Florida, and let us stay in her apartment, meaning we didn’t have to find a place to crash. I work from home most days, so I could stay in the building and check out the renovation throughout the day to make sure we were adhering to the plan. Also, I didn’t have to find a place to board my cat, Titus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the clean look, I love how our new kitchen is all integrated. From a functionality standpoint, I’m very pleased with its usability. It easily accommodates two people working at the same time, has tons of storage space and counter space, yet still seems open.</span></p>
<p><em><span class="s1">Thank you, Sophie and Ryan, for sharing your journey with us!</span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When avid entertainers embark on an apartment renovation, it’s sure to lead to greatness in the kitchen. That was the case in this 1940s Brooklyn co-op that Jessica, a brand strategist from London, and Jesse, a filmmaker and content producer from Queens, bought together soon after getting married. The couple planned to renovate the 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom home, with their primary focus on increasing the functionality of the cooking space and storage in other rooms.

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Jessica</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our story begins when we started looking for a home, and specifically a kitchen<i>,</i> we could love. We were living happily in Brooklyn in a one-bedroom rental, but after we got married, investing in an apartment for the long-term was our goal. We noticed that well-renovated places coming on the market were triggering bidding wars and started thinking about buying an apartment to redo. Being big foodies, we got excited to build a beautiful kitchen to cook in.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We came across a cluster of buildings called the Clinton Hill Co-ops and were attracted by the generous square footage of the apartments, which were built in the mid-20th century. When a two-bedroom needing updates became available, we snapped it up. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a>, along with our team from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blumenthal Architecture and Interiors</a>. We planned to open up the kitchen to the living room and add a peninsula where we could prepare food or just hang out. Plumbing would be relocated for a better cooking layout. However, a partition surrounding the existing refrigerator closed off the kitchen, disrupting flow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution: Demo the partition and move the fridge, thereby creating space for a six-foot peninsula. It was designed with full-length drawers for pans and dinnerware, built-in shelves at the end of the peninsula for cookbooks, and toe-level kick-drawers, which let us utilize every inch. It also has a wine fridge! We went for under-cabinet lighting and pull-out components: a pantry, spice rack, and garbage bin. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/colourfulstef/"><span class="s5">Stef Steen,</span></a> a color specialist based in the UK, helped us make minimalist palettes with touches of strong color for soul. Our cabinets are custom, the uppers in white and lowers in dark royal blue. People say not to mix shaker and flat-front cabinets, but we liked the flat style for the drawers, where protruding pulls can be annoying. We’re not disappointed. We settled on brushed brass cabinet hardware—after ordering three different styles. One of our favorite aspects of the kitchen is a graphic tile with dark grouting for the backsplash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stef made a booklet with Pantone numbers for matching paint, tile, and accessories. We pulled our kitchen colors to other rooms, adding accents in green and yellow.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though we hadn&#8217;t lived in the apartment yet, we thought hard about how we’d use every space. Their contractor took some square footage from the kitchen to widen the hallway making room for a long built-in bookshelf. </span><span class="s1">For storage in both bedrooms, separate closets were merged together as a single built-in with full-height doors and shelving.</span></p>
<p>To reach optimal electrical aspirations, layouts and furniture placement were carefully planned for overhead lighting installations in the bedrooms and living rooms. Phone chargers were also built into kitchen drawers and outlets were tucked away for electric toothbrushes and hairdryers in the bathroom.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We rolled with the geometrics, doing graphic tile in the bathroom, too, and pairing it with less expensive, easier-to-clean porcelain. (It’s no joke when your general contractor says everything must be in stock when purchased. After we were promised timely shipping on the bathroom wall tiles by a retailer, the day came and they weren’t there; I spent a stressful morning trying to find something similar.) The tile contrasts nicely with the simple brass fixtures and wood vanity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the expertise of our construction and design teams, our goals came together in a vibrant space. Our contractor met with us weekly—or more—to check on progress and we felt supported knowing we could turn to Sweeten if something went wrong. Jesse and I asked our contractor to copy us both on communications, which worked for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeing our space transform and our vision come to life was so thrilling. We love our kitchen and take such pleasure in cooking and entertaining in it. </span></p>

<h3>A style fix</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel’s Long Island City, Queens, loft boasts 15-foot ceilings and loads of natural light. The apartment’s kitchen, however, didn’t suit the couple’s Scandinavian, minimalist style. It lacked counter space, the sink was smaller than standard, and the to-be renovators just weren’t vibing with the finishes. They wanted integrated appliances with all clean lines and everything stowed away in cabinets or drawers. The rest of their home has walnut and matte finishes throughout, so they knew they wanted a similar aesthetic in the cooking space, too. The couple, a creative director and software engineer, who also has a three-year-old son, </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/36746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>New cabinetry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with a clear perspective, the couple got to work with their contractor to reimagine their kitchen. Gabriel used the Ikea kitchen planner tool to lay out the space, exploring its customization offerings to suit their needs. The cabinetry is all Ikea but modified to cover the appliances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wall cabinet containing the range hood is shorter and wider than the surrounding units but is still covered by the same door size. The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size to not only fit into the existing space, but also align with Ikea panels. “The fridge hunt was probably the single largest use of our time. Ask my wife about chasing our son through AJ Madison,” Gabriel said. Their contractor ended up cutting a 36 inch Ikea panel into three pieces to integrate the refrigerator with the walnut cabinets. They also fit in a cabinet right next to it. All of the drawers and wall cabinets are equipped with LED lighting, adding to the custom feel.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Patience from their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sleek aesthetic carried throughout their material choices, from the matte black faucet, lack of cabinet hardware, and a single slab counter and backsplash without any seams. “Our contractor was very patient with all my crazy ideas and helped me make them actually work,” Roxana said. “He helped brainstorm a lot of the Ikea ‘hacking’ and was very patient with us,” she continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for their new kitchen? “It feels modern, calm, and welcoming. It fits our needs and it feels like home,” the couple shared. </span></p>

In this blog post, we visit the couple in the second phase of the project. To recap: They’d purchased a historic brownstone with “good bones” on a quiet street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. They were aware that the circa 1910 building was in need of a total interior gutting and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted contractors.</p>
<p>What they didn’t expect to learn was that the wooden beam that had brought essential stability to their brownstone for 100-plus years suffered from rot. They’d hired both a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect</a> and a Sweeten general contractor to drive the overhaul. Once the couple had installed the integral metal beam running through their long-sought brownstone, they were initiated. Moving walls, installing a kitchen, and replacing splintered floorboards were achievable tasks. They were pros.</p>

They would have, once finished, three units to rent as well as their own top-floor studio pied-a-terre, which they planned to use as a second home. A key goal was to preserve the building’s prewar details while streamlining and modernizing the interior spaces. They also wanted to create bigger, brighter apartments and therefore planned to convert the building’s traditional two-bedroom configurations to one-bedroom layouts. The project also included opening up the kitchens and enlarging the bathrooms. All applied to the ground-floor garden apartment.</p>

<p>The initial plan for the fireplace was to remove it—although the mirrors were original and in good shape, it&#8217;s doors were damaged and the pillars didn&#8217;t suit their aesthetic. Their architect suggested they &#8220;<span class="s1">repaint it and open it up to the brick in the bottom area, &#8220;Jerry said. &#8220;We really like how it turned out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>They also preserved as much original wood flooring as possible which were stained and discolored, including the inlaid mahogany borders. &#8220;<span class="s1">We were surprised when both our Sweeten architect and contractor said that the living room floors were salvageable,&#8221; he said. The width of the boards was no longer made but &#8220;t</span><span class="s1">he contractor went out of his way to find a warehouse with a supply of vintage floorboards to fill in gaps and match to the existing flooring,&#8221; Jerry said. </span></p>

In this apartment, she and the architects decided to move things around, shifting the kitchen forward and the bath back. By reshuffling the spaces and putting the kitchen adjacent to the living room, they were able to create a kitchen island that floats on the edge of the living space. The quartz-topped island has counter seating, making it great for quick breakfasts and weekend gatherings; it incorporates an under-counter sink and is lit by a pair of modern pendant fixtures. The shiny stainless-steel hood and dishwasher are from IKEA, as is the gray cabinetry. “We really like the geometric tiles we chose for the kitchen backsplash,” Jerry said.  They add unique character and dimension to what is now a highly visible wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40747 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40757 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-14.gif" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Putting the kitchen here opened up what had formerly been a hallway, lined with inset wall cabinets. The doors of these units had been painted a bright chartreuse green—not the couple’s color, but there was a character to them that they wanted to preserve. The contractor stripped the paint, resurfaced, and repainted the doors to look almost new. <span class="s1">&#8220;We are very happy with the restoration of the cabinets,&#8221; Jerry said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great feature for the apartment—it adds so much storage space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Janet loves how the original doors, now bright white, add a historic touch and some concealed storage to the wall facing the kitchen. The contractor installed new shelving and additional drawers, too, to increase the cupboards’ sleek functionality.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/E1bZ07c4-A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40882 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Going for a more open layout really worked in other ways, too, with their old-new aesthetic. The revamped kitchen’s modern appliances are a great contrast to the fantastic old fireplace that is the living room’s most notable feature. They kept it, had the contractor replace the broken display door and window with a very close match, and repainted its mirrored mantel.</p>
<p>The kitchen’s relocation also did wonders for the bedroom, which is at the apartment’s rear. Having opened up the space, they expanded it further by eliminating the rear portion of the apartment’s narrow floor-through hallway and a tiny water closet next to the garden door. When all those walls came down, they had a large, sunny bedroom, flooded with light but completely private. There was room as well to build a large, sliding-door closet with built-in shelving.</p>

The fixtures and hardware, including the faucet and an open train-rack shelf, nod to the traditional. The couple stuck with the elongated shower tile they had chosen for the other rental units—like subway tiles, but stretched—and went with a large rain shower head to add modern luxury to the large stand-up shower. The hexagonal floor tiles are repeats from upstairs as well.</p>
<p>From the front door to back, the apartment came together beautifully, and Janet and Jerry have their Sweeten team to thank. Jerry recalls that the general contractor, who managed the timeline and the subcontractors from one phase into the next, did an excellent job communicating and keeping the project on schedule. “We found the company honest and responsible for the quality of all work,” he said. “At one point, when we felt like some of the workmanship was sub-par—some newly installed tiles in the bathroom were cracked—the contractor acknowledged our complaint and worked to fix the issue.”</p>

<p>Sweeten also matched them with an architect. Prior to tapping the service, they were about to hire an architect they found on a chat forum only to discover the architect had a less than stellar reputation.</p>
<p>Jerry said that the fact that this has so far been such a smooth project is almost unbelievable, given that on closing day he’d had no idea where to start looking for a good, honest contractor. “Without Sweeten, I would have randomly chosen a company I found on my own,” he confesses—and may or may not have had success.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had the peace of mind of having the service &#8220;be the middleman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;W</span><span class="s1">ith Sweeten, the contractors are more accountable. Suddenly, my experience and satisfaction matter much more which is great.&#8221;</span></p>

The apartment is gorgeous, livable, and comfortable. “Soon it will be rented out to a lucky tenant,” Jerry said, “and we’ll move to the top floor.” Check back to see how Janet and Jerry make the upstairs apartment their own.</p>

<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333333;"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Sally. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>“After” photos by Pixy Interiors.</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally, a writer, editor, and digital media executive, and Ross, a certified financial planner, bought their two-bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens in a 1946 Art Deco building. Sally had already been through three renovations in other homes. She typically looked for <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spaces in fixer-upper condition</a> (and at an “unrenovated” price) versus buying a recently remodeled home that was not her style. ”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that I can invest in my renovation, get the look and functionality that I want, build equity in my home—and be satisfied with the aesthetic because it’s my design,” she shared.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="ikea cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-40344 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>An inconvenient kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1,100-square-foot home was definitely in need of a renovation. Luckily, it had good bones: hardwood floors, thick plaster walls, and high-coved ceilings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to wait to renovate and see if they should keep the existing galley footprint. It became clear that as a two-cook household, Sally and Ross needed more open space, as they could never fit in the kitchen simultaneously. When the dishwasher was open, it blocked the fridge. Plus, the storage situation wasn’t working. Case in point? To find small appliances in the lower cabinets, Sally had to get on her hands and knees with a flashlight, pulling everything out and back in again.</span></p>
<h3>High marks for contractor communication</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years of <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envisioning the kitchen transformation</a>, Sally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten, received <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matches to Queens contracting firms</a>, and interviewed candidates. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor she chose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “stood out as the best communicator” and really understood the aesthetic she was looking to achieve. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was able to explain differences in his proposal and showed where his bid foresaw issues the others hadn’t. These were things that were going to come up, and we were going to have to pay for; he was just calling them out ahead of time. I appreciated that,” Sally shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-40350 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen plans took shape</a>, she had two design plans: one with the kitchen totally open to the living area, and, Plan B, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/decisions-galley-kitchen-renovation-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley style with a partial wall</a>. During a walkthrough with her contractor and building manager, they discovered water supply, disposal, and gas lines that couldn’t be moved without disrupting service to the building. That meant Plan B, which (spoiler alert!) Sally ended up loving. </span></p>
<h3>The vision without the price tag</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally wanted all-paneled and integrated appliances that felt more like furniture. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found myself gravitating toward kitchens that banked all the tall pantries with the fridges to one side, like Poggenpohl. Henrybuilt has a sleekness I coveted, with its signature absence of wall cabinets and a ubiquitous shelf running along the tops of the slab stone backsplashes. I fell in love with the shaker cabinetry of Plain English, their wonderfully functional sink islands, and use of slab marble,” she said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40343" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44860 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I’d had any challenges with my contractor, which I didn’t, I knew [Sweeten was] there to advise and help me out.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marble backsplash, which Sally referred to as “the star of the show,” consists of two consecutive slabs. A fabricator book-matched them to create the dramatic arc just above the center of the cooktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen design on budget</a>, they designed the kitchen using the IKEA planner tool and sent a PDF of the design to a cabinet manufacturer who outfitted the IKEA cabinet boxes with all custom doors. Opting for stock bases saved the couple $25,000.</span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="brass and marble kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45246 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall flow improved greatly, thanks to the separate wall ovens and cooktop. Plus, with the refrigerator outside of the main cooking area, it’s easy for guests to grab drinks. The refrigerator is also flanked by tall pantries and cabinets that hold cleaning supplies. Similarly, a narrow unit stores brooms and mops, and all of the base cabinets have deep drawers with organizers. There’s also a unit of freezer drawers, ideal for Sally who batch cooks on the weekends.</span></p>
<h3>Researching contractors with Sweeten</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally had a strong perspective and sense of what she wanted for her kitchen renovation, and she found a contractor who brought her vision to life. “The number one thing I did right was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire the right contractor</a>,” she said. Before she chose her contractor, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> shared advice with her on how to compare contractors, which she used to great effect. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the job, they reached out several times to see how it was going. If I’d had any challenges with my contractor, which I didn’t, I knew they were there to advise and help me out.”</span></p>

<h3>Tips from a veteran renovator</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, a four-time renovator, Sally has a lot of advice to share with fellow renovators. “Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ou’re going to be making so many choices it will make your head spin. Resist the urge to choose the trendiest or fanciest option at every single decision point. You want one thing, like a marble backsplash, to stand out as the focal point, then maybe a few smaller things, like brass cabinet hardware that picks up the brass in the faucets or in the light fixtures. Let the rest of your choices be the plain backdrop that lets these few gems shine,” she said.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40349" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="broom closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-in-all, the renovation finished without a hitch. Sally and Ross love their kitchen. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is extremely gratifying to have a design in your head and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it become a reality</a>. This kitchen is everything that I dreamed it could be. Ross and I cook meals together, clean up together, and everything we need is at our fingertips. And at the reveal party for our floor neighbors, the open kitchen made entertaining so easy and enjoyable.”</span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Sally and Ross, for sharing your renovation with us!</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: After moving from an apartment in Kensington, Brooklyn, to a brownstone in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, Christina and Aaron were ready to renovate their “new” kitchen. Located in a 2,600-square-foot brownstone originally built in 1901, the cook space was definitely showing its age. The multi-color cabinets and floors were falling apart and the appliances were also outdated. Aaron, a director of child programming, and Christina, a registered nurse, wanted a clean and contemporary kitchen better suited for their family of three (including their son Maverick). The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/31654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple chose ceiling-high custom cabinets, with the bottom units painted in a rich navy and the uppers in white. Aside from the refrigerator and cabinets above, they left one wall open to include a small table and two chairs next to a big window. Just outside the kitchen and right off their separate dining room, they converted part of the hallway into an extra pantry area. The floating shelves match the ones used in the far end of the kitchen built from reclaimed wood from <a href="https://www.bigreuse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Reuse</a>.</span></p>

From the beginning, he provided a detailed plan outlining the timeline, a list of needed materials, and recommended businesses and suppliers. Sweeten Client Services also checked in on the project status and contractor performance to ensure the couple was happy with the progress.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest challenges we faced with this project were the unexpected discoveries that would often add on to the workload and adjust the timeline of the project, such as the discovery that the floor needed to be re-leveled before tiling,” Aaron said. The electrical also needed to be updated to power the new appliances and the ceiling height had to be adjusted due to pre-existing damage. If you’re renovating an older home, Aaron strongly advises leaving plenty of room wiggle room in your budget because during demolition, issues that weren’t noticeable before can come to the surface.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Cooking has become so much easier and enjoyable thanks to their new counter space and the bigger stove.</span></p>

Their white-glove apartment was submerged under several inches of water—the result of a leak in an apartment several floors above.</p>

However, the problem worsened<span style="color: #333333;"> during the initial remediation period. </span>Dehumidifiers were brought in to dry out the water damage, but the walls, ceilings, and floors harbored such high levels of moisture that black mold developed in the summer heat. After three long rounds of mold remediation, the apartment was finally cleared for renovation at the end of 2016.</p>

Jean visited and saw the damage, plus what remained of an impressive art collection—amassed over a lifetime of travels, including Picassos and ancient sculptures. The scope of work was to include not only the kitchen, where the leak began, but<span style="color: #333333;"> also other parts of the apartment, including the adjacent hallway pantry, laundry room, guest room and bath, and the formal dining room. Eventually, the homeowners decided to convert their now-grown son’s bedroom into a study, and their daughter&#8217;s former room into a lounge/exercise space.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>They sent us three contractors to interview, which was a huge relief. I’m doing this for the first time, and I was totally out of my comfort zone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their Sweeten contractor gutted all of the floors, walls, and ceilings and then began the work of restoration. The couple was interested in restoring what was previously there while bringing a freshness and openness to space by choosing new materials and finishes. The kitchen, which had sported a stainless steel backsplash, outdated cabinets, and inadequate lighting, was given a makeover that included custom gray cabinets paired with white quartz countertops and a unique amazonite backsplash.<span style="color: #333333;"> The homeowner explained, &#8220;We visited the stone yard with the contractor and marked the piece out. We wanted it bookended and to come together in an inverted V over the sink.&#8221; This was done over both the sink in the walk-through pantry as well as the main kitchen space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Julie-Marcuse-Apt-24.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38896 size-full" title="taupe-kitchen-cabinets-and-tile-flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Julie-Marcuse-Apt-24.gif" alt="taupe kitchen cabinets and tile flooring and white countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" /></a>New pendants were added to light up the breakfast table, where the duo generally eats all their meals unless they are entertaining a larger group. “If we want to have more people over, we use the dining room, but otherwise we eat in the kitchen,” the homeowner said. Both the oval-shaped table and radiator cover were designed by the homeowners which their contractors commissioned to have made. Useful storage solutions were added including a dedicated spice drawer and a movable cart outfitted with a cutting board that can be moved wherever needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the refrigerator was relocated from the hallway pantry area to the main kitchen space, which made it much easier to access, and a smaller, secondary refrigerator was added instead. “I’m a big condiments person, so we made sure to add room for them,” the homeowner said.</p>

It includes works on paper and canvas; bronze and wood sculpture, ceramics and ceremonial objects. The hope was that the renovation would open up sufficient space and light to showcase these many objects of beauty and turned out to be one of the most gratifying aspects of the renovation.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">In what had been their now-grown daughter&#8217;s bedroom, the homeowners envisioned a serene and comforting space for lounging as well as exercise. The walls were painted lavender, inspired by an acrylic and paper painting that had been done by a friend. This was a theme throughout their home: &#8220;We wanted to give the artwork room to breathe, and to be the inspiration for the color palette in each room.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39677 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39946 mb-0 size-full" title="window-near-accent-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13.jpg" alt="window corner and accent wall after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333333;">Concurrently, they also decided to replace all of their landmarked windows. This alone took 3-4 weeks, and the Sweeten contractor had to make sure to protect the built-ins and previous renovation work. He also topped</span> </span><span class="s1">all of the windowsills with Caesarstone.</span></p>
<p>The homeowners are so happy to be back in their apartment, after pushing through<span style="color: #333333;"> over </span>two years of negotiations, paperwork, and red tape—not to mention mold, dust, and debris in every corner of their home. ”You come to realize, what one person thinks is a good job is not what another person might consider a good job,” the homeowner said. “Sweeten was so supportive. They called periodically when we were getting very disheartened. They sent us three contractors to interview, which was a huge relief. I’m doing this for the first time, and I was totally out of my comfort zone. We had no idea how to pick people—so Sweeten was incredibly helpful.”</p>
<p>They report that even though they felt like giving up on many occasions, they persevered. What seems like courage is really having &#8220;no choice&#8221;. This was their home. We were happy to hear that the best part of the whole situation was their Sweeten contractor, who delivered what he promised and more.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Make a kitchen better suited for entertaining and cooking<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Rob, a musician, purchased an apartment on the top floor of a Harlem brownstone six years ago. Shoko, a writer, moved into the Harlem abode two years ago, and the couple has lived together ever since. Their 900-square-foot apartment dates back to the late 19th century, though the interiors were updated in the early 2000s. Overall, they were happy with how the home looked (except the kitchen). “The kitchen&#8217;s orange-y cabinetry, shiny black appliances, and brown countertop stuck out. Rob travels a lot for work, and every time we&#8217;d FaceTime, he&#8217;d see the cabinets in the background and say, ‘Okay, that&#8217;s it. Let&#8217;s really do it this time.’ Finally, we just decided to take the leap,” Shoko shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39660 size-full" title="oak-cabinets-and-black-appliances-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets with black appliances and hardwood floors before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>. Aside from the overall appearance changes, the couple also wanted to improve the flow and function—more storage was a must. “We decided to redo the kitchen mainly because as we get older, we find ourselves spending more and more time at home. We love to eat out, but we also love to cook and have friends over,” Shoko shared.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They worked with their general contractor and a web-based design company specializing in IKEA kitchens, <a href="https://inspiredkitchendesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspired Kitchen Design</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to bring their vision of a minimal, but warm space to their kitchen. The cabinet bases the couple chose were outfitted with custom cabinet doors from Semihandmade (a recommendation from designer </span><a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keren Richter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose work Shoko has written about and that&#8217;s been <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">featured on Sweeten Stories</a>). “I loved their aesthetic, and as soon as I saw their Supermatte clay slab, I was sold on that color-wise,” she said. The open shelving and brass drawer pulls are also from Semihandmade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the kitchen didn’t take advantage of the ceiling height. The renovators decided to extend the upper cabinetry as close to it as possible. The extra space has now left them wondering if they should get more appliances, like a stand mixer. “That&#8217;s something I never dreamed I&#8217;d say as a New Yorker in a (relatively) small space,” Shoko shared. Their other design decisions, from the lighting to the countertops, were all part of creating a cohesive, simple look. Together, their finishes and materials feel warm, inviting, and clean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple worked very closely with their general contractor to bring <span style="color: #333333;">IKD’s</span> design to fruition. “The contractor’s role was incredibly important from the outset—and it grew in importance as the project progressed,” Shoko said. He focused on understanding the full intention of the design, providing recommendations and workarounds (when needed) at every stage. “Not only did he and his team install the entire project, but they were a much-needed set of extra eyes with an experienced concern for aesthetics and functionality. We feel so lucky to have found them, and couldn&#8217;t recommend them highly enough,” she continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, getting started on the project proved to be the biggest challenge. The renovation process itself only revealed a few minor issues: the walls weren&#8217;t straight and required hidden adjustments to make the measurements work out; and some delivering delays. Regardless, they stayed on time—and budget.</span></p>

Their general contractor provided assurance (and answers) the whole way through.</p>
<p>“We are so happy with our kitchen. It&#8217;s exactly what we wanted. It makes our entire apartment feel brighter and bigger, and it&#8217;s a total pleasure to cook, eat, and host there. We feel even more at home than we did before,” Shoko said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Shoko’s favorite element of the new kitchen? It’s a tie between then open shelving and countertops. “ I love ceramics, so it&#8217;s fun to have a space to display our favorite things. We were also very excited about our new countertop. That bright white <span style="color: #333333;">Caesarstone</span> is a breath of fresh air,” she said.</p>

<h3>A closed-off Brooklyn kitchen with potential</h3>
<p>A beautiful neighborhood, an optimal layout, and a lot of natural light led Melissa to purchase her corner apartment in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill Co-ops. The literary agent planned to renovate the kitchen and remove walls to take advantage of the light from the living area. Melissa also wanted to reflect the building’s mid-century style in her own space. “I wanted mid-century-Scandi-style-kitchen-meets-’70s-Italian-modern with warmer accents in the textiles and color,” she shared. Nearly 14 years after she bought her apartment, Melissa posted her renovation project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. She was <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a contractor</a> who helped her bring her kitchen dreams to life. The wait was worth it. (Even <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/scandinavian-white-ikea-kitchen-design-remodel-photos-266002">Apartment Therapy </a>thought so, as they covered the transformation as well!)</p>

<h3>Removing walls to create space in the kitchen</h3>
<div class="desc simple-text tt-content">
<p>Melissa worked with her interior designer, Danielle Herman of Persephone’s Spring, and a Sweeten general contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish a kitchen plan</a> and open up the space. The walls blocking the kitchen off from the living area were the first to go. Fortunately, the impact was instant: the room immediately brightened up. To take advantage of the newfound light, she chose a mix of materials, including matte <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concrete floor and counters</a>, to balance out the stainless steel appliances. “The goal was to reflect and refract the natural light,” Melissa shared. White Ikea cabinets and floating shelves contribute to the airy and spacious look.</p>
<p>A new peninsula offers additional seating while a built-in nook holds mugs, trinkets, and books. The location of the appliances remained as-is, but without the walls, the cook space <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a better flow</a>.</p>

<h3>The team brings a Scandi-style kitchen to life</h3>
<p>Melissa’s designer worked hand-in-hand with her Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor executing the vision</a> and selecting finishes, paint colors, and other details. Her contractor also had worked on many apartments in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a>, so he knew what to expect in terms of plumbing and support walls. “He knew ahead of time where the bodies were buried, so to speak,” Melissa said. He provided a detailed breakdown of the job, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a>, and timeline, and &#8220;stuck to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her only regret of the project? <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not doing it sooner</a>. Melissa wakes up every day excited “and delighted to return to cook dinner.”</p>

<h3>Our minimalist vision</h3>
<p>My goal was to turn the apartment into an understated, functional, and cohesive space that wasn’t over-designed—something comfortable and cozy but tidy and calm. I’m tired of the Scandinavian look and of white floors, so I chose dark floors and hardware throughout to contrast with white walls.</p>
<div></div>

	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>To make things unfussy, bright, and cohesive, I used similar colors, light fixtures, and hardware. The furniture is neutral; color would come from my artwork and our eclectic accessories. Plus, I had to account for my son’s colorful toys, which would end up looking even more disruptive in a visually busy space. Building out the closets was essential to allowing us to settle in properly, and I’m glad we didn’t wait to do this (which was the original plan). We had our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiator covers</a> custom-designed to be very minimalist so that they concealed the support legs and included a removable door that allows us to access the control.</p>
<h3>Solutions and revisions</h3>
<p>When we purchased the apartment, the wiring wasn’t up to code, so we knew we needed to replace the electrical panel. Tile floors had been covered in synthetic carpeting. There were no closet doors, few overhead lights, and a popcorn ceiling.</p>

<p>We made several changes during the process and added quite a few things to the scope of work, such as new doors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> the living room walls, and installing new closet interiors, creating space and storage. It added several thousand dollars to the job, but we are glad we did them.</p>
<h3>Opening up the kitchen</h3>
<p>The biggest part of the project was making the kitchen wider and extending it to include more storage. We wanted an open space with a large island for doing art projects and for cooking prep, and so I could see and interact with my family more.</p>

<p>We wanted the kitchen design to be invisible, minimalist, and to reflect the light and view. I spent a lot of time thinking about understated cohesion; I love the stone in the kitchen and find it calming. The stone on the island is one slab and so is the backsplash. I paid extra to have the stone vendor carry the slabs up 17 flights of stairs. It was crazy but having a seamless backsplash and island is worth it.</p>
<p>We had custom-designed cabinetry and I especially love our broom closet with a pull-out rack and an integrated outlet. Like I said, I wanted things to be functional!</p>

<h3>Bathrooms inspired by old New York</h3>
<p>The <span style="color: #333333;">bathrooms</span>, too, were designed to be functional and safe with lots of drawer storage and thermostatic controls on the shower. It’s a huge improvement from the existing controls where we had to mix the water to find the right temp. New hardware on both vanities was swapped out and added legs to the cabinets. I chose handmade Spanish white subway tiles; each tile is unique and has an interesting shape. I picked classic black-and-white tiles, shaker doors, and molding that are reminiscent of old NYC apartments. The chair rail trim adds texture.</p>

<h3>Homeowner tip: Hire an interior designer if you can</h3>
<p>The project was stressful on several levels: I designed the space and even though we’d done a renovation in a previous apartment, this job was much larger. I planned every detail and all the materials. We needed to ensure that we had enough material, which involved a tremendous amount of legwork. Additionally, I also coordinated their timely delivery and made sure we got our permits on time by getting on the phone with the expeditors, some of whom were causing unnecessary delays.</p>
<p>All of this was happening while I was working full-time and had a young child. If you can hire a designer whose aesthetic you trust to select all the materials for you, then do it!</p>

<h3>An organized general contractor</h3>
<p>We were lucky, too, that our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor was on top of things. Aleks created a project timeline, which was helpful. He was careful to check with us on all details before moving forward with work. Additionally, he also suggested a few vendors that we ended up using. The on-site foreman was excellent and communicated well with me.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-38489" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-04-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-04-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>Now that the dust has settled, though, I love my home and appreciate all the details and hard work that went into it. It’s satisfying to realize a vision and get to enjoy it as a family. We love our view, the open kitchen, the balcony, and, of course, the space is so functional! I really feel like it has everything I need.</p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing your renovation story and the beautiful results!</em></p>

<h3>The magnetic pull of a quaint neighborhood</h3>
<p>When my husband Sergio and I started our home search, we were living in a one-bedroom rental apartment on the Upper East Side, where he had lived for almost ten years. Motivated by a desire for more space for our daughter, Lara, we began to look for an apartment to buy. During our search, we kept returning to Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn. I had lived in the borough for many years and was keen on moving back. We were drawn to its small-town neighborhood vibe and proximity to Prospect Park.</p>

<p>We purchased an approximately 1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath co-op in a lovely prewar building. From the beginning, we knew we wanted to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/easy-dining-room-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dining room</a> in the entry where we could gather friends and family for dinner since both of us enjoy cooking and hosting.</p>
<p>Shortly after closing, we looked to <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten to find a general contractor</a>. After meeting with several, we decided on a general contractor. He was terrific and willing to work with both our budget and strict timeline for the project. The renovation was expected to take about 10 weeks.</p>

<h3>A galley kitchen that multitasks</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> was, without a doubt, the biggest part of the renovation. There were upper and lower cabinets on both sides and an open space at the far end, which could accommodate a small table and chairs.</p>
<p>Since we were already planning for a dining area outside of the kitchen, we didn’t need a table in the kitchen as well. We opted to have lower cabinets run the length of the room on both sides, giving us more storage and tons of counter space. Upper cabinets were installed on one side, while custom wood shelves ran along the length of the room on the opposite side, making the kitchen feel wider and more open. The wood provides a nice contrast to the all-white kitchen, as well as some open storage and a place to display artwork.</p>
<p>With our new larger kitchen, we&#8217;ve been cooking a lot more, including lamb tagine and homemade pasta. We&#8217;re hoping to start making bread as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-38059 size-full" title="kitchen sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-11.jpg" alt="kitchen sink with bar seat" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>We selected glossy white cabinets to reflect more light. The Caesarstone counters are white with a light gray marbling and the backsplash tiles are a white matte hex. We decided to replace the linoleum tile floors with wood floors. Our Sweeten contractor did a great job matching the flooring design and color to match the wood floors in the rest of the apartment, which created a nice sense of continuity between the spaces.</p>
<p>And finally, we created a small bar area with stools, since we now had so much more countertop to work with. This has definitely become one of our favorite places to hang out in the apartment to read and have coffee in the morning while one of us cooks. Lara loves it too; sometimes she&#8217;ll sit at the counter and draw and other times she&#8217;ll want to help us prep some items for cooking.</p>
<h3>A dining room emerges with space planning</h3>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38246 size-full" title="dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-07-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace Brooklyn dining room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-07-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-07-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-07-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-07-v2-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;We created a small bar area with stools since we now had so much more countertop to work with.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Before the renovation, the foyer was a long, narrow area that we wanted to transform into a dining room. We removed two large closets in the entryway, which essentially doubled the size of that space. To compensate for the loss of storage in the foyer, we added additional storage in the kitchen. Now that we have a dedicated dining room that opens into the living area, we can display our artwork consisting primarily of portraits—a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-38050 size-full" title="bedroom closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-02.jpg" alt="bedroom with freestanding gray closet" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>In the master bedroom, we removed a wall of closets and cabinets that was added on at some point. We opted to replace it with a freestanding wardrobe instead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38051 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03.jpg" alt="white bathroom with black fixtures and subway tile" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03-723x1084.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Creating a black-and-white bathroom</h3>
<p>The bathroom was fairly small in size, so our goal was to make it feel as open as possible. We installed a wall-mounted sink without a base and a slightly narrower toilet. Fortunately, there is a closet in the bathroom so storage was not an issue. Above the sink, we installed a large mirrored cabinet with LED lighting, which also helps make the room feel a bit bigger. We kept the color scheme a simple black and white with black fixtures.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-38052 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-04.jpg" alt="white bathroom with black fixtures" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-04-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As first-time renovators</a>, we greatly appreciated how responsive our Sweeten contractor was to our calls and emails throughout the renovation. In the few instances where something needed to be adjusted or redone, he was willing to take the extra steps to make sure we were satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p>Overall, we are really happy with the finished product. Our new space feels open and has a great flow. We were able to keep many of the original prewar details that attracted us to our Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn. We absolutely love our new kitchen and bathroom. We feel lucky we were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched up with our contractor</a>. He was honest and clear with us throughout the process in terms of what would and would not be possible and what the costs would be.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Increase storage and counter space in a Queens, NY, kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Ed, a buyer for a retail department of a major New York City museum, purchased a sponsor apartment with his late wife, Kate, in Jackson Heights, Queens, nearly 16 years ago. (A sponsor unit is a unit or an apartment owned by the original owner or corporation responsible for turning a building from a rental into a co-op.) The kitchen was made up of cheap materials they knew someday they’d want to replace to fit their taste.</p>
<p>“We were pretty enamored by the bungalow/Arts and Crafts/Mission style, given that our building was built around the end of the ‘bungalow boom’ and the neighborhood shared a similar, working middle-class ethos,” Ed said. Otherwise, storage and the lack of counter space were a big issue for them. They came to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32386" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a>, and were matched with a general contractor.</p>

They moved the fridge to another wall, but otherwise, the layout remained the same. A radiator on the west wall presented a minor design challenge; their contractor suggested working around it by leaving a space open beneath the countertop.</p>
<p>Most of the project went off without a hitch and any issues that popped up were solved quickly (or planned ahead for). When the contractor went to pick up the quartz slab for their counter, he discovered it had been damaged in the warehouse. To keep the renovation on schedule, he texted Ed photos of other, similar options he found. “What we picked actually ended up looking better,” Ed said.</p>
<p>The renovators hoped when they removed the vinyl flooring, the wood underneath would be in good enough shape to keep. It turned out the adhesive used to affix the subfloor ruined the fir floors. Their contractor had thought ahead though, and had a flooring supplier save oak planking just in case. Since they had such a great experience and their contractor handled every issue that popped up, Ed shared he didn’t feel the need to contact Sweeten’s Client Services.&#8221;It speaks very highly of Sweeten’s contractor assessments that nothing came up that need your intervention,” he pointed out.</p>

<h3>Lessons Ed learned post-renovation?</h3>
<p>1.) Have a cleaning crew lined up.<br />
2.) If you’re renovating your kitchen, make sure you have alternative places to have your meals in mind. 3.) Make sure your contractor has multiple suppliers he/she works with. Luckily, theirs did, but that might not always be the case.</p>

<p>While Kate and Ed worked on the plans for their kitchen together, she passed away before she could see it come to fruition. “The kitchen is almost entirely Kate’s conception,” Ed said. “It really feels like I’m living in her vision—it’s really comforting.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: A custom drawer has exactly enough room to hold Ed’s Celestial Seasons tea tins.</p>
