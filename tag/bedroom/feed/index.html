			<h2>These master bedrooms ideas from Sweeten renovators showcase unique design trends that produce a serene space</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49071 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg" alt="master bedroom with black and white painted mural behind bed" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
While most home renovations focus on the kitchen and bath, the bedroom is arguably just as important. Although bedrooms are key spaces for retreating from the stress of everyday life, they&#8217;re often deprioritized during renovations. Updating a master bedroom—even with simple refreshes—can have an outsize impact on how we enjoy our homes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re seeking master bedroom ideas to guide your design dreams, look no further! These Sweeten renovators turned the spotlight on their own master bedrooms, using unique design approaches to refresh their favorite space in the house.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</p>
<h3>A Hollywood star&#8217;s much-needed nook</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="master bedroom with lounging bench at the foot of bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46813 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-14.jpg" alt="custom built-in closets in bedroom with lounging bench by window" width="1000" height="701" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-14-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-14-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Dreaming of a special, cozy place to call your own? If you have the room and your space is configured correctly, consider adding a reading nook. They are great places to allow you to relax and unwind. Plus, they look beautiful as well. For <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> actress <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime Ray Newman,</a> a geometric-patterned bench provided not only a nice nook but a statement piece in her master bedroom. With natural sunlight beaming through and luxurious curtains, who wouldn&#8217;t want to curl up with a good book and spend a relaxing afternoon?</p>
<h3>Bedroom accent walls draw the eye</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41431 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg" alt="master bedroom with blue paneled accent wall behind bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) Blue paneling as a bedroom accent wall</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49071 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg" alt="master bedroom with black and white painted mural behind bed" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>): A custom mural as a bedroom accent wall</span></p>
<p>Making a bold design statement is always an in-vogue idea in any master bedroom. A statement or accent wall has been around for a while—and they are not going anywhere. You can add an accent color with paint. Or, take it up a notch with a paneling.  <a href="https://sweeten.com/portfolio/black-steel-accented-dining-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators Mitzie and Jenifer </a>decided on blue paneling to give the room depth and character. The wall also turned attention away from existing buildouts in each corner of the room and a recessed area that could not be reconfigured.  Also, in case you were wondering, the contractor used satin-finish paint to make the wall pop even more.</p>
<p>And yet another <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten renovator</a> decided to add an accent wall—a customized one. An artist, Katy decided to use her creativity in the design. She painted a bold, black-and-white brush-stroke mural behind the bed. &#8220;Seeing my murals and paintings transform the house has been incredible,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h3>Built-in shelves flank the bed</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43898 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg" alt="Attic master bedroom with custom built-in shelves surrounding bed" width="1000" height="665" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Built-ins are not just for the library or living room. Including built-in shelves to a master bedroom not only helps with storage but adds a point of interest. In the master bedroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovate-attic-pelham-westchester-new-topper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homeowners Kusum and David</a> asked their Sweeten contractor to install custom built-ins since they were limited on space. They decided on open shelving with a drawer at the bottom in order to maximize the storage potential. In addition, the odd-shaped room also called for a built-in dresser to utilize every nook and cranny.</p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall wallpaper</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39881 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13.jpg" alt="master bedroom with textured tan hemp wallpaper" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Wallpaper is an easy way to elevate the design of any master bedroom. The key to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picking the right one</a> really lies in your personal aesthetic. Overall, stay true to your style, whether that&#8217;s bold or more subtle. Another approach to consider is selecting textured wallpaper, which adds a sense of movement and purpose. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator</a> (above) went for a hemp-textured wallpaper. Specifically:  Bermuda Hemp in Elephant #5260 from <a href="https://www.phillipjeffries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phillip Jeffries</a>.  No matter which paper you choose, keep true to your design aesthetic and you won&#8217;t go wrong.</p>
<h3>Minimalist master bedrooms go clean and simple</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39731 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg" alt="Minimalist baster bedroom with white walls and black window frame" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Whitney&#8217;s minimalist bedroom</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48341 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15.jpg" alt="Minimalist master bedroom with slanted white ceiling and walls" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Kirsty&#8217;s master bedroom</span></p>
<p>Sometimes keeping it simple is best. That usually translates to neutral colors, minimal furniture, and little ornamentation on the walls. Another bonus of the less-is-more approach: having a space that is mostly clutter-free can make you calm and more relaxed. Ultimately, that&#8217;s just what a bedroom should be—a serene, inviting space. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-time-condo-renovation-flatiron/">Sweeten renovator Whitney</a>, that was exactly her vision. She chose light wood flooring that appears to reflect the incoming sunlight, having an illuminating effect on the bedroom. White walls are accented by a black window frame. Art is leaned up against the wall instead of hung. And little furniture works to make the space more open. This master bedroom is just the right combination of minimalism and style.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator Kirsty</a> had the same idea: minimal all the way. When she redid her house in Los Angeles, she, too, wanted a clean aesthetic, especially for her bedroom. She achieved this through natural wood doors and headboard as well as little to no furniture in the room. She used artwork to draw the eye in but it is also in neutral tones and hues.</p>

<h3>Setting goals for a new home</h3>
<p>We bought this house with dreams of a live/work space that would reflect our style and offer plenty of room for our art collection. Steve is a painter, so having his studio at home was a life-long dream. We also wanted a place where our friends and large extended family could come together.</p>

<p>We are Steve DeFrank and Lewis Holman. Steve teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. Lewis is self-employed as a tax accountant. We sold our loft condo in Williamsburg after living in it for nearly 15 years to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchase a small townhouse</a> in the South Bronx.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>From a two-family to a single-family rowhouse</h3>
<p>The engineer&#8217;s report on our 1882 rowhouse in Mott Haven, the Bronx, looked good, but we still wanted a gut renovation. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure has three stories</a> comprising roughly 1,500 square feet. The home had been divided into two apartments and had eight rooms on two of the floors. We wanted to renovate and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to a single-family home</a> to accommodate a live/work situation.</p>

<p>We listed our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/bronx-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design-build services in the Bronx</a>. Sweeten’s introduction to our Bronx contractor and architect was a valuable service. As first-time renovators, our biggest question before starting was how much <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overhauling the home would cost</a>. the project were about cost. In addition to an in-home studio, we wanted to open up every floor of the building, giving us fewer walls and more windows. We understood that altering the building in this way would be an investment.</p>
<p>The plan we made with the architect was for the ground floor to be Steve’s studio and a water closet—a bathroom with the sink outside. The middle floor would be the living and dining rooms, plus <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a customized kitchen</a> and a half bath. On the top floor would be our bedroom and a home office/guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a remodeled full bath</a>, and a laundry closet.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for a true gut renovation</a>—nothing was in good enough shape to retain. Our Sweeten contractors demolished down to the bricks and joists, all of which had to be replaced or sistered; this was necessary to allow removal of the central beam, which had to be done to open up the ground- and middle-floor spaces.</p>
<h3>Radiant heat and functional stairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the home, we aimed for low-maintenance, design-worthy materials to evoke an aesthetic of warm minimalism. We wanted expansive wall space for hanging artwork. The ground-level studio interior is an open workspace with recessed LED lighting, a lot of artist’s storage, and radiant-heat flooring—which we installed on all levels. To bring as much light as possible to the studio, we opened the rear wall with an 8’ x 9’ three-panel glass sliding door.</p>
<p>We decided to remove the original front stoop and relocate the house’s entrance to the ground floor, which created some challenges. Our architect Shannon envisioned—and our Sweeten contractor produced—a storage unit that divides the entry area from the studio space. We had hoped to save the original interior staircase and railing, but our Sweeten contractor showed us options that made more sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we closed the stairs from the ground floor to the first to create more wall space in the studio; we chose a vivid pink hue for the risers, which brightens the whole entrance. On the parlor and top floors, we went with a wood stair-rail that looks simultaneously classic and modern. In the end, we were very happy that we took our contractor’s advice.</p>

<h3>Connecting all of the floors</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision for the kitchen</a> included custom millwork with the front panels painted green evoking the palest verdigris. Our island, which has an angled front, is an homage to artist Donald Judd. We rented nearby during renovations and observed this living area coming together. Visiting the site at least twice a week, we loved seeing the gradual progress, sometimes glacial and sometimes lightning quick.</p>

<p>A dining-area drawer and shelving system provides storage and connects these rooms to the top floor, where the main bedroom and home office also employ coordinating storage units. We had fun with tile to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernize the full bath</a> upstairs, where we mixed matte and glossy tile in a range of sizes and colors, including chartreuse, dark green, and gray-green.</p>
<h3>A building exterior refresh</h3>
<p>The elimination of the parlor-floor entrance led to an anomaly on the front of the house, with regards to the living-room windows. The window occupying the old door frame is much larger than the window next to it. The architect’s solution—a modular window design, made up of a series of smaller frames, one of which mirrors the smaller window to create a visual connection.</p>

<h3>Steve and Lewis’ renovation advice</h3>
<p>Throughout the job, we enjoyed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborative exchange with our contractor</a> and architect. As first-time (and last!) renovators, we’d embarked on possibly the most stressful project of our lives. Luckily, we had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen the right team</a> carefully. Our contractor and crew kept a sense of humor during a long, arduous process.</p>
<p>Our advice to other <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners ready for a renovation</a>: Anticipate bad news and delays, and roll with the punches. Be grateful for the opportunity you have, even when you wonder why you ever thought it was a good idea! And remember, issues that arise and seem monumental during the process get solved, and are forgotten once you move in. Now when we enter our home, we feel serene.</p>

</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Laying out the plan for high ceilings</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners closed on an 850-square-foot loft apartment in a multi-building complex in Greenwich Village, just a short stroll from Washington Square Park. The building dated to 1890 and had formerly housed a cast-iron factory. The apartment itself benefited from the structure’s history with high 16-foot ceilings and original detailing. The interior finishes were outdated, however, since it had been decades since the last renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47451" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg" alt="loft homeowner" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They planned to convert the one-bedroom apartment into a two-bedroom while making full use of the ceiling height. A mezzanine level around much of the apartment would allow for storage and display of their art and decorative pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen was tucked away in a dark corner of the loft, with dark wood cabinetry and black countertops adding to the gloom. It made more sense to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap the locations of the bathroom</a> and the kitchen. This brought the kitchen closer to the the dining and living spaces. The bathroom itself needed a gut renovation. Its finish materials and all the wiring and plumbing were deteriorating.</span></p>

<h3>Out with the debris, in with the light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As their Sweeten contractor began to demo the space, he unearthed&#8230;actual earth. The contractor found about eight inches of “some kind of dirt floor” beneath the flooring. He had to excavate it along with the rest of the demolition debris—a first for this seasoned contractor. He speculated it was perhaps due to the building’s past as a factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They worked to create a gallery-like space featuring bright white walls, highlighted with blackened steel accents. Keeping the finishes simple allowed the airiness of the space to shine.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47435" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="loft renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47437 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>A triumph of clerestory windows</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there are now two bedrooms rather than one, the homeowners were able to preserve a sense of expansiveness by not taking the walls all the way up to the ceiling. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clear glass clerestory windows</a> were installed</span><span class="s1"> in the bedrooms, as well as in the bathroom so that natural light could still shine in each part of the renovated loft. </span></p>
<h3>An integrated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the hallways, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, a steel rail was installed for a custom library ladder, to give access to the mezzanine areas. This unique system used brushed steel for the rail and brackets, and black-anodized aluminum for the portable ladder, to make it light enough to carry from room to room. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Storage-12-scaled.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the living room lost a few feet to create the second bedroom, it gained plenty of linear feet in display storage as a result of the loft renovation. Custom black steel bookcases run along the length of one wall. The contractor secured these shelves through to the studs as they were rebuilding the apartment, so they&#8217;ll be able to handle any load. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The living room space opens up to the dining nook, which also houses an upright piano. An <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g2262/gallery-wall-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjacent gallery wall</a>, decorated with black-framed art, provides visual interest along the interior wall. Recessed lighting and statement pendants support the minimalist aesthetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47429" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47433 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg" alt="library ladder" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<h3>Extra storage for the bathroom</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the smaller bedroom next to the kitchen, they created a lofted sleeping area for guests with a simple mattress set-up, which is also accessible via the library ladder. The elevated sleeping loft allows the floor area of the room to be used by the homeowners as a closet and dressing area. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47427" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg" alt="loft bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom received a similarly modern treatment with a deep soaking tub. A matte black towel hook and shower and sink fixtures create contrast, and match the overall black-and-white motif. Unusually, the homeowners were able to add storage above the shower area, also accessible with the portable library ladder. As with the overhead kitchen storage, the space above was built without shelves or compartments, to accommodate large or odd-shaped items. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple now has a beautiful home that handles their storage, showcases their art and treasures, lets in the light—and even lets them share their space with overnight guests.  </span></p>

<h3>A house flood sets off a new start</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sometimes you can spin a disaster into an opportunity. That’s what happened with Hildreth Place, our house in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition/">the Hamptons</a>. We used a devastating flood as a prompt to create a happy, modern home where family and friends can meet. </span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hildreth Place has been in the Garry family for more than 40 years, and my husband and I have owned it for 10. The house is in Hampton Bays, New York, 50 yards from Meschutt Beach, where families gather to swim in the bay and live music plays every night at Tiki Joes. The house was originally built in 1970, in a traditional Cape style. We have long used it with family, shared it with friends, and <a href="https://katygarry.com/pages/hildreth-place-landing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also rented it</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Two years ago, all of a sudden, a pipe froze and burst. After discovering eight feet of water in our basement, we decided to go down to the bones and renovate. Our goals were to make the home more efficient from both energy and maintenance standpoints, all while turning it into something beautiful that our family and friends can enjoy.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A new chapter for a family home</span></h3>
<p>Cara Boyce of <a href="http://www.redwagondesignny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Wagon Design</a> partnered with me on the interior design and helped me reimagine the home. <span class="s1">We planned to revise the façade, giving it the relaxed appearance of a modern farmhouse, and meanwhile use the interior redesign to solve problems and increase our living space. With Sweeten’s help, we found the perfect contractor to help us with our Hampton Bays home renovation. Accordingly, he worked on time and within budget, keeping cost savings in mind and brainstorming solutions to construction challenges. This house had a few!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-14.gif" alt="garage renovation as living space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49060" /></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hildreth Place has endured quite a bit, and we needed to prepare it for the future. The house has been standing 50 years, and is close to the beach and exposed to the elements. Consequently, our biggest investment was on exterior improvements. The materials needed to withstand the environment. For instance, we installed James Hardie <a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/siding/21072512/all-about-siding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clapboard on the exterior</a>, invested in a fiberglass front door, and chose fiberglass casement windows rather than old-school wood. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A garage renovation turns into a lounge space </span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One of the biggest interior changes we made in modernizing was on the home’s ground floor. The first floor was very traditional for a beach house, and the formal dining room, which was in the front of the house, wasn’t practical for entertaining.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">By raising the roofline, we were able to add about 200 square feet upstairs, creating space for a center hallway.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49055" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6.jpg" alt="gallery wall" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p1">We decided to create an open floor plan that connected the kitchen to a walk-through dining room. It continued out to our attached garage. With the garage renovation, we stole just under 300 square feet to create a new inside-outside room. As a result, this “garage room,” which opens to the back via an industrial-style roller door, lets the indoor space flow to the outdoors, and is an ideal casual gathering spot for coming off the beach.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the second floor, there was another flow blockage to overcome: We had four bedrooms, including a big dormer for the kids, but the only way to access that bunk room was through one of the other bedrooms. It was an awkward layout for children trying to find the bathroom at night. By raising the roofline, we were able to add about 200 square feet upstairs, creating space for a center hallway. As a result of the resectioning, we also found us space for a master bathroom, a nice bonus.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Personalizing with color and art</span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Seeing my murals and paintings transform the house has been incredible. The master bedroom got a bold, black-and-white brush-stroke mural. I love it! I have a moody painting tucked between the shelves in the master bath and oceany pieces in all the first-floor rooms. A guest room with a bright bamboo theme features a hand-painted ceiling by me and is inspired by colors that I’ve been gravitating to—the combination of orange, hot pink, and red makes me happy.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Down on the first floor in the powder room, just off the garage, we added wallpaper—this Dorothy Draper look was a <i>dream</i> of mine. The undeniably lush green print and chartreuse ceiling color is the kind of pairing that inspires me as an artist. Such a surprise when you open the door! My recommendation is to always spend money on things that give the most bang for the buck. I told my husband that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the splurgy wallpaper</a> was more important than running water.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many of the room designs in the house are emphatically inspired by my paintings, as I really wanted to bring their joy into our home. One of the best examples of that is the “goldfish bathroom,” which is bathed in a dappling of water-blue penny tile and features several playful fish paintings. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49061" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15.jpg" alt="penny tile bathroom" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3 class="p3">Natural elements soften</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Correspondingly throughout the house, we also chose simple items to offset the highly visible ones.  We went with pre-painted cabinetry in the kitchen, and the same hardwood floors as in other rooms. The lights are modern loft pendants, clean in matte white.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’m intimidated by the process of picking out kitchen appliances, accordingly I let my mother-in-law—a holiday-entertaining superwoman—choose; she picked a single oven with the largest cubic heating space she could find.

<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with three general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socialize–that became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jim’s dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paint—now a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boys’ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. We’re not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36200 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-13-1.gif" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, custom closets, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was right—it’s a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didn’t initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner, Samantha</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We bought what was essentially a flip and closed on it the month before our oldest daughter, </span><span class="s1">now almost seven, arrived. We finished the buildout that became her bedroom the night before her birth. The apartment’s finishes weren&#8217;t our favorite, but we had our own place, and were a family. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom (with a creative-industry résumé); Jameson is a partner and the digital director at Athletics, a Brooklyn-based creative studio.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47279 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Outgrowing a home they love</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After having our second daughter nearly four years ago, we knew the apartment needed to change. </span><span class="s5">We </span><span class="s1">loved its location in the Clinton Hill Co-Ops and our hope was to extend our time in this place and the neighborhood. Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time</span><span class="s5"> to make this home more liveable for our family.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a design-build firm</a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tight—we were looking to renovate during our kids’ summer break and move back in before school resumed—and when we weren’t excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some who’d worked in our co-ops. That sold us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’m a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while I’m in the kitchen cooking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories I’d collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/unique-features-for-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome</a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t be afraid to ask for what I wanted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Previously, our daughters’ shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they weren’t soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed a sound-blocking pocket door</a> for the girls’ room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying we’ll wake them. </span></p>

<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. I’ve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be afraid to ask for what I wanted</a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.</span></p>
<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other rooms—we updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.</span></p>
<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art we’ve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love. </span></p>

<h3>Changing the entire floor plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our apartment, which was built in 1912, had almost all of the original details still intact. It was important for us to keep this character while adding a more usable kitchen and bathroom. The first objective was to get rid of the long hallway, which was tying up roughly 10% of the apartment. An added bonus: opening up the floor plan would bring more light in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34515 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg" alt="Park Slope homeowners Laura and Walter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>A new angle for the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we wanted to expand the footprint of the kitchen. ­The existing layout was <em>not</em> working: it was impossible to open the oven door without running into the sink. It was also difficult for more than one person to be in the space at a time. Everyone wound up standing in the doorway to the kitchen. We posted our Park Slope apartment gut renovation on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and got to work with our contractor.</p>

<blockquote><p>Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, the original kitchen and center bedroom were swapped. The apartment layout included a small angled section of wall in the center bedroom—now our kitchen. Enter our Sweeten contractor, who had this idea when he came to our apartment for the initial meeting. It was one of the primary reasons we decided to work with him. His instinct was to embrace this angle and open up the new kitchen more than the traditional 90-degree corner would allow. We lost a bit of floor space in our bedroom as a result, but the tradeoff was worth it.</p>
<p>We were able to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include both a peninsula</a> and a dining nook in the new spacious layout. A bookshelf fits at the end of the peninsula closest to the living room.</p>

<h3>Custom built-in cabinets are key</h3>
<p>Given that we wanted to squeeze five rooms and a bathroom out of our apartment, it was important that every room was laid out as efficiently as possible. The various <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built­-ins we added</a> allowed us to accomplish just that.</p>
<p>The built-in cabinets around the dining nook and drawers under the seating bench hide a ton of additional storage. Coming from our narrow galley kitchen, we were really excited to have a space big enough for us and our friends to hang out and cook in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34497 mb-0 size-full" title="white-and-blue-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" alt="white and blue kitchen cabinets with breakfast nook and built in bench after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space. Lowering the ceiling had the added benefit of the apartment drawing you in. It made the rest of the apartment feel spacious by comparison—a design trick inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #333333;">The den&#8217;s millwork could fit a full-size bed for the future.</span> </span>In our bedroom, the closets around the bed double as nightstands with­ the upper drawers on each side containing a hidden outlet.</p>

<h3>Choosing materials</h3>
<p>The footprint of our bathroom couldn&#8217;t be enlarged because of the location of the windows and the building plumbing. In order to maximize the space, we opted for a shorter tub to fit under the window, a wall-mounted toilet to free up floor space, and a wall-mounted faucet, which gives more counters space around the sink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" alt="bathroom tub" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34511 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Our goal was to use natural materials as much as possible. The oak floors were a tribute to the original parquet floors (we tried to save them, but they were too thin for another sanding). We designed and cast our own concrete sink (in a small rented workshop in Industry City) to fit perfectly. The subway tiles in the kitchen and bathroom were handmade, as were the dining nook pendants—all adding subtle character and texture to the spaces. We opted for a marbled quartz countertop and think it will last much better than the real thing.</p>
<h3>Renovation tip: Order materials early</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of unexpected situations arose: an old dumbwaiter shaft ran through our proposed kitchen, the floor joists needed replacing, and the gas pipe had to be re­run from the basement passing through three other apartments. In retrospect, none of these things should have been surprising in an old building. Our Sweeten contractor was with us every step of the way to modify our plans to deal with the unexpected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My best tip for future renovators is to have all the fixtures with long lead times and finishes ordered before the work begins. Nothing pushes back a project deadline like waiting for materials or having all work stop because the tiles are still on the truck.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11.jpg" alt="glass partition" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34504 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>In the end, we were able to keep the things we loved most about our original apartment while making significant improvements to our home for now and in the future. There are so many things we can enjoy now. The kitchen has become the center of our apartment, with friends able to hang out in the dining nook or living room while still being part of the conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The glass partition helps bring a ton of light into the apartment. The bathroom has gone from tight-for­-one to comfortable-­for­-two. We were very lucky to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find a partner in our Sweeten contractor</a>. After living in the completed apartment, we’ve yet to find anything we’d change.</p>

<h3>Moving mom closer to family</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to having her son, Alissa had worked in fashion and had a good eye for style, design, and finding a great value. So when it came time for her mom, Tatiana, to find, gut, and renovate an apartment, the two teamed up to take on the condo renovation in Westchester. Tatiana was both downsizing and moving from Port Washington, in Long Island, to be closer to her grandchildren. She concentrated her search in southern Westchester, about 30 minutes outside New York City. Alissa and her family live in Bedford, NY, so that location would provide easy access.</p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mother-daughter duo prioritized location and a great building with amenities, and also looked specifically for a rundown space so that they could do a full gut condo renovation. Tatiana also wanted a condo rather than a co-op; in case she ever wanted to rent out the property in the future, she didn’t want to deal with strict building rules and sublet policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment they settled on was a one-bed, one-bath condo measuring 975 square feet, located in Hartsdale, NY, in a condo complex with a pool, clubhouse, and gym. The apartment itself was outdated and the kitchen and bath were original to the building when it went up in the late &#8217;70s. Alissa <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> and the pair chose to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. Her mom closed on the unit and began the condo renovation in Westchester just a week later. Everything had to go—the floors and carpets, popcorn ceilings, walls, doors, and the entire bath and kitchen.</p>
<h3>Handling and ordering materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa and Tatiana decided that they would <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order all of the materials themselves</a>, so they could search for good values and have full control over the final look. Alissa explained, “We knew exactly the vision we wanted for the spaces. Working in fashion and living in NYC my whole life, I was able to go direct to the wholesale districts and find the best deals on items like the fixtures and other materials. This gave us leftover money to splurge on designer furniture and lighting!” The contractor took care of the demo, installation, and provided rough construction materials.</p>
<h3>Merging construction and style</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“My mom is very stylish and vibrant; we wanted to create a bright, airy contemporary space to match her style,&#8221; said Alissa. &#8220;We went for neutral gray tones with splashes of color.” In the living room, they chose a calming gray for the walls and floor-to-ceiling curtains, accessorizing with gold-toned finishes and brass furniture. A leather couch offers a grounding contrast to the animal print rug—both on-trend and grandchild-friendly. Dark gray wood flooring and Jonathan Adler lighting are seen throughout the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a more affordable solution, the contractor covered the popcorn ceiling with a one-quarter-inch layer of sheetrock rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoothing out the texture</a>, which would have been time-consuming and costly.</p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h3>Kid-friendly materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tatiana wanted her apartment to be “dressed” in a way that resembled her personal style: classic with a flair. In the kitchen, this meant going with a clean, bright white. Shaker cabinet fronts with nickel hardware were selected for their simplicity and mixed with open shelving as well as glass fronts. Stainless steel appliances complete the look. White and gray porcelain tile on the floor mimicked the look of marble without the price tag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining area, the mother-daughter duo was thrilled to find leather chairs in a bold cobalt blue at a Lillian August SONO outlet in Connecticut. Durable and wipeable, they are perfect for visiting grandchildren and sit around a dining table under a silver drum pendant light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They painted Tatiana’s bedroom in warm ivory tones, with blush pink velvet curtains and a comfortable armchair. The colors are calming, and the high-gloss sheen they chose for the paint “gives the walls a very lush feel and works really well with all the velvet,” said Alissa.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34252 mb-0 size-chrono" title="open-glass-panel-door-in-foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" alt="open glass panel door in the foyer opening to a white room after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The serene bathroom is in a similar color palette to the kitchen. The marble tile floors and walls complement a white vanity that has plenty of drawer space. Alissa and Tatiana accessorized the space with woven covered baskets for storage and to add a bit of warmth. They also reglazed the original bathtub and added a glass shower divider to remove the need for a shower curtain.</p>
<h3>Alissa&#8217;s renovation tip: Measure your appliances—and then measure again!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa shared with us a hiccup in the process: “Funny story—this was such an amateur move! Before the renovation started, we were online looking at kitchen appliances, got overly excited, and bought a refrigerator without taking the measurements first. My mom picked out the BIGGEST double refrigerator, thinking it would fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the appliances were delivered, the refrigerator did not fit through the front door! It was so annoying—the store had to take it back, and then we had to take very careful measurements and select another style to satisfy the space. After that incident, we measured and re-measured before making a purchase!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite that obstacle, the Sweeten contractor met the deadlines and even delivered the apartment a few days early. Since the project&#8217;s completion, Tatiana reports that “the new space is amazing, and I never want to leave!”</p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing your Westchester condo renovation with us, Tatiana!</em></p>

<h3>Deciding to renovate during COVID</h3>
<p>What do you do when a global pandemic hits in the middle of your home remodel—just as you’ve moved out of your house, with two babies under two years old in tow, to make way for the construction crew? Jaime Ray Newman washed her hands and pushed on.</p>

<p>“We were juggling a lot,” said the actor and producer, who had posted her project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in 2019 for the dream redo of her 1936 ranch home. “We were expecting our second baby. It was now or never to blow open and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redo the house</a>.” The Sweeten post stated a desire to “convert our old 1930s two-car <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage to ADU</a>,” also known as an accessory dwelling unit, (also known as a working studio, guest apartment, or multitasking hybrid.)</p>
<p>Jaime also hoped to do a space-reclaiming opening of her family’s living space. She shares it with her life and business partner Guy Nattiv, a filmmaker (they co-founded New Native Pictures and won an Academy for &#8220;SKIN&#8221;), their daughters Alma and soon-to-be Mila, and their dog, Kiwi. The project had been on her To-Do list forever.</p>

<p>“We’d been wanting to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert our garage since day one</a>,” Jaime said, “but had struggled with the permitting situation.” The area where they live in L.A. required single-family homes to have two-space covered parking. When the law changed, Jaime recalled, “We said, Let’s do this.” They decided to renovate the house at the same time. “We realized that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan, and a real closet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bath</a> for ourselves,” she said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46473 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg" alt="Jaime Newman" width="1000" height="1374" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-218x300.jpg 218w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-600x824.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The home &amp; garage renovation team takes shape</h3>
<p>Jaime, whose work includes winning an Oscar as a producer, playing a recurring character Elizabeth Manwill in Hulu’s <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> miniseries, as well as an essential district attorney role in Fox&#8217;s <em>Deputy</em>, had already gathered a reno dream team. “I bribed our dear friend Marcos Ferraez, a total visionary when it comes to imagining and reconfiguring a space, to come over and walk through the house,” she said. “We thought we needed to blow out the back of the house and add square footage, but we didn’t have the budget. I was stumped. Marcos completely reimagined our home within our current square footage.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going. But we were in desperate need of an office&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage space</a> was next. Jaime hired <a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer Haley Weidenbaum</a> to conceive of the layout and was stunned by Haley’s ability to maximize every square inch of the available 350 square feet. Haley also had a vision for the main living space, designing the primary bedroom and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. “Her talent and advice were invaluable,” Jaime said. From there she got on Sweeten and found her general contractor.</p>

<h3>Keeping family together during COVID</h3>
<p>Jaime was pretty clear on what she wanted. “I met with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple contractors</a>. What I liked most about the one we hired was that he had style. His taste was always on point,” she said. “He was also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very reasonable, and confident</a>.”</p>
<p>Like most of the world, the family had no idea of the uncertainty that lay ahead. For Jaime, in particular, early 2020 packed a punch. The COVID-19 threat loomed over the U.S. and then, she said, “my dad passed away in February.” Jaime wanted to support her mother and stay close by. It added up to difficult timing. “Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going,” she said. “But we were in desperate need of an office, and a separate space away from the kids so we could get work done,” Jaime said.</p>
<h3>Two designers for a Los Angeles garage remodel</h3>
<p>The project seemed to thrive on flux and change. “I realized at one point that much of our furniture no longer worked with the space, so we sold a lot of stuff on Facebook Marketplace to make room for new things,” she said. When Haley, who had started EVERHEM, a window-treatment company, got too busy and had to step away from the project, they brought in another designer.</p>

<p>“I have always had an Instagram crush on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madelynnfurlong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design consultant Madelynn Furlong</a>,” Jaime said. “I asked if she’d be game to take us to the finish line and re-think the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design of the house</a>. Her aesthetic is unique and she finds the most interesting pieces.” Through Madelynn, Jaime discovered amazing companies like Muuto, Industry West, Lulu and Georgia, Constance Guisset, and Hudson Valley Lighting, among others. And the designer knew how to find one-of-a-kinds.</p>
<p>“Madelynn sent me a link to a giant, vintage burl wood dining table on Chairish for a terrific price, and said “BUY THIS NOW,” Jaime remembers. “It weighs 600 pounds. When it arrived, the household was blown away. This work of art will be passed down to my kids!”</p>

<p>Collaborating with two designers with very different feels was the most fun and satisfying part of the process, according to Jaime. Through them (and Pinterest), she found the original pieces and touches she wanted to make the space her own. Especially bath and kitchen design ideas. “I wanted something fun for our kitchen backsplash and I’m obsessed with Fireclay Tile, so that was easy! The bathroom floor needed to be non-slip, so we picked a slate from Clé Tile that we loved. I also fell head over heels for a hexagon tile from Popham Design.</p>

<h3>What does renovating feel like?</h3>
<p>Asked about a renovator’s most important virtue, Jaime chose patience. The process is long, she said, but your memory is short once you are settled in. “It’s kind of like after having your first baby!” the actor jokes. Confidence is also key, she said. These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts. And <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a> whose aesthetic you love.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad we lived in the house for years before renovating it, so we understood our needs and how best to accommodate them within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a>,” Jaime said. Especially now, during COVID, she says, “We are in pure bliss here. The house is unique, but warm and inviting, a family compound and a comfortable respite. I cannot wait until we can have guests over!”</p>

<p><em>Guest post by Sweeten homeowner Rachel</em></p>
<h5>A Manhattan duplex remodel (instead of moving)</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is our first home, which we bought about six years ago just after we got married. When we were planning to expand our family, we knew we had to renovate or move. There was enough square footage, but we needed more distinct rooms or spaces. The apartment is a duplex co-op in Greenwich Village which was built in 1910. We love Greenwich Village so much and I really wanted to have the experience of raising a baby here. So, we renovated!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living here for so long before the renovation was really helpful since it gave us plenty of time to think about the best possible use of the space. We had a two-bedroom, two-bath, but wanted another bedroom for a baby. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old layout didn&#8217;t really work for entertaining</a>, either—the kitchen and dining room were upstairs while the living room was downstairs. Marco and I also wanted our own personal spaces within our home for his hobbies and for my closet/office. Overall, we hoped to create a comfortable family home that met everyone&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I always thought of our apartment as a hidden gem—a colorful, fun place where you could see a little girl growing up, sophisticated yet flexible enough to allow for events like playdates and parties. The general contractors we found through Sweeten were really amazing. On top of being creative problem solvers, they were incredibly nice guys!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The top floor would be a combined kitchen/dining/living area, so the kitchen needed to be functional but also beautiful enough for a dinner party. We hid most of the appliances behind paneled cabinets; an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; and snack storage were organized inside hallway cabinets outfitted with marble countertops. When we have family-style dinners, we set up the self-serve dishes and bar in those spaces. So, yes, you&#8217;re in a kitchen, but it&#8217;s also an elegant dining room.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>Customizing the almost-black kitchen</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I cook a lot and was so excited for the stove. I wanted one of those fancy French stoves that come in custom colors, but they are so expensive! Instead, I found one from a U.S. manufacturer for maybe one-third the price. (They also do custom colors.) The cabinet color was chosen to match the stove, so this appliance is &#8220;hidden,&#8221; too. We wanted something different from the typical all-white kitchen that would also complement the light wood floors. This almost-black shade is just a little more interesting than plain black. It took lots of trips to the paint store for swatches!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We put a lot of thought into maximizing space and brainstorming with our Sweeten contractors. We really pushed them to be creative. I just kept saying, &#8220;We need to hide the trash and we need a spice cabinet. Where can we do it?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t let up! The answer was wrapping the cabinets around the pillar and also where the lower cabinets end, which created a finished look. There were other details: I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with big molding</a>. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong with big molding. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few challenges, like the flooring. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, including completely refinishing the downstairs floors more than once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was the fireplace, which was very old and didn&#8217;t work. Our contractors figured out it was a faux fireplace that took up space for no reason, so it was removed.</p>
<h5>Matching new and old brick</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also needed to make our brand-new brick match with the brick from 1910. Our contractors came up with a solution that was even better than what we had imagined. We repaired some portions, which was very expensive, and painted the wall solid white, stripping that paint off layer by layer to create the current washed effect. That helped to blend the new and (very) old brick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom needed updating, too. It was really old with a weirdly-shaped, very deep, mini tub. We installed a beautiful regular-sized tub and shower tile I had seen in another project our contractors had done, which I loved. I pushed hard to put in a double-wide mirror, even though there were a lot of issues with making a recessed cabinet fit the space. I&#8217;m glad I persevered because it makes the room so much bigger.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>A bedroom transforms into personal hobby spaces</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marco and I have always believed in having our own spaces. We divided what used to be a huge bedroom into two separate spaces to create his office and my closet. Marco needed his own space where he could work on his hobbies without driving me crazy! He likes to do things that create dust and noise and play his music really loud. He works hard during the week, so he should have a place to do that! The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office is actually soundproofed</a> so he won&#8217;t wake the baby.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32176 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-couch-blue-wall-painting" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg" alt="blue couch and blue painting on wall and brick wall with metal open shelf" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Sweeten was great; they continually checked in with us. I knew I could go to them if there was ever an issue with our contractor. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you need to pick finishes in person whenever possible. It&#8217;s really hard to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like on a computer screen.</p>

<h3>Moving back to the city</h3>
<p>We relocated back to Manhattan several years ago after residing in the Midwest and South for work. It was simply time to return home to our families in the Tri-State area. Bob and I met in NYC while studying for our MBAs, and Bob grew up here. While away, we owned several single-family homes—a few we had renovated—so we weren’t strangers to the process. There was a high likelihood of renovating to make a space our own as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we started the buying phase</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44562" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>We rented for a few years until we located an apartment on the Upper West Side that would satisfy our love of prewar architectural details while accommodating modern living. Our home was purchased through an estate sale and we immediately started renovating. It had been updated in the early ‘90s, when the owners created an open floor plan of living room, dining room, and foyer which was a big draw for us. And there are two windows in every room except the bath, so the light was a huge selling point.</p>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mapping the &#8220;musts&#8221; for an empty nest renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Bob rents office space, I required a fully functional home office in a dedicated space. Also, a washer/dryer. We lived without them for a few years in Manhattan after having a laundry room in suburban homes, and we didn’t want to do that ever again. Both the kitchen and the bath needed better functionality and major cosmetic updates. Storage was essential throughout the apartment, as well as better lighting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our vision for the apartment was classic and period-appropriate but updated for today. We felt it was important to keep within the prewar aesthetic, including subway tiles, wood flooring, wide baseboard and door frame moldings, classic single-panel doors, radiator covers, and shaker-style cabinets.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44566 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-19.gif" alt="closet turn home office" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>More storage and a tip for staying cool</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary bedroom initially had a large double-door closet. We flipped it to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office. We created built-in drawers and cabinets, as well as added new closets to account for the one given to the home office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I loved ditching the tub for a large shower stall and completely rearranging the primary bath. We went for a custom industrial-style shower screen, mosaic floor tiles, and classic subway tiles with a twist: a crackle pattern. Plus a black metal grate for heat. The design worked.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in selecting and getting product delivered in time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electrical rewiring was not expected, but it had to be done. Then we replaced all the lighting and added ceiling fans in the bedrooms and kitchen. It’s a trick from the south because you can cut down on A/C bills. And it’s a plus in a prewar building where you can’t regulate the heat in winter.  We went for sleek, custom radiator covers that are great for display on top, too.</span></p>
<p>In the foyer, we extended the closet out by six inches and added shelving on top. So what was non-functional became completely utilized, with tons of space. We added bookshelves in the living room—we love books and are avid readers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44554 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="stainless steel kitchen counter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Enlisting Sweeten during a hurdle</h3>
<p>Bob would say the stainless steel countertops surrounding the range are a throwback to a &#8217;50s kitchen we had. Those tops are indestructible! It was the only design element he wished to have a “say” in. Bob is the expert in paint colors. I can give him a palette of 10 colors and he can narrow them down so that they flow together from room to room.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While we had renovation knowledge, every experience has its unexpected nuances. We were very relieved to have <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten as the backstop</a> when needed. It was great to have someone who could assist in holding the contractors accountable. </span><span class="s1">We had problems with the contractor with a leak after moving in. So parts of the kitchen had to be dismantled, the leak fixed, and put back together again. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> stood by us and made sure the job was completed correctly. </span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>When planning for the unexpected pays off</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wish I had engaged Sweeten to talk through the contract, which might have avoided several issues. Having a second set of eyes is never a bad idea! For example, while I was very specific on the type of cabinetry I wanted, we found the budget in the contract did not align with reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help alleviate the overage, I hit the sales.  Also, I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selecting and getting product delivered in time</a>. Additionally, we had allocated extra funds for overages and the unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our new home makes us feel joyful. Our daughter commented that the space is aesthetically a culmination of all of our past homes, with a bit of industrial thrown in. It’s truly who we are at this stage of life, a mix of the past and present: kids grown, empty nesters with a puppy in the house!</span></p>

<h3>A full gut renovation</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When we purchased our apartment, we knew that we were going to renovate it.  As someone who loves design, I saw the potential and welcomed the opportunity to take a space and figure out how to best make it work for our family of five including three boys (and two dogs). I did not, however, anticipate we would be undertaking a full gut renovation—and while we had renovated before, those projects were a much smaller scope.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2.jpg" alt="hiding tv idea" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Working with an architect</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we closed on our apartment, we began working with our <a href="https://www.jwarchitecturedpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Jessica Wetters</a> on how to change the layout of the apartment. The plan was to open it up and improve the light and flow. The living spaces would be connected as well as add a bedroom and a half-bathroom. It was clear to our architect that the apartment required a full-gut renovation and that little could be saved. After a few rounds of revising the plans, we arrived at a layout that achieved our objectives.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44266" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44277" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractor</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we found Sweeten, we began working with a contractor on the budget for the project and costs kept going up. We were at the point where we were cutting parts of the project that were important to us (like millwork) and making compromises we weren’t comfortable with in order to stay within budget. I decided to post our project on Sweeten. It would allow me to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add more cost estimates into the mix</a> with their network of general contractors and see if I had unrealistic expectations. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten matched us with three contractors, but after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewing this general contractor</a>, I knew he was the one for our project. Not only did he assure us that he could get us everything we wanted within our budget, but he promised that he would minimize the disruption to our lives and work with our aggressive timeline.   </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As soon as we hired him, things moved quickly and once we had all of the necessary approvals, we moved into a rental apartment. Demolition began</span><span class="s2"> in February and work was completed over the summer. </span></p>

<h3>Functional and modern</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The first decision we made was the kitchen. I knew I wanted a Henrybuilt kitchen. I love the functionality and feel of our kitchen. We also planned for a black wall in the living room using huge porcelain tile slabs to camouflage our TV and it turned out even better than I expected. I researched industrial factory doors to connect the living room and bedrooms, but it was over-budget (even the reclaimed factory doors I saw were $7,000+) so I had a door made with a similar look for a small fraction of the cost.</span></p>

<h3>Replacing the floors</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In addition to opening up the kitchen, foyer, and living room, we enlarged the size of our master bathroom and added closets in unused space in the master bedroom. Throughout the apartment, we replaced the hardwood floors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated the walls</a>, replaced the trim, replaced all of the lighting, and added millwork.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I told our Sweeten contractor that our rental ended in June and that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that—despite his strong recommendation that we hold off moving in. Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal—his crew set up a refrigerator in the middle of the apartment—there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4">The perfect finished product</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a couple of unexpected structural issues were discovered during demo that required changes to the layout, our contractor immediately contacted our architect and me and proposed solutions that ended up improving the project. Issues that could have induced panic and delays were addressed efficiently and proactively. Our contractor, our architect, and I met at the apartment nearly every week to discuss progress and make decisions to ensure that the project kept moving forward on schedule. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are thrilled with the results. We achieved exactly the look and feel we were going for and I firmly believe that the process went as smoothly and efficiently as it did, thanks to our contractor, his crew, and our architect.  </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Assessing a family&#8217;s lifestyle</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My husband, Dave, an information security professional, and I, an ICU physician, moved to New York after my clinical fellowship at Yale. We dragged our two kids to a 1920s two-family house, originally a boarding house, which we gave an initial surge of renovations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fast forward years later, we were really struggling with only one bathroom in the upper unit where we spent most of our time.  Dave and I knew the time had come for an attic remodel on our third floor. It was a quirky, converted attic space of approximately 700 square feet, which contained our three main bedrooms.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="staircase-to-front-porch" class="wp-image-43893 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1.jpg" alt="exterior of house with vinyl siding and staircase and porch with railings after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Fixing a general contractor dead-end</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Informed by local recommendations, we contacted four architects and a few major general contractors. Unfortunately, communication was disjointed, estimates were wildly different, and we kept hitting dead-ends. I was also weary of having contractors’ preference for discussing things with my husband, instead of me, the project’s decision-maker. This whole project was turning into a major headache, and we were discouraged. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4.jpg" alt="Attic bedrooms" width="1000" height="644" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43894" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4-300x193.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enter Sweeten. A fellow MOP (Mom of Pelham) and Sweeten&#8217;s former CMO, Randi MacColl, had posted one of Sweeten’s recent projects on Facebook. I messaged her with my saga. We were stressed we hadn’t found an architect and then a contractor to execute the plans. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Randi’s patience with my vent was amazing, and her solution was even better. Sweeten’s team literally addressed every frustration we had been facing with this third-floor renovation project. They immediately walked me through setting up a profile to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with vetted contractors</a> and supported the entire “dating” process to bring life to our vision of the space. </span></p>
<h3>The wishlist for an attic remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That vision was complicated. Space was tight. Storage was minimal. We dreamed of having a master bath in our bedroom. The current bathroom was a crawlspace but the plan was to envelop Dave’s closet to maximize the square footage for a full bath. We requested contractors through Sweeten for just the bath project. In our minds, however, we hoped for so much more—new floors, built-ins, millwork, etc. My husband’s wish list included dealing with a perpetual leak, insulating cold spots, reinforcing weak floorboards, and new windows. And little did I know that he was thinking about exposing the dry-walled chimney. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5.jpg" alt="Attic bedrooms in Pelham" width="1000" height="696" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43895" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5-300x209.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5-600x418.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">They also had to work with an angled ceiling and what was behind it. Fortunately, our Sweeten contractor was all over this.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We met with a very manageable list of contractor/architect pairs and got bids. In the end, we chose our Sweeten contractor because of his <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enthusiasm, experience, innovation</a>, and forthrightness in what he knew and did not know. The project quickly evolved from a single bathroom addition to a full-scale attic remodel, inside and out. A reworked floor plan also accommodated two new doorways. Our contractor suggested innovative built-ins in the master bedroom and the stairwell to maximize our floor space. </span></p>
<h3>Managing a challenging attic remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hiccups and crises along the way were numerous (as with any renovation to an old house), but both Sweeten and our contractor supported us through each stressor with patience and transparency. A big uncertainty was whether we could fit a bathroom with adequate height clearance that was compliant with building codes. They also had to work with an angled ceiling and what was behind it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg" alt="Attic master bedroom" width="1000" height="665" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43898" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10.jpg" alt="master bedroom storage with slanted ceiling" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, our Sweeten contractor was all over this. A huge skylight helped to create the appearance of height in the space. We installed a custom medicine cabinet with a sloped recessed cabinet, a sink console with an expertly trimmed corner, and sconces from the U.K. to accommodate the hip wall. (I now know more about hip and valley rafters than certain diseases.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We faced another problem with sprinklers, which were required for any third-floor living space renovation. Cost estimates ranged from the manageable to the exorbitant. Our start date was pushed two months late, but our contractors put together a timeline for completion that seemed doable considering we were still living in the space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, we moved to the first-floor apartment for six weeks, after which Dave and the kids left for the summer. Adding to the chaos, I was working in the ICU for a lot of the renovation period. Thank goodness for a dependable contractor and Sweeten for doing check-ins when I did not have the bandwidth to deal with anything non-clinical.</span></p>

<h3>Renovation advice from Kusum and Dan</h3>
<p><span class="s1">Reflecting on the project, I offer the following recommendations to other homeowners: a) set clear expectations of each person’s roles, timelines, and constraints; b) establish a mutually agreed upon vehicle/format of communication and a minimum frequency of contact—endless email threads are the worst; c) hire your own cleaning team, as your standards of cleanliness (especially with young kids) may be much more stringent than the contractors; and d) personality match between the contractor and the homeowner is important to make a project successful and enjoyable. </span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7.jpg" alt="Attic bedroom" width="1000" height="710" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7-300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7-600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Family comforts for a top-floor attic remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, the third floor has turned into a coveted space for our family. There is so much light! With the floors redone, light painting, recessed lighting, and new windows, the entire floor is welcoming and relaxing. My son&#8217;s elevated bed allows for plenty of storage bins underneath. My daughter has the perfect tween transition room, including a desk, privacy, and a creative space. We got a zen master bedroom and an entrance to our “own” bath. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I stated earlier, the project started with a much more limited scope, but because of code regulations requiring the sprinkler system and the decision to splurge for a significant amount of millwork, we went over budget. We made this decision to do so without pressure because of our Sweeten contractor’s transparency and strong communication. Both Dave and I were able to get all of the items on our wish list!   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6.jpg" alt="after of stairway" width="1000" height="1438" class="alignnone wp-image-43896 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6-209x300.jpg 209w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6-600x863.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This essentially makes this major renovation project #6 for us as a family. To be honest, I think we have at least 2 more to go (just don’t tell Dave). We’ll just <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call Sweeten</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Two sisters decide to renovate, again</h3>
<p>Prior to our new home, we were living in a smaller apartment in Sutton Place in Manhattan that was renovated and converted from a studio to a one-bedroom. After five years there, we needed more space but wanted to stay in the neighborhood and ideally find something that required some work. We liked creating a space that is uniquely our own and feels like a home.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<h3>The floorplan evens out</h3>
<p>A lot of people are surprised by two millennial siblings, planning a whole apartment remodel, with a traditional style. Our design influence comes from Chinoiserie and a lot of ginger jars! We love bold patterns and color: the only thing painted white is the kitchen ceiling. Our home is filled with antiques we’ve bought and a number of items from our grandmother’s house.</p>

<p>The original layout had changed into a space that wasn&#8217;t well-utilized. The biggest challenge was bringing back the layout to its original form while making tweaks of our own and highlighting the great view. Our main goals were to create a second bedroom, build a large closet for our endless clothes, and have a dining space large enough to fit a table for entertaining. The decor would pull it all together through striking colors, textures, and the cozy feel.</p>

<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Wood floors are so classic, you really can’t go wrong, so we weren’t as concerned with getting it just right.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The entryway closet was a bit of an eyesore. We decided to keep it and make it work in the dining area as a coat/linen closet. We designed the mirrored doors and it became a great way to add extra light and depth to the space.</p>
<p>The size of the master bedroom was cut down to allocate space for a shared 7’x10’ walk-in clothes closet. Storage is super important in a New York apartment so we wanted to make sure we had as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Seeking simplicity with character</h3>
<p>The kitchen stayed simple by choosing white cabinets and a white quartz countertop. We avoided a trendy cabinet style to ensure a classic look for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home value resale</a>. A green, subway tile backsplash, inspired by The Polo Bar, gave a pop of color. All of the fixtures were in a gold finish. The kitchen counter wrapped around and into the dining area with extra cabinets and a wine rack added below it. We like the aesthetics of it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43491" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg" alt="green tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43493 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>In the bathroom, we went for a standard white subway tile in the shower for resale consideration. It’s inexpensive, easy to maintain, and a classic material that won’t go out of style. Spending less on the subway tile also meant we could spend more on the marble basketweave floor tile, which adds a lot of character.</p>
<p>Initially, we were going to salvage the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood floors</a>. When we realized we couldn’t, we had to quickly choose a new style and decided on a medium finish with narrow planks. Wood floors are so classic, you really can’t go wrong, so we weren’t as concerned with getting it just right.</p>
<p>We managed the project while working full-time jobs. We had an idea of what we wanted but the execution for most of it was in real-time. Fortunately, we work very close to home so we were able to run over at lunchtime and after work to answer questions, make decisions, and check on the overall progress.</p>

<h3>The right general contractor communicates</h3>
<p>Constant communication with our Sweeten contractor was key! Although we communicated exactly what we wanted, it’s only natural that things get lost in translation. To keep everyone on the same page, we had weekly calls or meetings to make sure everything was getting done right and on time. We would also send checklists of completed tasks and any pending items.</p>
<p>Choosing the right contractor is the biggest question when starting a project. Having a referral or reputable source (like Sweeten!) is always a good idea. You don’t always have the luxury of starting from scratch where every detail is of your own choosing, especially in New York, so we really wanted to capitalize on that.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to finally have a dining room to sit and have meals (another NYC luxury). The wallpaper, chandelier, and doors were a must, since day one. We feel so happy to be settled and comfortable but are also really proud of how our ideas translated into exactly what we envisioned.</p>

<h3>Finding a dream-like duplex in the Upper East Side</h3>
<p>It takes just a word to sum up this family’s home-finding experience: miraculous. In the cosmopolitan stretches of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where even the parks are tiny and concrete-dipped, Jenn and Jon, six-year-old Elliott, two-year-old Abigail, and their Cockapoo, Zucca, found a place that can only have dropped out of a dream. The 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Yorkville, a tony area near the East River’s edge, was in a 1910 building a stone’s throw from Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor’s residence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43295 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43298" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg" alt="Duplex floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The story was that decades back, a former owner of the five-floor, then ten-unit building had combined three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. “W<span class="s1">e fell in love with the unbelievable backyard garden</span>,” said Jenn, the executive director of a family foundation, not to mention the amazing location. The problem was—and every Manhattan miracle has one—that the duplex needed renovation work.</p>
<p>From what Jenn and her partner, Jon, a lawyer at a bank, could see, little had been touched since the 1970s. The floors throughout were in poor condition. The white laminate kitchen was 40 years old and had an unfriendly layout. It was a daunting prospect for a couple with no construction experience, but before long, they were in contract. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their duplex renovation</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their design-build firm</a>, and jumped in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43220" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10.jpg" alt="Stairs in a duplex renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Plotting the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; for the duplex renovation</h3>
<p>Jenn and Jon planned on four months for the duplex renovation. &#8216;Apartment is in good shape and does not need to be gutted,&#8217; they’d stated in their Sweeten post. “We knew we needed a full reno on the galley kitchen,” Jenn said, “but most everything else just needed a serious refresh.” Light updates were given to the 2.5 bathrooms including the master, the kids&#8217; bath, and a half bath.</p>
<blockquote><p>We fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the “Must Do” list finalized, Jenn and Jon got to work with their Sweeten contractor’s design team. “We wanted a transitional-modern space that was light and airy,” Jenn said. “Our look, playing off of the brand-new white oak floors we were putting in and the existing black hardware like the stair rail and window frames, was ‘black, white, and wood.’” For inspiration, they followed the Instagram #BlackWhiteWood hashtag, which delivered great ideas.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Beginning in the kitchen, they got to work on what bothered them most: not old cabinetry, but two light-blocking openings that made the galley room feel closed off. The first was a partial wall between the eating area and the kitchen. The second, on the opposite end, was a too-small pocket door inhibiting flow to the living room. “The ground floor has only two natural light sources—the front kitchen window, which overlooks the street, and the garden door to the back—so this opening up was essential,” Jenn said.</p>
<p>By knocking out the divisive walls, they maximized light and flow, making the kitchen a focal point of their home and family life. “Having a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family was one of our priorities,” Jenn said, “and we fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43297 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg" alt="living room leading to outdoors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) First-floor family room</em></span></p>
<p>In the kitchen and the apartment’s other rooms, Jenn and Jon selected materials in classic styles, like Shaker cabinets and five-panel doors, but finished with a modern flair. “We said no to crown molding,” Jenn said, “and kept the four-inch floorboards natural by sealing them with a white-infused stain.” As planned, they riffed off the existing black hardware, but mixed in metals, including brass light fixtures and stainless kitchen appliances, to relax the overall effect. They were stymied by the choices—working across so many rooms, they seemed endless. “It was hard making so many ‘permanent’ decisions over a short time,” Jenn said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43221" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11.jpg" alt="Stairs in a duplex" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">They soon realized they would have to install new white oak floors throughout, since the existing ones were stained, warped, or patched with cheap flooring that had been laid down years ago. (“They were mismatched, different heights, just an overall disaster,” Jenn said.) </span><span style="color: #333333;">The stairs and risers, however, were sanded and stained to match the new floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiators worked</a>, but needed covers; the through-wall air conditioners screamed for an upgrade. The <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets would get built-ins</a>, and the family needed more shelves, nooks, and stowaways up and down. New doors and molding would be necessary. Oh, and of course they would paint—everywhere.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43228" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43223" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-13.gif" alt="bedroom closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A large bedroom on the second floor—that was once two separate rooms— would be divided again into two kids’ rooms complete with new closets in each. Their bathrooms, formerly a Jack-and-Jill with two entrances, had a wall built in turning them into two separate spaces once again. </span></p>
<p>“Jon was the one with the vision,” Jenn said. “We bought the apartment knowing it would need work to feel like our ‘forever home,’ but I was concerned going in about how much effort it would require.” They’d preferred a turnkey place but realized, having looked long and hard, that finding a comparable, renovated apartment they could afford, especially in such a prime location, would be near-impossible. And so, with a commitment to work together—because they’d heard too many stories of renovations tearing couples apart—they agreed to make it happen, in the name of a big, beautiful city home.</p>
<h3>Getting a hang of the renovation learning curve</h3>
<p>As first-time renovators, Jenn and Jon not only felt overwhelmed by the day-to-day, but knew little about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgets, timeframes, or permits</a>. “We went in blind and had to learn fast!” Jenn said. <span class="s1">Because of this, and due to large last-minute changes to the plan—including an unforeseen full-frame exterior backdoor to the garden and brand new solid hardwood floors throughout—they exceeded their budget by about 30%.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43217 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg" alt="Guest bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) Half bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p>Still, Jenn said, it was worth it. “Our new home has significantly impacted our quality of life. The garden, where the kids can run free, is the biggest contributor to that, but a fabulous eat-in kitchen and two floors for stretching out are big assets, too,” she said. “To us, the place lives more like a house than an apartment—we are truly in love.”</p>

<h3 class="p5">Landing the perfect space</h3>
<p class="p4">We had a clear vision from the day of the close: to create a living space with a look and feel of casual luxury. The building, in historic DUMBO, is a block from both Brooklyn Bridge Park and the waterfront. The apartment is a true two-bedroom—with windows and natural light in both—overlooking the street and trees. The price point was reasonable enough that we could buy the condo and have money to renovate before moving in. Mitzie is a furniture designer and we were confident the space was a good canvas. It would make a good home.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg" alt="open concept kitchen and living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41443" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p5">New home office, featured wall panels, coordinated bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p4">We were looking to add character to each room, with a focus on mixed materials and quality finishes. We were excited about renovating the kitchen as well as two bathrooms using the same tile in different ways. The master bedroom would be outfitted with wall paneling. Maximizing storage was key since Mitzie works from home. The second bedroom would be her workspace, and she wanted (needed!) to separate work from life with an office. We were determined to accomplish it all, transforming the condo into a home reflecting both our personalities and styles.</p>

<h3>A mood board emerges</h3>
<p>Once we’d hired our Sweeten contractors—and asked a lot of questions about costs and the timeline—we began with concept boards. These kept us organized with the number of decisions we had to make throughout the planning. We started with a set of detailed floor plans and measurements (CAD renderings were helpful for seeing the big picture). The color palette was off-white, blue, and gray, with accents of pink in textiles and black for hardware. We created a list of materials we wanted to incorporate such as marble, brass, and wood. All of these hues and surfaces are visible in our living room, which is the heart of our place.</p>

We installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/should-i-refinish-my-hardwood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white oak wood floors</a> throughout the apartment to lighten up the entire space. It has a subtle, scraped texture that feels wonderful to walk on barefoot. Since the same wide floorboards were used throughout the apartment, we eliminated the saddles at our door thresholds to maximize that continuity. We made a schedule for ordering materials and a checklist for received items—a system that carried us through the renovation, helping us track appliances, fixtures, hardware, and odds and ends.</p>

<h3>The key to open concept spaces: built-in cabinets</h3>
<p>The kitchen was a dark and boxy room that needed love. Our goals were to maximize storage, update the appliances, and simplify the overall aesthetic. This was especially important as the kitchen opens to our living room. A large island was a key addition, to function as a dining and entertaining area. We chose a refrigerator and freezer with panel doors matching the cabinets. On the other end of the kitchen wall, our contractors removed the door frames holding the washer/dryer for a streamlined effect.</p>

Our apartment was filled every day with a team of busy contractors and subcontractors. It surprised us, but once the project was complete, we missed seeing and chatting with these talented guys.

<h3>Wall paneling defines a plain wall</h3>
<p class="p1">Wall paneling was added to give our bedroom depth and character which became a feature. This accent wall moved the attention away from some existing buildouts in each corner of the room, and a recessed area that could not be reconfigured. Our contractors hired a master carpenter who created the wall paneling with 2 1/2&#8243;-wide lengths of plywood, and finished the wall with satin-finish paint. In this room as well as the second bedroom, which became Mitzie’s office, we added custom closets and remote-control blinds. Mitzie’s plants in her office were outfitted with grow lights to keep them green year-round.</p>

<p>We found a great tile company and chose the same style for the floors in both bathrooms but installed in different patterns. Our big goal for the master bath was to add a double vanity—a tight squeeze and ultimately a feat, since we didn’t find a 60-inch-wide unit with storage that we both liked. The vanity we chose has no cabinets, but luckily, during demolition, our contractors pointed out an extra 6-8&#8243; in depth between the wall studs—space for hidden storage. The carpenter who’d created the bedroom paneling custom-made a four-door, concealed built-in. The shower recesses and door saddles are cut from the same marble slab as the kitchen countertops.</p>

<h3>During the renovation process</h3>
<p>Throughout the renovation, our Sweeten general contractor proved critical in the job’s technical aspects. Their invaluable suggestions included creating a dropped ceiling to add recess lighting, hiding wires and cables, adding electrical sockets and USB plug-ins, and installing dimmers. Our apartment was filled every day with a team of busy contractors and subcontractors, including painters, an electrician, a carpenter, and a plumber. It surprised us, but once the project was complete, we missed seeing and chatting with these talented guys. Sweeten helped us find our renovation team and advised us on important points like timelines and communication strategies.</p>

Mitzie and I didn’t know how hard conveying a bathroom-tile design over FaceTime could prove—the flooring almost broke us up! But a five-month renovation is survivable, even when in the end you are living out of a suitcase at a dear friend’s house. In the end, we were thrilled with our relaxed and beautiful apartment and proud of our role in making it.</p>

In this blog post, we visit the couple in the second phase of the project. To recap: They’d purchased a historic brownstone with “good bones” on a quiet street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. They were aware that the circa 1910 building was in need of a total interior gutting and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted contractors.</p>
<p>What they didn’t expect to learn was that the wooden beam that had brought essential stability to their brownstone for 100-plus years suffered from rot. They’d hired both a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect</a> and a Sweeten general contractor to drive the overhaul. Once the couple had installed the integral metal beam running through their long-sought brownstone, they were initiated. Moving walls, installing a kitchen, and replacing splintered floorboards were achievable tasks. They were pros.</p>

They would have, once finished, three units to rent as well as their own top-floor studio pied-a-terre, which they planned to use as a second home. A key goal was to preserve the building’s prewar details while streamlining and modernizing the interior spaces. They also wanted to create bigger, brighter apartments and therefore planned to convert the building’s traditional two-bedroom configurations to one-bedroom layouts. The project also included opening up the kitchens and enlarging the bathrooms. All applied to the ground-floor garden apartment.</p>

<p>The initial plan for the fireplace was to remove it—although the mirrors were original and in good shape, it&#8217;s doors were damaged and the pillars didn&#8217;t suit their aesthetic. Their architect suggested they &#8220;<span class="s1">repaint it and open it up to the brick in the bottom area, &#8220;Jerry said. &#8220;We really like how it turned out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>They also preserved as much original wood flooring as possible which were stained and discolored, including the inlaid mahogany borders. &#8220;<span class="s1">We were surprised when both our Sweeten architect and contractor said that the living room floors were salvageable,&#8221; he said. The width of the boards was no longer made but &#8220;t</span><span class="s1">he contractor went out of his way to find a warehouse with a supply of vintage floorboards to fill in gaps and match to the existing flooring,&#8221; Jerry said. </span></p>

In this apartment, she and the architects decided to move things around, shifting the kitchen forward and the bath back. By reshuffling the spaces and putting the kitchen adjacent to the living room, they were able to create a kitchen island that floats on the edge of the living space. The quartz-topped island has counter seating, making it great for quick breakfasts and weekend gatherings; it incorporates an under-counter sink and is lit by a pair of modern pendant fixtures. The shiny stainless-steel hood and dishwasher are from IKEA, as is the gray cabinetry. “We really like the geometric tiles we chose for the kitchen backsplash,” Jerry said.  They add unique character and dimension to what is now a highly visible wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40747 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40757 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-14.gif" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Putting the kitchen here opened up what had formerly been a hallway, lined with inset wall cabinets. The doors of these units had been painted a bright chartreuse green—not the couple’s color, but there was a character to them that they wanted to preserve. The contractor stripped the paint, resurfaced, and repainted the doors to look almost new. <span class="s1">&#8220;We are very happy with the restoration of the cabinets,&#8221; Jerry said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great feature for the apartment—it adds so much storage space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Janet loves how the original doors, now bright white, add a historic touch and some concealed storage to the wall facing the kitchen. The contractor installed new shelving and additional drawers, too, to increase the cupboards’ sleek functionality.</p>

<p>Going for a more open layout really worked in other ways, too, with their old-new aesthetic. The revamped kitchen’s modern appliances are a great contrast to the fantastic old fireplace that is the living room’s most notable feature. They kept it, had the contractor replace the broken display door and window with a very close match, and repainted its mirrored mantel.</p>
<p>The kitchen’s relocation also did wonders for the bedroom, which is at the apartment’s rear. Having opened up the space, they expanded it further by eliminating the rear portion of the apartment’s narrow floor-through hallway and a tiny water closet next to the garden door. When all those walls came down, they had a large, sunny bedroom, flooded with light but completely private. There was room as well to build a large, sliding-door closet with built-in shelving.</p>

The fixtures and hardware, including the faucet and an open train-rack shelf, nod to the traditional. The couple stuck with the elongated shower tile they had chosen for the other rental units—like subway tiles, but stretched—and went with a large rain shower head to add modern luxury to the large stand-up shower. The hexagonal floor tiles are repeats from upstairs as well.</p>
<p>From the front door to back, the apartment came together beautifully, and Janet and Jerry have their Sweeten team to thank. Jerry recalls that the general contractor, who managed the timeline and the subcontractors from one phase into the next, did an excellent job communicating and keeping the project on schedule. “We found the company honest and responsible for the quality of all work,” he said. “At one point, when we felt like some of the workmanship was sub-par—some newly installed tiles in the bathroom were cracked—the contractor acknowledged our complaint and worked to fix the issue.”</p>

<p>Sweeten also matched them with an architect. Prior to tapping the service, they were about to hire an architect they found on a chat forum only to discover the architect had a less than stellar reputation.</p>
<p>Jerry said that the fact that this has so far been such a smooth project is almost unbelievable, given that on closing day he’d had no idea where to start looking for a good, honest contractor. “Without Sweeten, I would have randomly chosen a company I found on my own,” he confesses—and may or may not have had success.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had the peace of mind of having the service &#8220;be the middleman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;W</span><span class="s1">ith Sweeten, the contractors are more accountable. Suddenly, my experience and satisfaction matter much more which is great.&#8221;</span></p>

The apartment is gorgeous, livable, and comfortable. “Soon it will be rented out to a lucky tenant,” Jerry said, “and we’ll move to the top floor.” Check back to see how Janet and Jerry make the upstairs apartment their own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"> A new layout reveals a design that is just right</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ting and S. moved back to their New York co-op after four years of living abroad, Ting, an architect, had an opportunity to remodel the fixer-upper they had been renting out. They now had a 6-month-old, so not only did they need a second bedroom in their almost 1,000<span style="color: #000000;">-square-foot space</span>, but they also needed to make more efficient use of wide hallways and under-utilized closets. The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to bring in additional bids to a few other contractors they found through friends. At decision time, the duo chose to hire <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor</a> to begin building their new home. </i></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For an architect, renovating your own home is both a dream and a rite of passage. So when it came time to purchase our own apartment, I secretly hoped we’d find one with enough square footage but in desperate need of TLC.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We decided on Midtown Manhattan for the location, so we could both walk to work, and after months of searching, we found a large one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op, nearly a thousand square feet in a postwar building that fit the bill perfectly: it had a smart layout that featured a windowed dining alcove; three poorly-utilized but large closets; and extra wide hallway with doors that just gathered dust. The finishes showed significant wear and tear as well: the kitchen was so outdated it had metal cabinets, its linoleum floor tiles were crumbling under our feet, and the bathroom’s blue tiles were screaming for a change. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But thanks to the 80/20 carpeting co-op rule, the parquet flooring was in great shape! In short, the original owner had not done much in the half a century she&#8217;d spent in the apartment, and we were happy to take on the challenge and make it our own. </span><span class="s1">We’d decided to live in the apartment for a while before renovating it, but just a few months into our blissful home ownership, S. a journalist, was offered a job transfer to London. I hastily put away my plans, packed our bags, and moved across the pond.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fast-forward four years and a tenant later, we came back to New York City with a 6-month-old in tow. We felt the urgency to renovate more than ever before. I knew I had my work cut out for me. I also had just started my own design practice to work from home—what better way to show my work than to live in my own design? </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">S. and I have similar tastes: we like clean lines, and simple, classic materials and color palettes. He has a penchant for mid-century and I have a soft spot for modern, but it was not difficult to marry the two. We chose a white base palette, accented with mix-and-matched metal hardware to create visual interest but not clutter. With the low ceilings in a postwar co-op, the color palette really helped to brighten the space. The real design challenge we faced was creating an additional bedroom and utilizing the storage spaces more efficiently.</span></p>

The result? A perfect two-bedroom home with a roomy open kitchen and living space for entertaining, a large bathroom to accommodate a growing family, a cozy baby nursery, and a king-sized master bedroom with a walk-in closet!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it came time to selecting a contractor to carry out our dream-home renovation, I first asked my friends in the field to recommend contractors they have worked with. In the meantime, while searching online I came across Sweeten’s website and immediately thought, &#8220;What a good idea!&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After reading testimonials, I decided to post our project on the site. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why not get a few more bids to compare!</a> Despite our relatively small scope (I only posted the kitchen and nursery as Phase One), we were matched with four contractors to start, and, after speaking with each one on the phone, I decided to interview two of them in person, along with a contractor recommended by a friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When I first met our Sweeten general contractor, his calm demeanor and knowledgeable answers stood out among the rest. Matching these qualities was his higher bid. Sweeten helped us level the bids across the final two, vouched for his quality, and we are glad we picked him! He acted as a true partner during this entire renovation, worked with my design challenges enthusiastically, and delivered a home that we couldn’t be prouder to call our own.</span></p>

Our contractor was always able to find solutions to each problem. Luckily, the only major hiccup was having to upgrade the entire electrical system. At the end of the day, it took less construction time than it took to obtain permits and approvals; we were even pleasantly surprised to finish ahead of schedule! I think in Manhattan that is unheard of! With Sweeten&#8217;s help, an architect&#8217;s dream home came true, I can&#8217;t wait to work on my next Sweeten project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Outdated units merge into a family home in Manhattan</h2>
<p><i>Megan and Zack thought a one-bedroom apartment would be sufficient space for them—and maybe a child down the line—when they purchased their home in a 1928 co-op building in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan. A year of living in the space, however, changed their perspective. The good news? Luck was on their side, as a one-bedroom next door became available. They set out to combine the two apartments and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885"><i>posted their project on Sweeten</i></a><em>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. </em><i>With their contractor by their side, they reimagined a home fit for them and (spoiler alert!) their little one.</i></p>

<i>Guest post by homeowner Megan</i></p>
<p>When Zack and I came across a one-bedroom in a prewar co-op building in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, I convinced him we could “Marie Kondo” our lives and one day raise a child in the minimalist 600 square feet. As we went through the process of buying the apartment, sharing our entire financial histories, tax returns, and hopes and dreams for the future with each other (and the bank and co-op board), we began to affectionately call each other tenants-in-common.</p>
<p>The first time we entered our new apartment after closing, Zack proposed in the living room. Months later at City Hall, we discovered that it’s easier to get a marriage license than a mortgage.</p>
<p>A year into living in our new place, it became clear the apartment was in dire need of a renovation, and space would be tight if we ever had a child—even if we committed to the life-changing magic of tidying up. When we discovered the one-bedroom apartment next to ours was available, our “it’s so crazy, it just might work” plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combine the two units</a> went into action, and we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project on Sweeten</a>. Before finding Sweeten, the sketchiness factor of finding a contractor was a bit high for our comfort. In contrast, Sweeten’s process felt legitimate and professional. We were impressed with the three contractors we matched with and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose this general contractor</a>.</p>

<p>Our original apartment had only one street-facing window, a single light in each room, and was very dark. Plus, it had bold wallpaper and flashy light fixtures that just weren’t our taste. The second one we bought hadn’t been touched in decades. Combining both of them would allow us to rethink the space to suit our needs and lifestyle. The new layout and recessed lighting allowed us to brighten up the space.</p>
<p>We made one kitchen bigger and eliminated the other to create a living room, and the former living room became our master bedroom. Our old bedroom became a nursery, although we called it a “guest bedroom” for the first few months so future grandparents wouldn’t get their hopes and expectations up. I found out I was pregnant about four months into the renovation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we wanted a clean, modern, and bright space. I grew up in a house with white walls and dreamed of the day I would have my own place with HGTV-inspired fun accent walls and bold colors. Yet somehow we ended up with white walls, which probably means I’m turning into my parents. The best money we spent was on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof windows and soundproof walls.</a> We used to be able to hear everything happening outside on the street, and the lack of noise transformed the space. Now, when we’re eavesdropping on people’s conversations outside, it’s on purpose.</p>

<p>The kitchen is beyond our wildest dreams of anything we ever expected to have in New York City. We wanted it to be completely uncluttered, so we built spaces in the cabinets for the microwave, dishwasher, and trash. The gigantic kitchen sink brings me joy on a daily basis. Originally, we were thinking a medium-sized sink, but our contractor pushed us to consider something bigger, and we’re glad we did. The sink has all sorts of inserts—a cutting board, colander, tub, drying racks, and Murphy bed (just kidding about the last one) so it becomes any type of prep-surface we need.</p>

<p>We took advantage of an awkward corner to install a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in breakfast nook</a>. It’s become our go-to place for eating meals and working. Plus, it’s a natural gathering place and a cozy use of an oddly-shaped space. For the pantry, we used an Elfa system to create a miniature sewing room with a designated desk and outlet in there for my sewing machine.</p>

<p>The ice and water dispenser on the door of our refrigerator also has an outsized impact on our daily lives. After wasting years of our precious youth waiting for water to drip through a Brita filter, it feels like a miracle to have ice and cold water tumble effortlessly into a glass.</p>

<p>Both bathrooms stayed in place, though the one in the original apartment became our master bathroom adjacent to our new bedroom. My parents are updating their own house to be “aging-in-place” so we decided to put a walk-in shower instead of a tub in the guest bath, and used door levers instead of knobs throughout the apartment. We also installed hand showers in both spaces.</p>
<p>An image on Pinterest inspired the walls of hexagon tiles in our guest bathroom.  I loved how the classic shape was being used in an unexpected way. As someone who hates to scrub grout, using dark tile and gray grout in the shower seemed like a win-win for laziness and classiness.</p>

<p>In our new master bedroom (formerly our original living room), we wanted to maximize the minimal natural light. I read that light colors can make a dim room seem smaller, so we decided to paint the walls and ceilings a rich navy. That, combined with the blackout shades, makes for a very cozy sleeping environment. Along with the kitchen lights, the master bedroom lighting is voice-controlled. Having smart lights started out as a novelty, but became so useful once we had a baby to carry around. We may not have a flying car, but lying in bed and telling a robot to turn off the bedroom lights is our version of living in the future.</p>

<p>Our former bedroom is now the guest room and nursery. The neutral color palette, mixed with fun prints on the walls, makes it the perfect space for both. An architect friend suggested barn doors for the office to let more natural light into the whole apartment too.</p>
<p>We’ve watched enough home improvement shows to know that the unexpected is to be expected. Sure enough, we discovered pipes in a wall that needed to be re-routed and had to change our plans for the guest bathroom toilet when we found a floor beam in the way of our plumbing. With each surprise, our contractor kept us updated and came up with workable solutions. He was very upfront about what our options were and what the changes to our original scope of work would cost.</p>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor has a really good eye for design, and anytime we were in doubt about a decision, we followed his advice. From the soundproof windows and tile selections to the kitchen counters and a square toilet (surprisingly comfortable!), he never steered us wrong. We also appreciated how our contractor kept us updated; he set up a WhatsApp group chat which allowed us to easily communicate throughout the whole project, and we had weekly meetings face-to-face.</p>
<p>Having started this project as a couple and finishing it with a baby in tow, we can say that it’s faster (and cheaper) to create a human life than to renovate an apartment. That said, keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There is a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family.</p>
<p><em>We hope you love your new home, Megan and Zack!</em></p>

<h3>Falling for a new Manhattan neighborhood</h3>
<p>Sonali, a consultant, and Shalaj, an investment banker, were initially unsure about their move to the Financial District in Manhattan, but soon found themselves falling in love with the neighborhood. “We enjoy going on long walks along the river and just exploring the shops and restaurants in the area,” Sonali said. One night, while walking their cocker spaniel, Tyson, the couple discovered the Southbridge Towers complex, which had recently been privatized. Although they hadn’t considered buying before, the building piqued their curiosity. They started going to open houses and putting in their bids but were outbid several times before finally being accepted for a 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom co-op. “Truth be told, we were not expecting our offer to get accepted!” Sonali said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36162 size-chrono" title="floor-plan-design-changes" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plan sketch of rooms before and after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the two settled into their new roles as homeowners, they said, “reality hit” and they realized the apartment (with its original &#8217;70s design) would need a complete overhaul: a gut renovation. “We had no idea where to start,” Sonali said. Luckily, that’s when they found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their Financial District renovation</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“We needed to renovate the entire apartment, including the removal of the original popcorn ceiling. We wanted a contractor who would not only handle all aspects of the renovation but also fit within our tight budget and schedule,” she said. The project would also include knocking down walls, which required permits from both their building and the city. They were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a> who was comfortable with their project scope and timeline.</p>

<h3>Expanding the kitchen, and compromising along the way</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali and Shalaj agreed that the most important change to tackle would be opening up the <span style="color: #000000;">kitchen</span>. “We both enjoy cooking and having friends over, so we knew we would be spending a lot of time in there,” Sonali said. They decided to remove a kitchen wall to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open the space</a> into the living room and make the whole apartment feel less cramped. They went with a white-on-white design, with white cabinets, a white subway tile backsplash, and white quartz countertops throughout (which Sonali called “exquisite”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of installing a microwave over the gas range, they opted for a drawer-style instead. &#8220;It reminded Shalaj of years of renting!&#8221; Sonali said. Another item they really wanted was a Wolf gas range. &#8220;It was way beyond our stove budget, but when our contractor told us about a discounted floor model, we decided to splurge on it,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An unexpected delight in the kitchen was the under-cabinet LED lights with dimmers, suggested by the contractor, which both added charm and accentuated the white subway tile backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the process, the couple found they had to compromise on certain elements. For example, because of the location of the gas line, they couldn’t move the stove away from the peninsula as originally planned. Sonali found the silver lining, though: “We like that the stove is in the peninsula now because it allows us to cook and interact with guests when we have them over!” They spent most of their effort and money on the kitchen. “We have not regretted any of our decisions yet,” she said.</p>

<h3>Adding closet space to the co-op</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next renovation priority was to double the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet space</a> in the<span style="color: #000000;"> master bedroom by taking the adjacent guest bedroom&#8217;s closet; the second bedroom got a new one of its own built. “In our last rental, Shalaj was relegated</span> to the living room closet, so having enough storage space in the master bedroom was pretty high on his list of priorities,” Sonali explained. Shalaj wanted to install lights in their custom closets, but once they realized this addition would add thousands of dollars to their renovation costs, they decided to buy battery-operated lights instead.</p>

<h3>A bathroom refresh &amp; pet-friendly wooden flooring</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to close up the living room closet and have it open inside the <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom</span>. This change added <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> to the bathroom and got rid of wasted space in the hallway. Like the kitchen, the bathroom was also mostly white. To add contrast and character, they installed black hexagonal floor tile. “We get complimented on it a lot!” Sonali said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the rest of the apartment, the contractor installed wide-plank, oak hardwood floors. Sonali described the color as “not too dark, not too light” and loves that it blends with Tyson’s fur—something relatable to any pet owner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choosing materials</a>, Sonali said that the couple had no idea how many choices there would be or how much it could end up costing. That’s where their contractor came in: “To help us work through our sticker shock, our contractor had carefully built a list of items in three categories (budget, standard, and high-end) and supplied samples, to the extent possible. From there, our job was mostly to choose one of the three options provided, which made life so much easier for us,” she said.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned from the Financial District renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most stressful moment of the renovation came a week before the couple was supposed to move into their new apartment. None of the appliances had been installed, there was paper all over the floor, and the electrical work had not yet been started. Since they were unable to stay in their old apartment, they worried they might not have anywhere to go. The Sweeten contractor reassured them the process wasn’t very far behind schedule, and sure enough, they were able to move in on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our contractor took great control of the project, from getting building approval to ensuring that we could meet the move-in deadline.” She added, “We had heard horror stories about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how long renovations</a> can take, but working with an experienced and responsible contractor makes the process much smoother.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s advice to new renovators? “A friend of ours had advised us to set aside a 30% buffer on top of our budget. The advice came in handy as that was almost exactly the amount we went over by.” Extra costs included a few items outside the original scope such as replacing the AC unit and also spending more on kitchen materials than had been initially planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali said, &#8220;We love our new space and feel lucky to find a home in our favorite neighborhood and to add our personal touch to the layout and materials.&#8221;</p>
