<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Demolition, amount of work, a home&#8217;s condition, and alternate living arrangements all affect gut home renovation costs</span></h2>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A different level of owner commitment comes with a gut home renovation than a smaller renovation project. Here, Sweeten provides some guidance on points to consider when planning a major project like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What’s involved in a gut home renovation?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, let’s define the term. Gutting a home is more than an extensive remodel. It’s taking the walls down to the studs, removing existing interior doors and trim, cabinets, sinks, and exposing the structure of the home. It often includes replacing windows and exterior doors, the roof, and replacing most or all plumbing and electrical. Gutting is about the material removal before you remodel.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A renovation budget overview</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Costs of materials</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ll find Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation cost guides</a> here but keep in mind material costs and timelines have shifted. Prices for materials and labor have jumped, drastically in some cases and in some locales. It’s a good idea to add 20% to the materials budget and talk with your contractor about timing, materials, and budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Do not wait. Many sectors are experiencing a backlog in the supply of materials. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices may continue to go up and your material order will be at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">“Must-haves” and “Nice-to-haves” lists</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When making your project budget, it’s important to create a renovation list of “must-haves.” These are elements that are definitely required for the project, then make a second wishlist of “nice-to-haves.” This includes all of the changes you’d like to see but might be willing to forgo as you consider your budget. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A home’s existing condition</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s also crucial to be realistic about the condition of your home, as the cost of a gut renovation can vary considerably by the condition of the structure. Updating the mechanical systems such as the electrical panel and old plumbing can range from straightforward in a dated foursquare house to challenging in a home located in an historic district.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ask your contractor about worst-case scenarios given the building’s age and history. Consider the budget contingency that will give you peace of mind when your project kicks off. Your contractor can’t price out every possible surprise, but you should feel confident that you have a partner who will help you problem-solve when challenges come up.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Have a contingency plan</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners undertaking serious gut remodels should build in an extra cash reserve for issues that come up along the way including issues that come up once the walls are broken into. Add more than 15% for a gut remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathrooms contain the most plumbing and fixtures per square foot so tend to be the most expensive spaces in the house per square foot. Kitchens are next, then the other living spaces follow.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Should you leave or stay during a gut home renovation?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most important considerations is <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deciding where you’ll live during the project</a>. Nearly anything is possible, so you probably <i>can</i> remain in the house during the project. However, nearly any other plan is preferable for most people because you’ll almost certainly have to deal with surprises. You might discover a need for structural reinforcement, or unveil mold or asbestos, and decide then that you should reside elsewhere for a while. Also, if you do choose to stay during the project, you’ll need to make sure that you’re legally allowed to do so, too. Your city’s building department is the place to inquire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just remember that if you decide to stay in the home during the project to save money, you’ll still incur costs, and they could be substantial. Financial costs include delaying the project because you or your things are in the way. Non-financial costs could include a strain on daily family routines such as finding alternatives for when a kitchen or shower is being renovated. All those can result in financial costs, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your contractor will guide you through the cost for permits and regulations associated with your project, such as placing dumpsters. If your home is in a homeowner’s association, they will also have requirements to meet.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Demolition before renovation</span></h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">The demolition part of gutting a home is mostly labor and disposal costs, so it’s not really that expensive but removing plumbing pipes and drains and so on takes time. O</span><span class="s5">utsourcing the demo or doing it as a DIY project doesn’t really save much money. For safety and hazard concerns, Sweeten recommends leaving demolition to the professionals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note that moving walls is not included in these costs. Moving load-bearing walls requires consulting with a structural engineer, and that could be $500—$1,000. Whenever you change walls around you’ll need to build temporary support walls, so there’s another cost to add in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During demolition, you may discover hazards like asbestos, lead paint, and mold. If you do, a pro will evaluate how extensive the problem is. These hazards are not DIY-friendly. In some places, you’re not legally permitted to deal with these dangerous materials, especially asbestos which can only be handled by a professional.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The general contractor brings subcontractor connections</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, managing an extensive construction project like gutting a home is challenging and benefits from having an experienced general contractor. A general contractor usually has steady and long-standing connections to many subcontractors, so communication often goes smoothly. They will orchestrate and schedule between architects, engineers, plumbers, electricians, and other skilled labor. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architects <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-work-with-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specialize in bringing ideas to fruition</a>, and they must communicate with homeowners at a high level. An architect must have a crystal-clear vision of how to transform the current home into the space you dream of. Getting the input of the architect as early in the process as possible will be invaluable in helping you mentally walk through the steps in advance. Sweeten design-build firms have in-house architectural services. Alternatively, Sweeten contractors can refer an architect if the project needs one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gutting a home is a major project. Having an understanding of the process with the guidance of the right general contractor and team sets you on a path for a smoother renovation. And a step closer to your dream home. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With an abundance of Pinterest boards and design blogs, it’s easy to imagine how your dream NYC bathroom could look. If you&#8217;re ready to turn those daydreams into reality, the first crucial step is creating a bathroom remodel budget. To get you started, <span class="s2">Sweeten</span></span><span class="s1"> offers a roadmap of elements that will impact the cost of a bathroom remodel in New York City. Sweeten&#8217;s guide to bathroom remodeling costs, covering building requirements, permits, and design will help nail down your scope and better align real costs with a realistic budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in NYC</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take a look at the overall average cost to remodel a bathroom in New York City, based on Sweeten renovations:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Budget remodel: Starting at <b>$600 </b>psf (per square feet) or <b>$21,000</b> (based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Mid-grade remodel: Starting at <b>$700 </b>psf or <b>$24,500 </b>(based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">High-end remodel: Starting at <b>$850 </b>psf or <b>$68,000 </b>(based on a 80-sq-ft space)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in a bathroom renovation, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will continue to go up and your material order will start at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodeling an NYC bathroom all at once</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it can be tempting to apply à la carte prices to individual elements of the work, a full bathroom renovation is an integrated process that involves design, materials, installation, and plumbing. If your bathroom has one or two areas of concern, you might decide to swap out an individual fixture or two. You can replace a toilet or vanity or take on some limited retiling and pay solely for the cost of the new fixtures and the hours of installation work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, it can be misleading to break up and price out each step of a bathroom remodel. Even if you are just redoing fixtures and tile work, you may discover that you need to replace the sheetrock on the wall or address issues behind the walls, like old valves and ancient drain pipes. A gut renovation, which addresses the whole bathroom space, allows you to plan more broadly. By doing a gut renovation, you can get more work done, in the right sequence, and more cost-effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Budget to high-end costs for bathroom materials and finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Listed below are the visible parts of a bathroom renovation, and probably the aspect you’ve spent the most time thinking about. Review the range of pricing for various fixtures, materials, and finishes in the chart below. On the budget side, you’ll find items sourced from big-box stores like Home Depot, Walmart, or IKEA. Prices increase if you choose to use their interior boxes but upgrade or customize the function or style, such as the door fronts. On the high end are highly customized, handmade, or imported items.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How much will materials for a bathroom remodel cost?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Wall and floor tile</b>: Budget – <b>$3 per square foot (psf)</b>, Mid-grade – <b>$15 psf</b>, High-end – <b>$35 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sink:</b> Budget – <b>$50</b>, Mid-grade – <b>$150</b>, High-end – <b>$500</b> and up </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Vanity:</b> Budget – <b>$250</b>, Mid-grade –  <b>$1,000</b>, High-end – <b>$2,000</b> and up </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sink and shower fixtures:</b> Budget – <b>$40</b>/fixture, Mid-grade– <b>$100</b>/fixture, High-end – <b>$350</b>/fixture </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Bathtub:</b> Budget – <b>$150</b>, Mid-grade – <b>$600</b>, High-end – <b>$2,000 – $3,000</b> </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Shower enclosure:</b> Budget – <b>$350</b>, Mid-grade –  <b>$1,000</b>, High-end – <b>$2,000</b> </span></li>

<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Accessories</b> (hooks, towel bar, paper towel holder): Budget –<b> $10</b>/item, Mid-grade – <b>$50</b>/item, High-end – <b>$100</b>  and up </span></li>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel costs for permits, design, and everything behind-the-scenes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to visible upgrade items, there are unavoidable behind-the-scenes investments to consider when creating your budget.</span></p>
<h4>Building requirements impact bathroom remodeling costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those in apartments, building requirements can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to general <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/nyc-alteration-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">alteration agreements</span></a> that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s6">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Thomas</a></span><span class="s1"> explained, “Buildings are becoming less flexible on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to raise prices to keep up with those needs.” The contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands. </span></p>
<h4>NYC permit costs for a bathroom remodel</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing services: <b>$2,000 – $3,500</b> and higher </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as<b> $5,000</b> per permit </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tackling a NYC bathroom remodel means planning for plumbing services and permits. Any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture requires a permit from the City’s Department of Buildings, which can run up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as <b>$5,000</b> per permit. Plumbing is a specialized trade that often comes with hourly rates; expect to budget between <b>$2,000 </b>and<b> $3,500</b> (or higher) for a full bathroom remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re adding outlets or doing electrical work, an electrical permit may be needed, which can run close to <b>$900</b>. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on the building requirements and your plumbing plans, which cost <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b>.</span></p>
<h4>How design affects bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the design stage, plan to collaborate with the experts you hire to produce detailed drawings that account for all physical elements of the bathroom. A schematic drawing is usually presented to the building board as part of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">approval process</span></a>, which needs to outline the locations of the major fixtures as well as specifications for the vanity and tub/shower, and lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you plan to move the plumbing to convert a bathtub to a shower or vice versa, the permit alone to change the plumbing in NYC is <strong>$6,000</strong>. This is because you’ll need to hire a registered architect to file a permit application certifying that the plan complies with applicable codes and laws. An architect or interior designer will typically charge 15 to 20 percent of the project’s construction costs for his or her fee.</span></p>
<p>Sweeten general contractors can help provide architect referrals for a range of services, saving homeowners a step.</p>
<h4>Demolition and site prep for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this stage, labor is needed to ensure that your bathroom renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be disposed of, which can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. This difficulty will be reflected in the contractor’s rate. Almost without exception, your contractor may need to strip the walls and flooring to frame and level before any installation occurs. This behind-the-scenes step is critical and labor-intensive and can cost an average of <b>$2,000</b>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your home is new or the sub-floor is concrete, any leveling needs may be minimal. Otherwise, you probably need to account for floor leveling and new drywall or plastering before any surface work can get going.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exposing the existing conditions inside walls while leveling and framing will also allow your contractor to address plumbing or electrical issues before you hook up a new plumbing fixture. It may be necessary to replace all horizontal plumbing work to the building’s “stack” (the main vertical lines that run throughout the building) and run new wiring to head off plumbing and electrical problems that you may have unwittingly inherited. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll want to factor in costs that support the success and longevity of the work. Examples of this are prep work to protect floors and valuables (which can add <b>$600</b> to<b> $900</b>) and waterproofing steps (which can add <b>$1,000</b>). This is critical for the project’s foundation alignment and infrastructure.</span></p>

<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Installation is the final stage to incorporate all of the bathroom renovation materials you’ve purchased. The craftsmanship involved in the installation of all the pieces will depend on the size of your bathroom and the degree of customization you need to make all of the pieces fit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PRO TIP: Expect to spend 30 percent or less of your total project cost on visible materials, fixtures, and finishes. The rest will go to behind-the-scenes costs, like labor, permits, and fees.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes for a bathroom renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Raw materials for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid-related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurance, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-men crews to much larger entities that employ dozens of staff (including designers, project managers, millworkers and laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, however, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year, though not necessarily dollar for dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s7">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Aaron</a> explained that in the last year, there have been specific increases of compliance, certificates, and safety measures imposed on MEP subcontractors (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) by the Department of Buildings leading to higher costs. </span><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have a fair amount of choice in deciding what to spend on the material aspects of a bathroom renovation. Less obvious are the costs that are the backbone and labor of the work overall, no matter what you spend on materials. Knowing what impacts cost during a bathroom renovation will allow you to better align your budget while avoiding surprises. </span></p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">NYC bathroom renovations typically cost between $600 and $850 per square foot, depending on the level of fixtures and materials used. The finish level available from big-box stores like Home Depot and Ikea will put your renovation at the low end of the price range. Custom, hand-made, and imported specialty materials will push you to the high end.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1638353791087"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does it cost to retile a bathroom?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Not counting the cost of demolition (removing old tile and grout), count on paying between $3 and $35 per square foot, depending on the type of tile. Basic ceramic tiles will fall on the low end of this range (~$3 PSF). Most stone tiles, and higher-end ceramic tiles will land in the middle of the range (~$15 PSF).

</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Total Gut Renovation Costs for a DC Home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Washington DC that brings a home down to its frame and studs could start at around </span><span class="s4"><strong>$100</strong> psf</span><span class="s1">. Doing it all at once will get you the best price per square foot if you are already planning multiple projects. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a Washington DC kitchen remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A best-value kitchen remodel typically starts between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This allows the replacement of cabinets and countertops from big-box stores, a stocked appliance package, and tile flooring.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a mid-grade kitchen, expect starting costs between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This pricepoint would include semi-custom cabinets, hardwood floors, upgrade in appliances, and an island (with no sink).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found the average cost in the Washington DC area costs around <strong>$68,000</strong>. This works out to be <strong>$340</strong> psf. About 60 percent of the cost is recouped in the value it adds to your home. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/"><span class="s2"> adding a kitchen island</span></a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher are installed, must remain the same as the original design. Keeping your layout will be the biggest influence in a low budget down.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a high-end kitchen remodel, costs start at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> and include a stone or marble countertop as well as opening up the space or removing a wall.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A luxury remodel comes in at an average of <strong>$135,000</strong> for Washington DC, the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found. The psf cost is <strong>$675</strong>. This project can add 58 percent of the budget to your home’s value. A high-end kitchen remodel can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances would also kick up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. The kitchen can also have designer faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a DC bathroom remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a best-value bathroom, expect a typical project to start between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. At this budget, it would not be a gut but a refresh.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A mid-grade bathroom remodel has costs at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> or <strong>$600</strong> psf. These figures come from the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. For this price,  you can remodel a 35-square-foot bathroom. It includes adding a porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. This renovation can add <strong>$14,000</strong> to a home’s value. That’s 65 percent of the project’s cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A high-end bathroom remodel starts at </span><strong><span class="s3">$40,000</span></strong><span class="s1">. This budget includes a 3 or 4-piece bath such as the sink, shower/tub combination, and toilet. For <strong>$67,000</strong>, a 5-piece bathroom could be installed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the 2020 Cost Vs Value report, the average price in this category is around <strong>$67,000</strong>. For this price, you can expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/remodeling-a-bathroom-six-trends-to-consider-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new bathroom</a> can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. On top of that, you can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding square footage to your DC home </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enlarging living space to an existing floor plan starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf and can easily go up to <strong>$20</strong>0 psf. The most economical addition is adding square footage over a crawl space. An extension where you are adding or adjusting the foundations will come in around <strong>$150</strong> psf. The cost increases to <strong>$200</strong> psf if a wet space—bathroom, laundry, or kitchen—is added. </span><span class="s1">The cost of adding a second floor can start at <strong>$150</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Remodeling costs in DC: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District of Columbia is a compact city of only 69 square miles. The Council of the District of Columbia issues building permits for this area. Permits cost two percent of the budget for work over <strong>$1,000</strong>. For example, a permit for <strong>$20,000</strong> bathroom will cost <strong>$400</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prince George’s County, to the east and south of the city, uses an equation for <a href="https://princegeorgescountymd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23559/DPIE-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId="><span class="s2">permit fees</span></a>. <strong>$50</strong> + (Construction Costs x 0.008) = permit fee. So, a <strong>$20,000</strong> renovation would cost <strong>$210</strong>. Watch out for specific fees for projects such as basement finishing which is <strong>$340</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Montgomery County, the area to the north,<a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DPS/Resources/Files/IT/AllFees.pdf"><span class="s2"> building permits</span></a> for alterations, additions, and repairs start at <strong>$270</strong>.</span></p>
