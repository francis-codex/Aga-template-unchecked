<h3>Brightening up the space</h3>
<p>Racing to line up an ambitious renovation before closing on a dated co-op in Woodside, Queens, Maria, a financial reporting director at a major media company, and Eric, the owner and Creative Director at broadcast design studio <a href="https://www.generalidea.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Idea</a>, expected “pain and horror” as first-time renovators. They’d linked up with an architectural designer and came to Sweeten to find a general contractor to overhaul all 850 square feet of their new two-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>Some of the finishes were just plain uninspired, while other layout and fixture details limited a more holistic use of the space. Laminate counters and discolored floor tiles anchored the kitchen, warped cupboards demanded a good nudge to shut completely, and the small bathroom’s ornate pedestal sink went way overboard on frilly decorative details while way under-delivering on countertop real estate.</p>

<h3>Creating a team</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goals were pretty straightforward: open up the enclosed kitchen to the living room, update the kitchen and bathroom, and refinish the floors. Still, their designer, <a href="https://www.vidachang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vida</a>, brought three critical points of view to the project. One was technical and practical: to limit work to the existing structural and plumbing layout so that the crew could focus on visible details that mattered most. The second was connectedness: Vida posted the project on Sweeten to find local contractors matched to the project’s budget and scope, freeing her up to focus on design solutions. And the third was creative: clean design details and a minimalist style found in matte finishes, simple profiles, and rich walnut wood warmth. They were matched with their Sweeten contractor for demolition, rebuilding, and craftsmanship detail down to the new doorknobs.</p>

<h3>A gallery kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maria and Eric wanted an open, bright space with clean lines. They had drawn up a 3D model on their own to convey big ideas, and worked closely with Vida to fine-tune, leaning toward Scandinavian sensibilities with some mid-century modern touches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor&#8217;s team took on the kitchen wall, which sectioned the galley kitchen off in its own corner. To give Eric and Maria the open feeling they wanted, the designs called for approaching the two galley walls strategically. On one side, countertop prep space takes the lead, wrapping around the kitchen wall and extending into the living room with low walnut cabinet storage. Skipping the usual line of upper cabinets in this spot helps keep the living room open through to the kitchen’s window. On the opposite wall, full-height cabinets concentrate storage but still keep a low profile with matte white finishes and concealed hardware. The stainless Bosch appliances and a striking black sink and faucet combo star in this otherwise simple space.</p>

<h3>Making a space space feel bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom’s small footprint led the team to focus on storage solutions and a simple palette. High contrast black and white materials, a frameless mirror, matte black plumbing fixtures (even under the wall mount sink!), and recessed wall storage gave Eric and Maria a bright and uncluttered retreat. The floor tile was admittedly a splurge, but with just a few square feet of coverage needed, it made sense to focus a high-end finish in that small spot.</p>

<h3>Updated floors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room and bedrooms, the team stripped walls and focused on restoring the existing wood flooring. Getting the floors right was a challenge. Aiming for a serene, matte oiled finish required the team to strip the previous stain and try out a few approaches with a new topcoat. The new finish, a layer of natural sheen, is an updated take on the original material.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-53574 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06.jpg" alt="white on wood bedroom design" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Bumps in the road</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maria and Eric planned to use the second bedroom as a home office and needed to reframe the entry to open it up to the living room. The custom pocket door is their favorite design detail, a necessary addition after finding an unexpected structural beam which could have prevented the plans for a floor-to-ceiling entry. Vida suggested encasing the beam in walnut, with an asymmetrical line. It&#8217;s a beautiful and unique solution that helps tie in design touches from each room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-53585 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17.jpg" alt="open bright living room" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-53586 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-18.jpg" alt="Candid portrait of Sweeten homeowner reading at the dining table" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With their expert team in place, Maria and Eric found that communication was key. They had detailed conversations about measurements, finishes, and placement prior to work starting, saving time and headaches. Their contractor&#8217;s team helped keep the project on track and were key partners in addressing issues that came up as work progressed. Vida kept balance and prioritization top of mind to negotiate cost, quality, and lead times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And behind the scenes at Sweeten, we saw in-progress photos of those show-stopping black fixtures when the Sweeten contractor checked in with updates throughout the project (with Queens cheesecake hand-delivered on a visit to our offices!). What a complete treat for us to be able to show off all of this beautiful finished work!</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work, business school, and an appetite for adventure had Joel and Eric relocating from NYC to overseas and back again. With New York soil permanently underfoot, the couple set their sights on a spacious one-bedroom co-op with loads of potential in the heart of Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights area. Ready to undo a decade-old renovation of glitter paint and overly dark finishes, this couple teamed up with a Sweeten general contractor and his past Sweeten clients, designers <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casey and Kumar</a>, to get it done.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Joel, Prospect Heights homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009, work opportunities and the promise of adventure led my partner, Eric, and I to leave NYC. We lived abroad, I went to business school, and we even found ourselves settling in Downtown Detroit for a while. But in early 2015, moving prompted us yet again; this time unexpectedly back to where our journey began.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, it was smart that we kept the small studio apartment that Eric owned when we left. It made the logistics of moving back to the city easy to stomach. To save money, we set a goal of living in the studio for as long as possible. “How bad could it be?” we thought: the studio is in an awesome location with great subway access, and is surrounded by dog-friendly parks. This was wishful thinking. 400 square feet turned out to be far too small for two men and a precocious American Eskimo Dog named Comet.</span></p>
<h3>Finding a new home in Prospect Heights</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We embarked on a hunt for more spacious digs with some basic criteria: a well-proportioned, reasonably priced (by NYC standards), pet-friendly 1BR/1BA apartment with dog-friendly parks nearby. After a four-month search, we finally closed on a large, corner apartment in a welcoming co-op. We had spent summer and fall weekends attending open houses from Hamilton Heights to Jackson Heights to Brooklyn Heights – only to end up in the building right next door to where we were already living – in Prospect Heights. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features in the new apartment that struck us during our first open house visit: plentiful sunlight streaming in from multiple large windows on three sides, ample storage space, an in-unit washer and dryer, and rooms with generous proportions. The apartment is located in a 1920’s-era co-op building on a stretch of Eastern Parkway where many units contain sunken living rooms, high ceilings, and elaborate ornamental details. But sometime in the early 2000s, our apartment suffered a poorly executed renovation that installed heavy, dark cabinetry throughout, dark flooring and dark paint colors. One of the strangest choices: kitchen walls painted metallic silver in which actual glitter had been included. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from these superficial issues, there were also some fundamental flaws in the floor plan that we wanted to change. An awkward entry foyer &#8211; too small to fit a full-size dining table but too large to be a hallway &#8211; adjoined an enclosed, undersized kitchen. Similarly, a short, dark hallway led to a cramped bathroom that lacked sufficient storage and counter space. The bathroom always smelled damp and musty because the floor and walls were finished with absorbent limestone tiles.</span></p>
<h3>Finding the right experts for the job</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the weekends we spent open-house hopping, Eric and I met a woman selling her charmingly renovated Crown Heights apartment who raved about Sweeten. Months later, after closing, we recalled this conversation and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the vision for our renovation on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We eventually connected with our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a></strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eric and I were impressed by the portfolio of work that Kris had executed for other clients, especially his focus on simple finishes and quality craftsmanship. Eric and I contacted references; one of the references was a designer named Kumar. He and his wife Casey, also a designer, had just moved into their apartment and had <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated with Sweeten and the same contractor</a>. Kumar invited us to visit. When Eric and I arrived at Casey and Kumar’s apartment, we were stunned by their beautiful, comfortable, modernist apartment renovation that was full of thoughtful construction details.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Eric and I fancy ourselves as design-minded, we didn’t have the ability to design or manage a renovation that would approach Casey and Kumar’s beautiful home. Kumar must have intuited this because he suggested that we could hire Casey, who was already planning to launch a freelance design career, to serve as our project designer and manager. We loved this proposal and signed up as their inaugural client. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The design process was holistic and thorough. They started our first meetings asking us how we lived our lives at home, the kinds of physical objects and furniture we have (or would like to have), and how we wanted to use the new space. Knowing that Eric and I wanted a calm and minimalist aesthetic with some warmth, Casey composed a palette of colors in shades of white, grey and blue and materials consisting of stones and wood grain to employ throughout the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the kitchen, Kumar strongly advised that since we had a well-proportioned apartment, converting the kitchen to an open concept with the living room wasn’t desirable. With our contractor&#8217;s help, we discovered that multiple gas and water pipes in the wall between the kitchen and living room made this idea impractical. He determined it was feasible to enlarge the kitchen by removing the wall separating it from the foyer. With a larger kitchen, we gained an opportunity to extend the countertop and increase the workspace.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to somehow create a relationship between the kitchen and living room, Casey came up with the brilliant idea of installing a unified countertop, designed as a monumental piece of furniture, that wraps around the wall between the two rooms with plenty of integrated storage underneath. On the kitchen side, this counter would serve as the kitchen prep workspace. On the living room side, the countertop could function as a buffet surface adjacent to where we planned to place a dining table. At the peninsula end where the two sides meet, a beautiful waterfall edge would function as a service and conversational area for drinks or appetizers during dinner parties.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the countertop material, Eric and I wanted marble but decided against it due to cost, softness, and tendency to absorb stains. Our contractor recommended we use durable Caesarstone and we went with the “Raw Concrete” finish. Working with his carpenter, Casey and Kumar designed custom white oak kitchen cabinets to mirror the new lighter wood flooring that replaced the black mosaic floor tiles. We stripped the existing floors elsewhere in the apartment and refinished them with a much lighter stain to match the new kitchen floor. The two items we kept from the original kitchen were the Bosch stove and dishwasher left by the previous owners. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completely gutted the bathroom and indeed enlarged it by incorporating part of the adjacent hallway. The washer/dryer closet door used to open into this narrow hallway that would now be part of the bathroom. We reversed the orientation of the washer/dryer closet so it opened instead to the more spacious bedroom. Casey designed a glass enclosed shower stall to replace the tub. The floating Duravit Scola sink and streamlined Toto toilet were chosen for their minimal footprints, helping to increase the sense of openness in the small space. We utilized a minimalist material palette for the bathroom: honed slate tile floors and white subway tiles for the walls, with a floating white oak shelf above the sink for a touch of warmth. The Toto toilet washlet was an indulgence we wanted to include from our experience abroad.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen and the bathroom were the biggest design and construction interventions in our project. But throughout the apartment, our designers were adamant that we address numerous small and simple details that Eric and I never would have thought of on our own. A few examples: In the entry hallway there was already a large coat closet. Casey and Kumar convinced us to create a new pantry out of some of the former foyer space. Not only did we get additional food storage, but the outer wall of the new pantry now lined up with the refrigerator wall of the kitchen, helping to reinforce the visual identity of our newly enlarged kitchen space. At the entry to the sunken living room, the team recommended removing the wrought iron rails and squaring off the formerly rounded stair landing. And inside the shortened hall between the bedroom and bathroom that used to be a shadow cove, the decorative arch was removed and the ceiling lowered to be flush with the lower ceiling level of the adjacent sunken living room. These and other small changes clarified what used to be many intersecting and conflicting lines and helped the overall design feel cohesive. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design scheme for our apartment was far more thoughtful and sophisticated than Eric and I expected. But the quality of the end result would not have been possible without the customer commitment and attention to quality from our contractor. From the very beginning, we felt confident that we were putting our investment in safe and competent hands. In any construction project, you expect a certain amount of unforeseen problems and ours was no exception. One significant example towards the end of the project: the stone subcontractor installed the three massive pieces of the Caesarstone countertop. After the installation cured, it looked beautiful, but the pieces were not sized perfectly. To an untrained eye, the difference wasn’t immediately noticeable, but Casey noticed the problem and brought it to our attention. Our Sweeten contractor immediately took ownership of the error. A week or so later, the stone fabricators returned and put in new pieces. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn’t be happier with the end result of our apartment renovation. It’s an amazing feeling to come off the busy streets of New York City and enter our new home that is beautiful, serene, and supremely comfortable, and have space to entertain or host guests. We got to this result through the work of a couple of talented young designers and a builder we were incredibly happy to work with. Sweeten made this all possible. A happy customer told us about Sweeten. Sweeten helped us find an excellent contractor. And through good word-of-mouth from the contractor’s previous client, we unexpectedly also ended up hiring that client as our project designer and manager. As very satisfied customers, Eric and I are happy to continue that virtuous cycle.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years of renting their Brooklyn one-bedroom from a fellow resident, Molly Bloom and Jonathan Schultz got a rare renters’ opportunity: they bought the apartment straight from their landlord! They loved the building’s close community of neighbors and were excited to be new parents in a co-op full of young families. There was no debate about which project they’d tackle first: the bathroom was ringed with original orange creamsicle tiles and filled with creaky old fixtures. Read on for Molly’s take on their modern Ditmas Park bathroom renovation.</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/molly-bathroom-renovation-ditmas-park/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16908" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/molly-bathroom.jpg" alt="simple bathroom remodel" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/molly-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/molly-bathroom-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Molly Bloom, Ditmas Park homeowner</span></i><span id="more-16933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We moved into this apartment in 2008, just after coming home from ten months in South America. It was a rental in a co-op in Ditmas Park and full of young families—there are about 40 children in the building, with two born in the past couple of weeks and two due by the end of the month! Our unit is a one-bedroom and we bought it it from our landlords, who live in the building in another unit they own. I left freelance copyediting to be home with our new baby and Jonathan is a contributing editor at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time Inc.&#8217;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TheDrive.com. (No, we do not own a car&#8230; Jonathan commutes by bicycle when he has an office job.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bathroom was heinous: sunburn-colored tiles striped with speckled grayish-white ones, original to the 1960s construction. Everyone in the building gets rid of that tile as soon as they can. There was a riser pipe in the corner that got hot and carried noise from our neighbors&#8217; apartments above and below. The flush-o-meter toilet was a pain to keep clean, and it was incredibly loud. There were other original fixtures, too, such as the magazine rack and the laundry hamper, which we used to store toilet paper. And the replacement sink cabinet was strangely low, perhaps designed for oompa-loompas. We wanted a crisp space with easy-to-clean fixtures—that&#8217;s all. We decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post our project to Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and were soon introduced to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Gennadiy</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ready to help us re-build the bathroom with charm. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16907" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Molly_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Molly_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Molly_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Molly_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completely gutted the original finishes and started fresh with a black, hex tile floor. It attracts a little dust but still looks sexy. We went with simple ceramic subway tile to line the shower and partial sink walls, but in a slimmer 2” by 8” modern format to mix it up a little. We chose a utilitarian wall-mounted porcelain sink with exposed piping, and Gennadiy put the sink a touch higher so we wouldn&#8217;t have to stoop while brushing our teeth. He also recommended a smooth Corian windowsill, which is easy to clean. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gennadiy boxed out the vertical heating pipe and installed a sleek grille to give us some soundproofing and a little distance from the heat, and we chose a Toto toilet on Gennadiy&#8217;s recommendation, one with flat sides to make cleaning easy. We also added a pull-out drying rack because when you have a baby, you need to wash everything all the time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m really glad we got the work done before our son arrived, though ideally any renovations would happen before someone moves into an apartment. I found out I was pregnant after work had already started, and there were a few cold winter days where it was extra tough to be crashing with family and sneezing in single-digit temperatures. I remember thinking, “This renovation can&#8217;t be done soon enough!” And thanks to Gennadiy and his team’s quick work, it was!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When a design editor and curator came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate the kitchen and bathroom in her 1910 Greenwich Village industrial loft, we were psyched to see what she would do with the remnants of a 1970s condo conversion and eager to see how a design professional would (presumably) breeze through her own renovation. We most definitely did end up with a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom after we introduced this homeowner to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Aleks</a>, but we also landed some especially insightful lessons learned along the way. We&#8217;ll keep our source secret because she works in the industry, but here are three renovation lessons from a sweetened kitchen and bathroom that everyone should know.</p>
<p><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/3-renovation-lessons-learned-from-a-greenwich-village-designer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14579" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg" alt="kitchen and bath renovation " width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14565"></span></p>
<h3>1. Visit the showrooms, but buy online.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The insider tip from this renovation is that you have to combine high-tech and low-tech research methods to make decisions and purchases. Products are endlessly available from a huge variety of sources and it&#8217;s worth visiting showrooms and stone yards to see and touch the materials that will be in your home for years, but the best prices for most materials can be found online. Even with architect and designer discounts, this design pro found that most purchases were cheaper online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One potential downside of skipping the brick and mortar ordering experience is that you are dealing with a wide variety of sources across many appliances and fixtures. The word from our insider is to apply some good old-fashioned patience and diligence in dealing with different customer service contacts, but also take very clear pictures of labels and serial numbers and specs in case you need to correct an order or source any additional tiny parts. Keep your cool as materials arrive by cataloguing electronic records and photos of all of the pieces, with serial numbers visible in your photos, so that you can instantly source what you need as deliveries fall into place. These records will also help you document any problems you do run into with vendors and will give you a much clearer path to resolving issues big and small.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Learn your way around IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our industry source looked at lots of kitchen cabinetry options and found that the high-end route was astronomically expense. Frustratingly, the next tier down was slightly more budget-friendly, but not enough to mask the difference in construction quality. IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system required admittedly time-consuming weeknight trips and weekend excursions, but investing time and learning her way around their design software yielded a great set of cabinets and a modern look at a much lower price point. &#8220;Brace yourself and crack IKEA&#8221; in her words!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with any order, you should have your contractor confirm measurements and weigh in on the pieces you pick before you order. Your contractor is your full partner in the renovation &#8211; even if you have the patience to teach yourself to use IKEA&#8217;s design system, your contractor will figure out ways to make things work and help you pass obstacles you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see coming.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Stay close by and check in often.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re going with a major renovation and need to stay elsewhere while the work is underway, it&#8217;s really important to be close by and check in often. Even with all of the advance planning and ordering and designing that goes in to the process, there are decisions being made on the ground at every stage and you want to be a part of it. It&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re supervising the work or preventing mistakes, it&#8217;s that there are small decisions and many paths that the team will go down, and you can have an impact as design translates into build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talk to your contractor about when visits make sense and be a regular thought partner in the progress. Our insider also encouraged renovators to be kind to themselves and to their contractors: be prepared for mistakes &#8211; the wrong color, the wrong size, and unforeseen adjustments are an inevitable part of a complex and custom process. Forgive yourself and build in the emotional and scheduling contingencies to address mistakes and keep moving forward.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this renovation, our expert insider was aiming for contemporary, sleek, and decidedly unfussy. She credited Sweeten Expert Aleks and his team in bringing calm to the storm, suggesting realistic upgrades and solutions for custom adjustments and tight corners, and for being a welcome partner in day to day problem-solving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we ventured just a ways up the street from Sweeten&#8217;s NYC headquarters to the East Village for a tour of a gut-renovated one bed, one bath co-op. This place was &#8212; to use the technical term &#8212; a disaster. As the apartment&#8217;s new owner, Henry, was clear to note in his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a>, the kitchen was destroyed, the bathroom was destroyed, the living room was destroyed&#8230;the whole place needed modern re-design and upgrades that would improve flow and use of space. Henry couldn&#8217;t move in until work was done, so we introduced him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> to manage some serious demolition and rebuilding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-henrys-east-village-condo-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14126 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover" width="600" height="410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14111"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry works for an investment bank in New York City and took an appraising look at the kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom of his new purchase. It wasn&#8217;t just that the unit had considerable damage in each room, Henry also saw the potential for better use of space and ways to connect the rooms to one another. He planned to remove a dividing wall between the kitchen and living room and re-orient the kitchen so that it would open toward the rest of the apartment and let more light in. Henry also found himself puzzled by decisions the previous owner made in the bathroom. Half of the bath had been lined with faux wood paneling and the other half was inexplicably blocked off by the tub&#8217;s entire length. The East Village certainly has plenty of old tenement-building bathrooms, but this was on another level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14127" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed.png" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team played a big role in suggesting solutions, finalizing layout plans, and selecting materials for this full overhaul. The kitchen wall came down to reveal a generous open living area, and the team installed brand new pre-finished 5&#8243; wide plank wood flooring (from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Solid-Hardwood/Plank/N-5yc1vZbejwZ1z0wtnu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>) to unite the entire apartment. Henry went with his experts&#8217; consensus that white shaker cabinetry would modernize and brighten the kitchen, and added a masculine, contemporary touch with a mixed material backsplash that incorporates dark and light steel and glass elements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the team ripped out the old tub and put in Italian ceramic floor tiles that mimic a light wood grain finish. Henry decided on a simple and modern half wall and full shower tile and created a beautiful accent wall with rippled gray tile that suggests flowing water. The shower floor is now anchored with a blue-gray small cube tile. The team added a frameless glass shower door with chrome finishes and installed a modern, wall-mounted sink vanity that Henry likes for its clean lines and hotel spa look.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry&#8217;s expert team did a lot of cosmetic work to return the living areas and bedroom to full working order. Henry chose a <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/color-collections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutral Benjamin Moore gray</a> and loves the tall, streamlined baseboard molding that the contractor suggested using. New closet doors with 93&#8243; height doors were added to the bedroom and the apartment&#8217;s east-facing windows are now stylishly dressed in warm wood blinds, another standard <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Decor-Blinds-Window-Treatments/N-5yc1vZar4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a> find.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/bathrooms/elinor-and-joels-park-slope-bathroom-renovation-homeowner-guest-post"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Guest post by Elinor in Park Slope</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-13906"></span>We bought our Park Slope co-op six years ago knowing that the bathroom would have to be renovated but hoping that we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it for several years. The delay was partly about recovering from the process of buying our first place &#8211; which was pretty stressful &#8211; but it probably had more to do with being complete novices when it came to finding, hiring, and working with a contractor. We worried about making mistakes that could both cost us a bundle and do a lot of damage to our home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a 1920s building with a lot of original features, the bathroom still had a beautiful original tub and all of it&#8217;s pre-war tile. The plumbing, however, was also a 1920s original and some bad patches made over the years to the tile and fixtures were starting to fall apart. The medicine cabinet was rusty and so thickly painted that the door no longer closed. Towel rails fell off the wall. The shower started sending more water out of the tap than the shower head. And finally, the old regulator flush toilet sprung a leak that threatened a serious flood. Action was needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13915" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg" alt="before-1" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;d read about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in an article in the New York Times and, almost on a whim, posted our project. I was surprised by how quickly they got in touch. We were introduced to Sweeten Expert Niki who had also been mentioned in the Times article and whose name I had run across doing independent research. Working with Sweeten gave us that extra confidence to move ahead knowing we had a team that had been screened, but we also liked being able to call up Sweeten to ask questions about practical things like what to expect from the estimate process and how payment schedules are generally set up. Niki&#8217;s team was a great fit because they brought design and build expertise &#8211; we just didn&#8217;t have the time (or patience) to run all over town looking at tile samples and taps and we needed someone to help narrow down all the choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My ideal was to somehow bring the bathroom back to its shiny, original look by restoring the tile rather than starting from scratch and replacing it all. But it quickly became clear that to sort out the plumbing and move the shower head, the wall tile would have to come down and objectively, it really was too far gone to save. With that decision made, we chose materials that were as close to the originals as possible, which meant polished chrome fixtures from <a href="https://www.barclayproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barclay</a> (the tub filler and hand-shower), and a thermostatic control, shower head, and sink tap all from <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>. We found a shiny metal medicine cabinet from <a href="https://rh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a> and continued the original tile surround with classic subway tile in a soft cream finish (&#8220;bone gloss&#8221;) rather than the more modern pure white. We couldn&#8217;t quite replicate the original black and white frieze near the top, so we chose a plain black tile as a contrast trim instead &#8212; all from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemo Tile</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13919" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01" width="600" height="406" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13926 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg" alt="benjamin moore teal" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original tub stayed and was reglazed; Niki and team also managed to save the original black and white floor tile. They built a new vanity with a Carrera marble top and glass pulls found on <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation</a>, which provides a lot of storage in a small space. They also added a modern light switch and gfi outlet so that I could finally use a hairdryer without crouching by an outlet in the bedroom. Accessories from <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/shop/bath/?cm_type=gnav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pottery Barn</a>, including the towel rail, glass shelf, and wall-mount light fixture fit right in with our mix of old and new. The new <a href="https://www.totousa.com/products/toilets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toto toilet</a> is light years beyond the its predecessor&#8230;no explosions or leak floods in our future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bit that no amount of research can prepare you for is how frazzled you will become: no matter how hard you try, your sense of humor will fail and you will be THAT client at some point in the process. And working with even the nicest of co-op boards will take a minimum of three months when plumbing is involved. It&#8217;s just hard to be realistic about those things up front. Niki managed the setbacks gracefully and the team worked really well with our building`s team, which is a huge help in keeping relationships friendly with your super and the neighbors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that it&#8217;s done, we love our new space and every morning I can enjoy taking a shower in the new thermostatically-controlled rainwater shower. The paint color (<a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Nearly Teal&#8221;</a>) never fails to cheer me up. It really is a shinier, happier version of its original self, minus the exploding toilet&#8230;!</p>
