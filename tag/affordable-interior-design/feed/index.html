										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I was helping <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Peter</a> with his new home office,  there were tons of issues that came up that needed to be addressed, and Peter took to saying &#8220;let&#8217;s ask my architect what to do.&#8221;  That phrase, &#8220;my architect&#8221; is one of those statements that implies so much, without really saying it. Like &#8220;my country home,&#8221; &#8220;my nanny,&#8221; and &#8220;my interior designer&#8221;&#8211; only the rarified few dare even think of having such things.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I love these fabulous resources that offer design help for the rest of us. And at Swee10 when you post your project you get estimates from many fantastic interior designers at once!<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #ff0000; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br />
