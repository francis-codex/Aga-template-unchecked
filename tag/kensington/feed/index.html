<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</strong></b>: Revamp an outdated kitchen in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Racquel scored a deal when she found her 800-square-foot co-op in an estate sale, though she knew the kitchen (that hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s) would need work. “The first thing I did when I put my offer in was ask people how to get the kitchen done. It looked like it belonged in a museum. I kept staring at the stove—I could not believe it,” she said. Her renovation journey, however, got off to a rocky start. After a year of work with a kitchen designer she found through an ad on Facebook, walkthroughs without results, a quick purchase of a too-big fridge, and poor communication overall, Racquel had enough and took a year off from the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once she felt ready to take it on again, a friend, who was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating her house</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> and had joined <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/referral/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their referral program</a>, suggested Racquel give them a try. “My friend said, ‘I’ve already started with Sweeten and they’re great.’ I was done trying to find people on my own that I couldn&#8217;t properly vet. I needed people who knew the business,” Racquel explained. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project </a>with the goal of bringing the old-fashioned space to the 21st century while maintaining a feeling of playfulness and joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377">this general contractor</a>, work began. Some debate about the stove ensued, but ultimately she decided to replace it. After living with it for over two years, “I had a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with my stove,” she said. While her initial thought was to incorporate quirky touches in the main elements of the kitchen, like using butcher block for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, she decided to stick with modern, easy-to-clean materials, and incorporate more of her personality through accessories and paint. The white glossy cabinets with simple matte black hardware achieved that sleek look while offering a neutral backdrop for a creamy yellow wall and colorful knick-knacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The elevator broke down, which caused some minor hiccups. The stove, which was set to be delivered, had to be delayed and was then lost. Despite the holdup, Racquel’s renovation was completed within the three-week time period the general contractor had quoted from the beginning. “He worked around the issues without batting an eyelash,” she said. He even joined her on a trip to IKEA, waited for the cabinets, and brought them to her home the next morning. “He told me every day what was going to happen that day, and that’s exactly what happened,” she continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36155 mb-24 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-and-herringbone-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black handles and off-white countertop and yellow walls and herringbone backsplash and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-and-yellow-walls"  class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-36151" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with white countertop and yellow wall and undermount stainless steel sink with brushed nickel pull down faucet and herringbone backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovator</a>, Racquel shared this advice: “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. Her patience certainly paid off. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The cabinets were still a little difficult for Racquel to reach, so the contractor also left a space for her ladder between the fridge and the wall, so she’d have easy access to it when she needed to reach higher shelves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>For two Brooklyn grandparents with aging-in-place plans, a layout change turns their co-op into an oasis</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35016 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout, Brooklyn grandparents renovate" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marie and John are both NYC natives who had lived in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. for many years. When their first grandchild was born in Brooklyn in 2014, they began plotting the move back to their hometown. After John retired in 2017, the couple decided to buy a home that would accommodate large gatherings with their friends, five children, and the growing number of grandkids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35478 size-chrono" title="Marie and John" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-22-723x482.jpg" alt="Marie and John, Brooklyn grandparents, home renovation, home, design construction" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35017 size-chrono" title="floor plan " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35019 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a four-month search with unsuccessful bids on two other properties, Marie and John visited an open house in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. “Even though it was a very wet, snowy day in early 2017, there were many potential buyers,” Marie said. &#8220;We both liked the size and layout and could see great potential in the space. There were 12 large windows with three exposures, which won us over. We ended up paying over asking price, but were satisfied with the deal.” The 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op boasted about 1,300 square feet of living space and was close to Prospect Park as well as their children. The closing occurred in May; the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a Sweeten architect</a> to help with a thorough renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35024 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-01-723x933.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, renovation, open layout" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35021 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although serviceable, the apartment needed some TLC in terms of remodeling the kitchen, bathroom, and converting an existing half-bath into a master bath with a shower. They also wanted to open up the space so that the three exposures could bring light into every corner of the apartment. The conversation with their Sweeten architect resulted in architectural renderings, which planned the space as an &#8220;age-in-place oasis&#8221; for the active couple who wanted the convenience and amenities of city living while also being able to host a large extended family.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-05.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35023 size-chrono" title="french doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-05.gif" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, french doors, sliding doors, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35022 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To accommodate the couple’s desire to age in place and ultimately remain in the apartment as long as possible, their architect added accessible design features in the bathrooms. Materials and design were also implemented for easy maintenance, such as closets to keep spaces clutter-free, large-scale bath ceramic tile that required less grout, and moisture- and heat-resistant Caesarstone kitchen countertops.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the common spaces, a reconfigured layout maximized the open space for entertaining and cooking. A windowed den was previously accessible through the kitchen, but a reorientation connected it to the living room, which made more sense. The den could double as a guest room when necessary but would serve as a corner office on a daily basis. The pocket doors, which created an opening of six feet, could be left open so that more natural light entered the living room.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35030 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-16-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen, which previously had a tile floor, was re-laid with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a> to match that in the living room. The new continuous flooring helped unify the now open-plan living area. “Our new kitchen was outfitted with gray IKEA Bodbyn cabinets and glossy deep crimson glass tiles for the backsplash. It’s the extra special spark to our gray kitchen,” Marie said. The tall upper cabinets take advantage of the high ceiling and provide extra storage space. &#8220;Based on our own past experience, we chose quartz countertops,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The fact that it is practically indestructible met our desire for a low-maintenance lifestyle.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The demolition of a wall between the kitchen and the dining alcove transformed the previously dark space into a brightly lit and well-integrated dining area. Their Sweeten architect also replaced the existing closets at the back of the dining space with additional cabinetry that matched the kitchen. Upper cabinets were faced with glass and a mirrored backsplash which the homeowners loved. A spherical chandelier in bronze was hung above the dining table as a statement piece.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35035 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, before" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35033 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-723x1085.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next major transformation was in the master bath, which was originally a powder room (they planned to borrowed square footage from a second bedroom). The tiny space had no room for a shower, which the homeowners wanted, so the architect embarked on an arduous process of convincing the co-op board that increasing the footprint of the bathroom, which involved creating wet-over-dry conditions (something that’s usually a no-no for co-ops), would not be a problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35032 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-20-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom, renovation, shower, toilet, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to allay the concerns of the board, the architect met with the board and building engineer to go over all of the precautions that would be taken as well as the materials that were chosen and installation methods. The result of their architect&#8217;s perseverance: excellent water- and sound-proofing so that neighboring apartments would not be affected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They chose light-colored <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile for the floors</a> and walls, with accent tiles for the shower floor and niche. The design included a long safety bar inside the shower for more stability when showering—one of the features that would accommodate Marie and John as they age. A large square sink from Duravit sits on a stand with modern lines and one shelf below.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35034 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, before, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35036 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, floating vanity, bathtub, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The guest bath featured a large mirror with a stone shelf beneath and lighter colors. Safety handlebars were also added to the inside of the bathtub wall. For easy cleaning and to free up the floor space, wall-hung sinks were installed. “This bathroom has no window, but looks bright, large, and attractive,” Marie said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-18-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35343 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-18-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, shower head, shower, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation was a true collaboration between the homeowners and the architect. Marie explained, “Our Sweeten architect was extremely helpful, making suggestions, listening to our opinions and helping us decide. She seemed to be totally invested while following our tastes and budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do they feel about their new home? “Our new space feels comfortable and cozy,&#8221; Marie said. &#8220;The natural light combined with our light fixtures make it a happy place to live. We feel very much at home&#8230;like we have been here for a long time.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Marie and John. We hope you’ll have many happy family gatherings in your new home!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re in Ditmas Park this week for an extra fun assignment! Usually, we chronicle all of the shiny new things in a New York City renovation. This week, the challenge is to figure out what stayed put in a family&#8217;s kitchen and closet upgrade. One quick look at the before and afters here might leave you thinking that this was a classic gut renovation, but a closer study reveals a more surgical project with a lot of smart design compromises that let a Ditmas Park family keep what was working and fit in a lot of extra storage and style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/before-after-kensington-kitchen-and-closets-sweetened"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14932 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png" alt="closet renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14921"></span>Nikkia and Daniel moved into their 850 square foot two-bedroom apartment feeling grateful that the previous owners had taken care of restoring hardwood floors and putting a coat of fresh paint throughout the place. The kitchen had new cabinets and appliances, but the dark finish and heavy trim obscured the room&#8217;s natural light and the layout made key storage space inaccessible and inefficiently used. The kitchen lacked a backsplash in its high traffic stove and sink area and the previous owners had skipped on cabinetry in the windowed corner, opting for slim open storage instead. In the bedroom, two narrow adjacent closets were no match for two sets of clothes and shoes, ceding precious storage space to an unnecessary dividing wall. The family&#8217;s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten project post</a> called for giving the kitchen a more modern, light and open feel without making major architectural or construction changes and combining the two small bedroom closets into one large closet with smarter organization options. We thought <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> would be a great fit for the clever work that would be needed to make both spots work harder for this family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14934" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14933" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14938" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sweeten contractor and his team started in the kitchen with a few targeted plans: they removed the traditional molding that added heft to the upper line of cabinets, gave the cabinets a new coat of <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/oc-117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore &#8220;Simply White&#8221; paint</a> inside and out, and swapped in more modern and sturdy hardware to complement the Shaker-style cabinet lines. They also added classic white subway tiles from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a> to wrap around the stove and sink prep space, protecting the newly white walls from cooking collateral and replaced the original sink with a sleeker, deeper, and more durable under-mount. The team replaced laminate counters in two spots with a new contemporary gray quartz and installed a more flexible Grohe single-handle sink faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most significant upgrade is also in some ways the most unassuming: out with the limited shelving and storage cart that never quite fit in the corner by the window, and in went expertly matched new cabinetry and counters to mimic the materials now in place on the other two sides of the kitchen. Deep <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a> drawer storage puts cookware within a few feet of the stove and a translucent upper cabinet displays glass and barware. The new section of countertop doubles as a mini eat-in kitchen nook with its extra overhang. Appliances and original cabinetry and floor tiles all stayed put, saving thousands of dollars and keeping the project on a much tighter timeline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, the contractor took on two tiny closets with side-by-side doors and a single row of hanging rod space, freeing up un-used space in between and adding simple improvements to every inch. Double hanging rods, open shelving, drawer storage, bright all-white materials, and interior lighting now house a wide range of wardrobe necessities with dedicated spaces for bags, shoes, a hamper, and folded clothes. The contractor re-did the door molding and hardware to make the addition look seamless and matched a new set of extra-tall 96&#8243; swing doors, minus the builder-grade insets from the previous set, for a more modern look.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Last month, we shared the first-hand renovation</span> <a href="/2013/07/25/homeowner-guest-post-lisas-kitchen-renovation-pt-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story of Lisa Law</a><span style="color: #000000;">, a Brooklyn Heights homeowner who used theSweeten to update her crumbling kitchen, and today, we&#8217;re excited to share our 2nd homeowner guest post &#8212; coincidentally, this story also comes from a Brooklyn homeowner named Lisa who used theSweeten to renovate her kitchen! Lisa B., who works in the architecture &amp; interiors industry, and her husband Brian, a media studies professor &amp; author, had lived in their Kensington apartment for 8 years before taking the leap to renovate their kitchen. The couple</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted to Sweeten</a><span style="color: #000000;"> were matched with a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Today we have before &amp; afters of the transformed kitchen, along with Lisa&#8217;s insightful narrative on the new design and the process of making it happen.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9736 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="256" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before renovating, our kitchen had its original, 1960s pine cabinets that were custom-built for the space, but had many layers of bad paint jobs and several of the doors didn&#8217;t close. We thought about trying to save them, but they were so solidly built that there was no way to cut them down to fit our new design plan. Plus, stripping all that paint off would have been a nightmare. The vinyl flooring was peeling, the wall oven didn&#8217;t work, the cooktop was barely functional and it was almost impossible to see what you were cooking since it was stuck in a corner under a metal hood. The countertops were horrible, fake woodgrain formica. When we first moved in, they were even worse &#8212; there was contact paper on them, which we were able to pull up, but we were disappointed with what we uncovered!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed a gut renovation! Everything had to go, down to the studs, which meant new drywall, ceilings, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, flooring, backsplash and lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9662 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I read about Sweeten a while ago in NYMag and kept it in the back of my mind because I knew we were going to renovate our kitchen. Although I worked in the interior design field, most of the contractors I knew were doing high-end renovations in Manhattan. I posted before pictures of my kitchen on the site and Sweeten introduced me via email to three contractors, all of whom I met with and who gave me estimates. They all seemed good, but as someone who knows about renovation, I appreciated that our contractor took extra time to really look at the kitchen, open up the cabinets, anticipate potential problems, and talk in depth about the process.<span id="more-9660"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9663 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="904" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-199x300.png 199w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-597x900.png 597w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Design / Style</strong></span></em>: Having worked as a design assistant for an architectural interior design firm, I got to see a lot of custom kitchens being made, usually with white millwork and cabinetry, which I really like &#8211; it&#8217;s clean and timeless.  I learned about a lot of interesting materials and fixtures, too, and my style leans towards a mix of mid-century modern and contemporary &#8212; definitely not ultra-modern.  Even though the building was built in 1961, the apartment has some nice, almost mid-century modern, details: a curved hallway soffit, hardwood floors, baseboard moldings, and a really neat custom pantry closet with separate compartments.  I wanted the kitchen to fit the era of the apartment and the building, but still be updated. I knew that I wanted high gloss, white cabinets and appliances in order to create a feeling of space, plus they are so much easier to clean.  The kitchen is small, so having simple lines and using materials in a way that make the space feel bigger were key factors in the design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m not afraid of dark or saturated colors, but you have to know how to use them. Using the dark navy color on the back wall was yet another way to create the illusion of space by making that wall disappear, or recede, into the background.  You also need to consider the light in the space when choosing a wall color, and sometimes the right color can be almost counter-intuitive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9664 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9665 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s always difficult to do a gut renovation in an apartment. Living in a construction zone is messy and stressful, although Nick&#8217;s team did their best to keep the dust and debris to a minimum.  Of course, budget was a challenge. You have to think about what to spend your money on to get the most bang for your buck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Flooring</strong></span></em>: I was so tempted to spend a lot on the flooring, but in a small space, it&#8217;s often not really worth it.  I decided on porcelain tile because of price point and durability, but finding one was tricky; there weren&#8217;t a lot of color options that would compliment my countertops, which I had already picked out. I finally found an Italian porcelain, which wasn&#8217;t expensive; I used a big 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; tile in a staggered brick pattern laid horizontally to give the illusion of width.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Cabinets</strong></span></em>: I knew that I wanted to buy the cabinets from Ikea, which is a great, budget-friendly, option. They are really well-made &#8212; much better than cabinets from the big box stores and even sometimes better than the ones you can get from custom cabinet dealers. Planning a kitchen from scratch is a challenge, and if you are buying cabinets from Ikea, you really need to have a good idea of what you want before you order, especially since the cabinets only come in a limited range of sizes. The designers there are helpful, but only up to a certain point. I had to think a lot about the functionality of the space, the flow, and the most efficient way to store everything. It helps to have a contractor who has installed Ikea cabinets before, and Nick knew what to expect. Nick was also great at coming up with custom solutions &#8212; when the new cabinets didn&#8217;t fit exactly how we wanted them, he created a modified, open cabinet so that we would still get the added storage. He also built a very sleek, custom radiator cover which can be easily removed to get to the radiator, if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span></em>: Because it&#8217;s a small kitchen, I also needed to think about things like appliance door clearance &#8212; we wanted an integrated dishwasher next to the sink, and had to figure out where was best to install it in order to keep from disrupting the flow in the kitchen. Even figuring out which way the cabinet doors would open was important to plan out ahead of time.  Finding a counter-depth, 32&#8243; wide refrigerator in a smooth white finish was also a challenge. Europeans have the leg up on American manufacturers when it comes to smaller, apartment size appliances.</p>
