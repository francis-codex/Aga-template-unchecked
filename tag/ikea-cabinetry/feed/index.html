										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>When Fabio and Melina won the bidding war on a two-bedroom Carnegie Hill apartment, they were amazed and delighted. With outdoor space, family-friendly amenities, and just one block from the new Second Avenue subway, it checked off all the right boxes. The only downside: it needed a thorough facelift and the clock was ticking on their rental apartment. Oh, and their baby was due any minute. Here’s how they juggled the ups and downs of renovating, while learning to be new parents—Melina gave birth to their son a month into the project!</i></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22047 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by Carnegie Hill homeowner Melina </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the lease of our functional but tiny, 550 square-foot, one-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side about to end and a baby boy on the way, the time came to try and buy a place. We set our hopes on a two-bedroom apartment in our neighborhood, ideally with great light and storage space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward three months into our search and there were still no prospects. We were starting to lose hope! We went to every open house around us and looked at all options. Many of the apartments we visited were too expensive, too small, too dark, or way too far from any subway or daycare, which was our desired childcare plan. That is, until we visited a listing two blocks south of our rental and a block from the entrance of the new Second Avenue subway–whose opening, at the time, still sounded like a dream far in the future. The apartment itself was falling apart and looked straight out of “That ‘70s Show.” Only one family had occupied the home since the building was built 40 years ago, and no renovations had ever been done. Most of its walls were painted green, the living room had an entire wall covered in mirrors, and a popcorn ceiling ran throughout. However, the space was promising. A true two-bedroom on a high floor, with a large balcony off the living room, light (windows in every room!), and closet space. It came with basement storage, a bike room, a children’s playroom in-the-making, and a roof deck. Our only reservation was the need for a full renovation before moving in. Despite that, we made an offer, thinking we wouldn’t win the bidding war anyway. To our surprise, our best and almost unreasonable offer did.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22036 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02-1-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02 (1)" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21972 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/floorplan-2-600x516.jpg" alt="floorplan (2)" width="600" height="516" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We found Sweeten on an online search and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6445">posted our project </a>to be matched with builders. We were nervous about finding a contractor who could understand our expectations and timing constraints. The lease on our rental was ending before the summer, and so our move-in date was not flexible. We had less than four months to complete our entire renovation project. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177">our Sweeten contractor</a> because we immediately felt we could trust him in getting the job done in time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21973 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21974 size-chrono" title="farmhouse sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-13" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21975 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus for our renovation was the kitchen and bathroom. Fabio and I both love to cook and wanted a space where we could work together at the same time. The small bathroom needed to feel less cluttered and gain storage space. Our contractor provided decisive support, validated our suggestions, and helped to define the details before starting the work. We wanted to make this apartment our own, and he was happy to accommodate our choices, but he also made sure they were practical. As soon as we closed on the apartment, the team went in and started the demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before construction, we spent a lot of time pulling together the look and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view on the style we were trying to achieve. Our material choices included Carrara marble, cement and ceramic tile, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and black and white cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We opened up the kitchen entryway slightly to let additional light come through to the dining area. We opted for countertops on opposite sides to maximize prep space and to accommodate a full semi-professional espresso setup—Fabio is a coffee geek. Our Sweeten contractor helped us finalize our design with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We spend a great deal of time in the kitchen and didn’t want strong colors we may grow tired of quickly, and settled on black cabinets with patterned ceramic floor tiles to add interest. While we tried to stay within our budget as much as possible, we splurged on professional heavy-duty appliances. We went with a modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased copper cabinet pulls online. The new kitchen is fantastic—the storage space feels especially luxurious compared to our previous kitchens.</p>

<p>We kept the bathroom’s tub and had it re-enameled but replaced the sink, cabinetry, hardware, and had the floor and walls retiled. We used a gold, black and white color theme that coordinated with the light fixtures and cement floor tiles. To create storage space, we built a new partially recessed medicine cabinet hidden behind the door. There was no heat in the bathroom, and with long New York winters in mind, we added a small towel heater.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The flooring throughout the apartment needed to be replaced, and our contractor took us to his supplier for a selection of inexpensive but great-looking wood flooring. We went with a light-colored wood with dark veins to generate an interesting contrast. The shelves in the rooms’ closets were falling apart. Initially, we planned on using IKEA shelving to replace them but because they weren’t standard size, we had them custom-designed by <a href="https://www.californiaclosets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Closets</a> to optimize our storage space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21986 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>Our son was born one month into the renovation, and we were able to trust our contractor and his colleagues to handle the work with limited supervision. As with most renovation projects, some of our plans fell through unexpectedly, but our contractor and his team made sure we stayed on track and resolved every issue quickly and efficiently. The renovation has been complete for almost a year, and we could not be happier with our new apartment. Thanks to our contractor and Sweeten, we got our dream home and moved in on schedule.</p>
<p>Thank you Melina and Fabio for sharing how a renovation can be completed with grace under time constraint. We hope you continue to enjoy your home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg and Kelly were right where they wanted to be. The couple had just closed on a sought-after two-bedroom in a very popular Brooklyn co-op. But there was a big nagging problem lurking in the &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; of their home: severely dated decor wrapped in really bad wiring. The new homeowners just couldn’t focus on a future in their new apartment when the kitchen was so obviously stuck in the dark. Read on down for Gregg’s take on their sleek new kitchen renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17774" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg" alt="gregg-kitchen" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Gregg, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17761"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For about one year, Kelly and I searched all over Brooklyn to not only find the perfect apartment, but also the perfect neighborhood. The more we saw, the more our search started to narrow to Clinton Hill and the Clinton Hill Co-ops in particular. Located on what I think is one of the most beautiful streets in Brooklyn, the Clinton Hill Co-op campus had everything we were looking for: a sensible layout, sturdy prewar structure, and great value for the money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We zero’d in on a two-bedroom unit that was in need of a lot of work. Many of the apartments in the Co-ops have been renovated before; this one never had and it was a mess. In fact, it was so untouched that even the light switches were still push button rather than actual switches. But, having seen numerous posts on Sweeten, we knew the potential of the space and had a vision for what it could be. The first and most important thing for us to get to was the kitchen and dining room area. We </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and found </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Mick</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help us with the project.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17773" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a few things we really wanted. First, we wanted something light and airy. Our old apartment only had two windows and both were in constant shadow, so we wanted something that really allowed the light to filter into the living space. We also wanted a place that we could host people in and have a couple of different gathering spots. And finally, I wanted a place that would be easy to cook in and easy for storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mick guided us through all that needed to be done, had suggestions along the way about how to make the space work even better, and let us know what to expect as things went on. We were lucky to have someone who was so honest and upfront as the apartment was in such bad shape. For instance, after knocking down some of the walls, we really got to see how bad some of the wiring was. Mick walked us through the options and took care of everything. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With walls down and new wiring installed, we were ready for the fun stuff. We wanted finishes that were clean and bright, again to allow the sunlight to come in and to make it feel fresh and open. We decided to go with modern white IKEA cabinets because of the solid quality and affordable pricing. Mick, as someone who normally creates custom cabinetry, was able to really help us design a plan that would make the cabinets not feel so cookie-cutter. For the countertops, we went with honed black granite because we wanted the look of a soapstone or black marble, but with a little more durability. The stone looks fantastic and is really a great contrast to the high-gloss cabinets. It was Mick who recommended we get a counter-depth fridge in order to keep things more open with clean lines. It turned out to be a great recommendation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put in new wood floors ourselves that I think bring some much needed warmth to the space. They are engineered floors and we really liked that they felt lived-in but not in a way that seemed artificial. We wanted something that was matte, had character, but would also be durable. This flooring ticked off all of those boxes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, we couldn’t be more thrilled with the results. The before and after photos really tell the tale. Mick was able to do a fantastic job&#8211;and on budget. Not only that, he has an attention to detail that is very hard to find in many NYC contractors. Most contractors are concerned with getting the job done and that is it &#8211; Mick is concerned with getting the job done and getting it done right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been several months since the renovation and we both still say “we can’t believe this is actually our apartment”.</p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Rima Rivera, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17096"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I purchased my one-bedroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops five years ago after a very extensive search. I loved the vibe there and thought the apartment had great bones &#8212; and moving from Manhattan, it was larger than any recent apartment I’d had. The place was in decent enough condition when I bought it, but I had every intention of modernizing it. Of course, I couldn’t do it right away because I was financially exhausted after the purchase. So for four years, I sat in my living room fantasizing about my dream apartment, trying to muster up the courage and the money I would need to embark on a major renovation. I was familiar with Sweeten after neighbors recommended the site and frequently used the blog for inspiration. When I was finally ready to pull the trigger, I knew who to call.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my renovation project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten linked me with Sweeten Expert Bobby</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bobby was a perfect find for someone like me (overwhelmed and a total novice at the whole renovation process!). I told Bobby that I wanted to modernize the kitchen and bathroom and lay down a new floor. I also told him I would love to open up the kitchen and extend it out into the dining area, but I feared that the irregular layout would not allow for it and that I would be limited to working within the constraints of the small space. Bobby assured me that he would be able to tear down the entry wall to the galley kitchen and also open a pass-through on the main kitchen wall so that I’d be able to get more light into the apartment.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17107" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the project started, the new pass-through kept getting bigger and bigger until Bobby suggested I just tear down the entire wall and consider an open-concept kitchen. There was a heating pipe that obviously couldn’t be removed, and we learned that we could not move the stove to the opposite wall, so I couldn’t visualize how it would be done. Bobby is also a designer and when he provided me with a 3-D image that incorporated a hanging range hood, I was totally over the moon, though still skeptical that he could pull it off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meanwhile, I had to decide on materials and fixtures, and although I spent four years daydreaming of this big event, I totally froze and hit a wall of indecision and doubt. Do I go with shaker-style cabinets or modern gloss, Ikea or custom, pedestal sink or storage vanity, dark floors or light? Color was the only easy choice for me since I’m not a fan of color&#8230;all my picks seemed to lead to gray or white.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17097" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="kitchen with ikea cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17098" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="L-shaped kitchen remodel" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17100" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="Ringhult glossy cabinets from IKEA" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finally decided on the Ringhult glossy cabinet series from Ikea for the kitchen with white upper cabinets and gray on the bottom, split by a snow white quartz countertop. I decided on light maple for the floors after Bobby advised me to check out Hamilton Carpet One Floors in Maspeth, and I was able to floor the entire apartment with mid-size plank engineered wood at a reasonable price. The new wood flooring has a nice matte finish and really transformed the look and feel of the apartment, making it seem larger and fresher. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My last bout with indecision was at the very end. What to do about the backsplash…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I went with subway tiles in the bathroom, I was leaning toward doing the same in the kitchen. But since I was only tiling a small area, family and friends attempted to push me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to go for something bold and colorful. I didn’t go with subway tiles but I did disappoint a few folks after passing again on color and choosing a gray and white hex tile that I purchased from Home Tile Center of NY in LIC. I personally love those tiles!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17099" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="hex tile backsplash" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17101" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="butcher wood countertop" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I replaced everything in the bathroom &#8211; new tiles, new tub, new toilet, new sink, new storage. I had basic white subway tiles in mind from the start and chose a porcelain floor tile with a faux-wood finish in a large, modern size. I fit in new under-sink storage with Ikea’s Godmorgon glossy gray bathroom vanity and also added a wall-mounted cabinet facing the vanity and beveled medicine cabinet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17102" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="ikea bathroom remodel" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17103" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="bathroom mirror cabinets" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17105" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="bathroom subway tiles" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole process came together seamlessly &#8212; something you don’t hear often when it comes to renovation jobs. There were no major hiccups and Bobby helped me control costs often making cost-saving recommendations. At the end, I had extra money to modernize the hardware on all the doors and open up the entrance to my bedroom closet, installing double doors. Happily, I no longer have to stretch and reach blindly for my favorite wool sweater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next phase, in hopefully the not-too-distant future: recessed lighting!</span></p>

			<h2>An outdated, clunky space gets ready for guests in this Clinton Hill kitchen renovation</h2>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovation of a Clinton Hill kitchen for entertaining and storage<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
<strong>Before</strong></span>: A<span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen renovation was some time in the making f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or Sarah, who works in finance, and Becky, who works for a media company. Sarah had been living in the one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops since 2010 (with Becky joining her in 2013) and had her sights set on overhauling the kitchen from the get-go. A previous renovation had tiled-off the kitchen, chopping up the open living space and giving guests a clunky raised border to trip over. White appliances and heavy cabinetry were outdated, and the kitchen’s generous square footage wasn’t all that functional for hosting or entertaining. After seeing successful Sweeten rehabs featured on <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/search?q=SWEETEN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy</a>, Sarah <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3621%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her renovation project to Sweeten</a>. “It seemed like an easy solution for such a risky kind of decision,” she said. The couple was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>.</span></p>

Thankfully, their contractor was up for anything. “He’s really a nice guy, super trustworthy and very patient,” Sarah said. “He was willing to wait throughout that time while I was redesigning things.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new plan was worth the hold-up: they would tear out the L-line of cabinetry and use multiple variations on open and closed storage on each of the walls and in a central island. Plus, they geared up to create a new entry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connecting the kitchen to the hallway, improving the flow around the apartment.</span></p>

Her original vision paired the white stone composite with gray cabinets, but after looking through Ikea photo pairings, a warmer, walnut-inspired wood started to feel like a better match.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HJHiUiD4Kw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="lowest-bid-video-link-image" class="alignnone wp-image-40749 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid.jpg" alt="video link image of should i take the lowest bid by sweeten founder" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give the Ikea base cabinetry some added oomph, Sarah chose custom doors from Semihandmade. Semihandmade also provided coordinating custom paneling for the new island—a gorgeous detail with the stark white waterfall countertop. The island’s added storage freed Becky and Sarah to be more adventurous with other cabinetry choices. They skipped an upper line of cabinets on the most visible wall and went with slim open shelving made from recycled wood. White globe pendants and sconces are anchored on an intricate porcelain backsplash tile; the tile’s folded paper-style pattern adds another level of visual detail in barely-there-beige. </span></p>

The summer-long process paused when the cabinets beat the doors’ arrival by a few weeks, and delivery of a few additional custom pieces dragged until January. Her advice to future renovators: temper your eagerness to get started, knowing that your patience will pay off with a more reasonable timeline (and with all of your packages in place). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sarah and Becky didn’t love hiding out in their bedroom for a good part of the summer, the new cohesive kitchen was worth it. The couple didn’t just survive they process—they thrived: Sarah and Becky recently got engaged! “It could have torn us apart but in the end it bonded us together,” said Sarah with a laugh.</span></p>
<p><em>Thanks, Sarah and Becky, for sharing your Clinton Hill kitchen renovation with us!</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The kitchen floor now matches the rest of the apartment’s original tongue and groove parquet—thanks to the contractor&#8217;s painstaking work to cut and stain new flooring to match the original (and no longer available) planks.</span></p>
