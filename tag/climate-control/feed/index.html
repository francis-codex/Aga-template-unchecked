										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Read this handy primer, from door types—french door refrigerator or bottom freezer—to cool tech and features. Fruit-infused water dispenser, anyone?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24391 mb-10 size-chrono" title="refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-723x534.jpg" alt="refrigerator" width="723" height="534" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-723x534.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-300x222.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-600x443.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label">Kristen’s FrenKristen&#8217;s French door refrigerator bottom-mount freezer in her <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/gallery-director-perfectly-curates-apartment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovated Chelsea kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s probably the most frequently visited place in your home. It’s the hub of the kitchen. It’s the refrigerator. No other appliance sees so much action. To keep up with all of the demands made on this hard-working member of the household, manufacturers are devising new features and improvements to provide more flexibility and responsiveness. From precise climate control to wireless connectivity, the refrigerator has even greater capacity to keep food fresh and to alert you when items need replacing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While some of these innovations may not be mandatory to a functioning kitchen, they are nevertheless time-saving. They also happen to be fun.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><b>Door configurations</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arrangement of doors and drawers on your refrigerator, or refrigerator/freezer, are not just a style choice. The configuration directs how you use the fridge, and what foods you reach for most often. Classic arrangements still exist—side-by-side, bottom-mount, column—as well as newer styles, like French door and drawers. When choosing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">style</span></a>, first make a checklist of all the things you and your family take from the fridge in a given day. Each configuration has its benefits:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">*Side-by-side</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Giving access to the freezer on one side and the fridge on the other, this type is the most popular category now. The tall slender doors are also good for kitchens with little clearance space. The narrower sides do mean you lose the capacity to stow wide items like pizza boxes and party trays.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">*Bottom-mount freezer</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the freezer on the bottom, the main compartments remain at eye level, a no-brainer when the fridge is accessed more frequently than the freezer. For those times when you need the freezer just as often—during a big party, over the summer, or for frozen snacks—some fridges with two upper doors can be reprogrammed so that one side becomes the freezer, temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several manufacturers, like <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/home-appliances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GE</a>, and <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miele</a>, offer double lower freezer drawers; one of the drawers can be converted to a fridge or freezer as needed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*French door</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A variation of the bottom-mount freezer category, this model features two half-doors that open from the center (like a side-by-side), also good if you have less clearance when a door opens. You’ll still be able to get the full-width shelves in the inner compartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Column</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This refrigerator comes in a variety of widths so it can be installed wherever you want for a customized kitchen layout. Add a column freezer next to it or a couple of under-counter freezer drawers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Door-in-door</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frequent opening of the fridge door is inevitable. This leads to strain on the cooling system and a risk to food placed at the front. If yours is the family that goes in and out all day for drinks, check out the fridge from LG with the upper door that opens with the push of a button to access a slender outer beverage compartment. A tinted glass panel lets you see inside with two knocks on the glass, for those who like to graze with a gaze while deciding what they want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Drawers</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Undercounter</a></span><span class="s1"> refrigerator drawers are handy for a variety of situations, including small kitchens without much wall space, as well as a large kitchen requiring more fridge capacity for dedicated items, like drinks and snacks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Top-mounted freezer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This type falls into the most economical category (remember your starter apartment?). However, it offers the least capacity, and you have to bend over to retrieve most items in the fridge. Not so cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cooling for all</b></span></p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10103">The constant opening and closing of the fridge places a burden on the cooling system of the refrigerator and on the food inside. The variety of items also presents a challenge, as not all perishables keep well at the same temperature—or even together in the same drawer. Some foods, placed together, can even speed each other’s spoilage.</p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10105">Manufacturers have responded with independent humidity and temperature control for compartments. Miele makes a refrigerator with drawers that offer individual microclimates. With the touch of an icon, the drawer will keep lettuce crisp one week and safely store cheese another. Jenn-Air has a quick-chill feature that lowers the temperature to below liquid freezing for one hour, great for that spur-of-the-moment bottle of wine.</p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10196">Some new fridges come with separate cooling circuits for refrigeration and freezing sections. The benefit: Independent control of each section contributes to peak function. Since there’s no air exchange between compartments, it also keeps food from drying out. <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.subzero-wolf.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497730836836000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9637qnK0KHCvDfmC45nx5IwTHQg">Sub-Zero</a> has introduced an antimicrobial filtration system that clears airborne bacteria and prevents the transferring of odors or ethylene gas (emitted by some vegetables) that can speed food spoilage.</p>

You might also be able to access recipes from a popular cooking site and have the recipe read to you as you work at the prep counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><b>Ice and water perks</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Water and ice in the door aren’t new, but new functions have been added, including:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Ice cubes small enough to fit into refillable water bottles</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Ice and water dispensed at the same time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Shaved ice, perfect for smoothies or seafood platters</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Remote manufacturing of ice ordered from your mobile phone</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* An integrated compartment that holds fruit for infused water</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* High-capacity ice maker</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Sparkling water dispenser</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Probably no other appliance in the kitchen can combine so many innovations as the refrigerator. The future points toward the development of more special features, some that we can’t even imagine yet. In the meantime, you can, at a minimum, enjoy state-of-the-art cooling systems that save you money on electricity and grocery bills. And that’s always cool.</span></p>

<p>The fridge is easily the most-used appliance in the kitchen, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be the centerpiece. With <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom paneling</a>, your fridge can blend into its surroundings and let another feature, like a standout <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a>, take center stage.</p>

</a>Photo: Sub-Zero/Wolf</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much talk today about creating a “smart home”—since the kitchen is usually the busiest room of the house, it has the opportunity to be the most intelligent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choices for kitchen appliances are driven by how the cookspace is used on a daily basis, what minimizes labor, and what cuts down cooking time. Take into consideration the steam oven cooking 3x faster or the dishwasher that packs more in a single cycle. Whether you are a gourmet chef or simply someone who likes good meals with minimal effort, the following features will help you to work smarter in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Combination convection-steam oven</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to consumers’ desire for healthy meals that can be prepared in shorter-than-usual times comes the steam-assist oven. Usually combined with a convection feature, this oven circulates air for more even cooking and emits steam for juicier results with meat, chicken, and fish. Together, these functions can also reduce cooking time by as much as a third to a half, and that means a lower energy bill. This oven is great for reheating food the next day without drying it out. If you don’t want to commit to the triple-thousand-dollar price tag or switch out your present oven at the moment, there are countertop versions available from companies like Cuisinart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Induction cooktop</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not brand new to the scene, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank">induction</a> continues to innovate, ensuring its place in the working-smart kitchen appliances category. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Precision cooking</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Induction works by connecting to the size of the pan, heating only where it’s needed. This reduces energy waste from an open gas flame or an exposed electrical element that emits heat outside of its center of contact. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stay safe</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area around the cooking zone also stays relatively cool, as opposed to electric coils or the grate above a gas burner. So you don’t have to worry about an accidental burn. Look for added safety features such as automatic turnoff in the case of extreme heat or if a cooking zone operates for a particularly long time. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save time</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some manufacturers, like Thermador, offer an induction cooktop with memory, so if you move a pan to another area of the surface, all the programmed settings will be transferred to the new location of the pan, eliminating the need to re-jigger that perfect heat adjustment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fridges with climate-controlled compartments </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication centers that take and send messages, and software that stores and transmits recipes are getting a lot of attention right now, but one factor remains constant: among the top complaints homeowners have for their refrigerators is food waste. Not that it’s the fridge’s fault, but the greater the capacity—and capacity is a major factor in selection—the more likely the cucumbers will get shoved to the back of the drawer, only to be discovered when they have become a slimy mess. To answer this, manufacturers have fine-tuned climate control with drawers that include dedicated convertible temperature settings so the cheese stays fresh and the lettuce crisp in their neighboring compartments. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refrigerator drawers such as those from Fisher &amp; Paykel offer subtle climate control for maximum flexibility when you toggle between the need for extra fridge or freezer space, or even to perfectly chill wine for a party.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Third-rack dishwasher</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the operation of a dishwasher is surely a science, the loading of the dishwasher is something of an art. The range of contents—dishes, pans, flatware, mixing bowls, hinged utensils—can require imagination and strategy to place them effectively for the best wash. With the addition of a third rack that can be adjusted to customize loads, many of those odd and oversized items, like sheet-cake pans and serving trays, can be cleaned at the same time as a complete load of dinner dishes, saving time, electricity, and water. Another option: twin removable trays that can be positioned to allow long-stemmed wine glasses on one side while stowing all the flatware in a rack atop the salad bowls on the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hands-free faucet</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have two options here: a motion sensor in the shank of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank">faucet</a> that detects the wave of a hand to turn on the water, or a touch-sensitive version that operates with gentle pressure from the back of the wrist or elbow. The benefit is time (and water) saved in clean-up since you don’t have to wash down the handles repeatedly during the course of preparing a meal.</span></p>
