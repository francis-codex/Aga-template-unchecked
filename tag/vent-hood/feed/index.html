			<h2>Whether done in houses or co-ops, kitchen renovations for families make life easier</h2>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you have young children, you realize quickly what does and doesn’t work about the space you’re in. Common issues are a lack of storage or insufficient dining space. Perhaps you need a better flow between rooms. Or, it might be all of the above.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, three Sweeten renovations show how parents transformed kitchens and bathrooms into spaces that work for their families—adding functionality and, of course, beautiful form to their homes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a></span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>Borrowed Space Makes the Difference for a Brooklyn Kitchen</h3>

<h4>An inhospitable kitchen</h4>
<p>Betsy, a teacher, and Zach, an executive at a retail company, live in a two-bedroom, two-bath duplex garden apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The couple now has Amina, age 2, and two dogs, Tristen and Archie. Their duplex in a 19th-century brownstone was in decent shape but didn’t quite match their design aesthetic.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><span class="s4">They held off on renovating for a few years, but once Amina was born, they decided to take the plunge and finally renovate to have their home suit their ever-changing needs. They wanted to make the most of their 1,200-square-foot main floor. “</span><span class="s1">We bought knowing we would ultimately like to renovate, but the apartment was pretty updated; it just wasn’t our aesthetic,” said Betsy. “We had been living in the space for nearly three years, and the kitchen was especially difficult.” The refrigerator was apartment-sized and the peninsula-shaped design meant that only one person could be in the space at a time. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">So <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28307#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betsy and Zach posted their project</a> on Sweeten to find a general contractor who could help with all of their design challenges and in addition fix the poor lighting in the main living area. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Mixing old with modern elements</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To make more room and utilize the space more efficiently, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Sweeten contractor</a> reduced the size of the hall bathroom to add a bit more space to the tiny kitchen. The floors were converted from a dated yellow to a beautiful hardwood. They added a mix of traditional elements (classic hardwood floors) with a modern aesthetic (flat-panel cabinets). Multiple sources of lighting like a chandelier were installed over the main table as well as high hats to keep the open space bright and airy.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-with-cabinetry" class="alignnone wp-image-50708 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg" alt="white open kitchen with cabinetry and dining nook on a hardwood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-closed-cabinetry" class="alignnone wp-image-50707 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7.jpg" alt="White kitchen closed cabinetry with cooking range and chimney over wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="brown-wooden-pull-out-storage" class="alignnone wp-image-50709 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2.jpg" alt="Natural brown wooden pull out storage with for pantry after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our Sweeten contractor was great in every small decision, from the pull-out storage options for utensils to hiding the unsightly microwave in a garage cabinet to making the fridge seamlessly blend into the cabinetry—a big feat considering we now have a 36” french door refrigerator,” said Betsy. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When asked about her advice for renovators, Betsy had this to say: “Be smart about your budget. We went with a quote that was comfortably below our bottom line, and this gave us the flexibility to spend more in certain areas and save in others without constantly being stressed about going over.”</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeking space to grow</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Paul, a collegiate swim coach, and Margaret, a pediatric nurse practitioner, bought their 1,</span><span class="s1">700-square-foot, two-bedroom condo, they knew they wanted to renovate it right away. “We had been living in the Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, but wanted more space for a growing family,” said Paul. “North Bergen’s mix of affordability, family-friendly amenities, and proximity to work appealed to us.” However, to make the house family-friendly, they turned to Sweeten. </span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul and Margaret posted their project </a>on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired a general contractor</a> to renovate their kitchen. “Sweeten was helpful in showing us qualified contractors in our area,” said Paul. “Being New Jersey residents, we valued Sweeten’s referral model.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They wanted a contractor who could take their kitchen into the 21st century, updating their old laminate-and-tile kitchen into a more modern space. They wished for additional counter space as well as storage—common must-haves for a young family. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new layout brings high impact results</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-granite-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50717 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="White kitchen with granite countertop along with double door fridge after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-glass-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50714 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White kitchen with glass countertop on a kitchen peninsula after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinetry-with-black-granite" class="alignnone wp-image-50716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="White kitchen cabinetry with black granite countertop and double hung window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple worked with the firm to give their space a clean, contemporary feel without having to do a major overhaul. They didn’t remove or move any walls but they were able to reconfigure the existing layout to work better for their family. They extended the countertop and added cabinetry for additional storage. Plus, they included a nod to New York by way of a simple subway tile backsplash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our contractor was helpful in keeping the project moving despite material delays and the start of the pandemic,” said Paul. These first-time renovators could not be happier with their now user-friendly new kitchen. </span></p>

<h4>Reduce clutter, expand livable space</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A 1925 side-hall colonial was in need of a remodel for homeowners Jennifer and Sauyee. They made plans to live in the 1,740-square-foot home in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, for a few years before embarking on a renovation. With two small children, they wanted to make sure when they did decide to renovate that they could pinpoint exactly what was needed to make their busy lives more convenient and comfortable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The layout lacked usable counter space and had way too many countertop appliances to be functional. Plus, the flow from the kitchen to the rest of the house needed to be reconsidered to make it more family-friendly. They also desperately wanted more usable space and a lighter, brighter vibe. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The finished product is a more modern, usable space—one that reflects the couple’s personality and everyday needs. The pantry unit is perfect for the kids’ snacks as well as additional storage for their kitchen essentials. And even though it is not as obvious as some of the other aesthetic details, the homeowners are equally appreciative of the properly vented range hood. As a family of four, cooking is very important and any cook knows a bad vent hood can be a real nuisance. So, it was an upgrade they really wanted. They chose gray Shaker cabinets, light quartz countertops, and redid the hardwood floors throughout to make a cohesive design statement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-dining-space-with-dining-table" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50727 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White dining space with dining table on a hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-walk-in-shower" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50730" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="White bathroom with walk in shower along with a pedestal washbasin and a rectangle bathroom mirror" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, they decided to also remodel the bathroom since the kitchen was getting a facelift. They went with a gray color palette: <span class="s5">light, marble-style tile for the floor and shower wall, with an accent dark, geometric shower floor. But t</span><span class="s1">heir favorite part? The heated floors—appreciated by the kids and adults alike. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple who loves to cook creates a waterfall counter as a welcoming perch for friends and family</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26527" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project</span>: Open up a tiny kitchen in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Amy and Nick were looking for a new home and wanted a place that was either move-in ready or didn’t need a lot of work. Things changed when they came across a 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that made perfect sense but needed a complete overhaul, so they decided to buy it and put aside money to make the space their own. The kitchen was outdated and enclosed in a small, triangular-shaped nook in the main living area, while the fridge was awkwardly placed outside of it. Because of the narrow shape of the kitchen, there was limited counter space and no room for lower cabinets. Also, the tile floor in the kitchen didn’t match the wood floor that ran throughout the rest of the living area, a look that made the space feel disjointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: To kick things off, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten and were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The gut renovation began with demolishing the walls that made up the triangular nook to make way for a new layout in the kitchen. All of the old molding throughout the apartment was removed and replaced with crisp new trim. The entire apartment was also skim coated—walls, ceilings, doors, and moldings—and given a fresh coat of paint. Moving the sink meant checking under the floorboards to see if the support beams would allow piping to run in the direction needed to relocate it. Most of the support beams ran in the opposite direction, but luckily they switched direction under the kitchen area, allowing Amy and Nick to install the new sink as planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall counter</a> on the island was fabricated in Calacatta gold marble and continued along the rest of the kitchen prep areas. Amy explained, &#8220;We wanted the kitchen island to be a centerpiece of the room, and we were looking for a surface that was beautiful to fill the space. The Calacatta gold marble slab we chose was the first slab we saw at the stone yard, and we just loved the contrasting veins and its uniqueness. The inspiration for the waterfall was that we wanted to take full advantage of all the beautiful material we had. We also used the leftover marble for the bathroom—it&#8217;s in the vanity, the windowsill, and the threshold.&#8221; The marble also has a honed surface, rather than polished, which helps with wear and tear. To complement the marble waterfall counter and countertops, a large, white elongated <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> was chosen for the backsplash. Storage was added in the form of pre-fab upper and lower cabinets with a glossy, acrylic finish to replace the original wood cabinetry, complete with a custom-made pantry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All new Bosch appliances—dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave—provided a much-needed functional upgrade. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pendant lighting</a> was added over the island and recessed lighting was installed throughout the kitchen and the rest of the living area to brighten up the space. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. &#8220;We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Amy found the backsplash tile on Pinterest and searched online for it everywhere until she came across the manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Larson.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Style finds</span>: Backsplash tile: Pratt &amp; Larson. Dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave: <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>. Pendant lights: <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily&#8217;s kitchen</a>, moving the sink to the peninsula not only added some breathing space, it allowed her to extend the length of her cabinets without worrying about having enough clearance below them for washing up.</p>
