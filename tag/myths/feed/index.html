<p><em>Welcome to #16 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>

<div><strong>QUESTION: What&#8217;s the biggest myth about general contractors?</strong></div>
<div><strong>JEAN: </strong>I love this question! One of the biggest myths about general contractors is that they want projects to go on for a long time. We&#8217;ve heard homeowners say things like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s trying to stretch out the project. He wants it to, you know, go on forever.&#8221; The truth is, general contractors want exactly the opposite. Each day they have workers on your project is another day that they have to incur labor costs. Their ideal project is one that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starts and ends exactly on the schedule</a> they laid out so they can take that crew and move them to another project. General contractors do not want your project to go on indefinitely. They want it to be done as quickly as possible—just like you do—and they want to do it well.</div>
