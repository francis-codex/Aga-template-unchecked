										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When advertising executives Lia and Chris Wollen made the leap to homeownership, they didn’t have to go far. A waterfront condo, just four blocks from their Williamsburg rental, called to them with bridge views and appealing amenities. After envisioning the possibility of a townhouse, square footage in the two-bedroom was a concern, but with a stunning kitchen and bathroom renovation, plus strategic spending and saving in a few key spots, Sweeten helped them make this home their own (with time to spare for the arrival of a new baby this winter!). Read on for Lia’s take on this beautiful project.</em></p>

</span>Guest post by Williamsburg homeowner Lia Wollen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three years of renting in Williamsburg, the time came to try and buy a place. My husband, Chris, and I hoped to find a spacious townhouse or something bigger than our current place. Planning for a family and wanting outdoor space, we felt that broadening our search to less trendy neighborhoods was our only option. After exploring most of Brooklyn, however, we found that we kept coming back to Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six months into our search, standing just four blocks south of our rental and looking out at the East River from the roof deck of a two-bedroom on the market, Chris said, “Well, if we can do this, then I want this.” It was a top floor unit with a small terrace off the living room, high ceilings, tons of light, and views of the Domino Sugar Factory, the river, and Manhattan. It came with basement storage, a parking space, and a piece of the private roof deck. Square footage was a concern, and we agreed that we would have to do a renovation before moving in to accommodate long-term needs, but first, the offer. Ours was accepted.</p>
<p>I found Sweeten in a general contractor search online and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filled out the project post form</a> to be matched with general contractors. Not too long after that initial search, I saw a blog post like this one, of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another gorgeous Sweeten renovation</a>. One of the photos looked right out at the Domino Sugar Factory—a replica of our new view! I realized pretty quickly it was a condo from our building and emailed Sweeten to ask them for the contractor. They connected us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. We met with him to kick things off and were thrilled with the fit and his vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56286 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56285 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of our renovation was the kitchen and bath. I love to cook and wanted a hard-working, welcoming space to gather in. The bathroom needed a feeling of calm, an escape from the city. Our contractor was strategic with us in his approach. He started big so that we could see the possibilities, and then collectively, we pulled each other back to set reasonable expectations. This process was critical when it came to prioritizing our wants and needs and managing the dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating, but it was the beautiful and technical unifier underneath everything we were trying to accomplish. The contractor addressed the kitchen simply: hide the fridge, fill in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and provide more counter/storage space. This blew our minds. It cleaned up the whole space and looked like a kitchen that meant to be there, rather than an afterthought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting proposal from our contractor was to open up the ceiling and expose building beams that were encased in the walls of the kitchen and living room. This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements, playing off of the raw materials mirrored across the street at Domino. We achieved separation of living room and kitchen while retaining warmth in the space, by limiting how far we (and our budget) extended the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another small but important detail was the flooring. The contractor and his team buffed out the overly lacquered yellow floors to get back down to raw wood, and we chose a sky gray matte stain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were other more indulgent decisions made during the planning process, like a wine fridge. This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it. Chris insisted from day one that we have a garbage disposal, so that was non-negotiable. We also debated and ultimately agreed to a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertops. Our contractor had strongly recommended this as a focal point when entering the home, and he was absolutely right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the bath, we kept the tub, sink, and hardware, but had everything retiled. We used leftover marble from the kitchen for the tub and installed a glass shower partition to open up the small space. We also built a new medicine cabinet and drawer for the sink to accommodate storage, and I found some new light fixtures to modern it up a bit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and I have a very similar aesthetic, so choosing materials, appliances, and fixtures was pretty straightforward. Before construction, I spent a lot of time pulling looks and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view right away. My must-have was a Wolf Range with the iconic red knobs. Snobby, kinda, but an important design element in an otherwise minimalist kitchen. The thing is also a weapon! (Chris started a grease fire the first time we used it.) Keeping in line with the stainless steel, we also bought a new Bosch dishwasher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Material choices included Carrara marble, beveled and plain white subway tile with dark grout, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and glossy white cabinets. We chose IKEA cabinets because of another Sweeten renovation I caught on Instagram. It was very important to me that the cabinets went as high as they could go. I wanted an excess of clean-looking storage space and was not interested in dusting open shelving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56287 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners in their renovated kitchen" width="1000" height="1494" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were easy-going clients who trusted our contractor and his vision. We made things easier by not changing our minds and being open to his direction when we were undecided on something. The biggest decision, which we labored over the longest, was whether or not the kitchen should remain galley-style. The choice is obvious now, but there was something tempting at the time about toeing that suburban-house line with a big island to gather around. After the renovation, any concerns with square footage more or less went away. More, because we made so much out of what existed, and less because in March we found out we are expecting a baby boy this month!</p>

<p>For us, a fixer-upper was a must.</p>
<p>There was the professional itch; as an interior designer for an architecture firm specializing in Brooklyn brownstones, I had house-envy. I had a Pinterest board called &#8220;Someday house ideas&#8221; slowly filling with the most affordable versions of all my favorite finishes. It has 600 pins.</p>
<p>And then there was practicality; although we loved our huge and quirky one-bedroom in Boerum Hill, it had no way to create a second bedroom and no access to the sleeping area except a dizzying spiral staircase. Time to move on.</p>
<p>In our (VERY) stressful house hunt, we were the runner-up offer on four houses before The One. It was an unusually wide two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington, around the corner from my husband’s elementary school. The block is tiny and quiet, across from a beautiful gatehouse of Greenwood Cemetery. There is a bountiful apricot tree in the front yard and a huge grapevine in the back. There was even—the Brooklyn equivalent of a tennis court or horse stables—a driveway.  But the best part was the friendly atmosphere. Many of our neighbors have lived their entire lives on this block, and we were thrilled to join them.</p>
<p>It was a major job, though. The home had only one owner since it was built in 1941, and it had been decades since the home had been well-maintained. Everything practical had to go: plumbing, gorgeous-but-ruined steel windows, cloth-wrapped aluminum electrical wiring that the home inspector begged us to replace &#8220;so I can sleep at night. Really. Please. PLEASE.&#8221;</p>
<p>The structure was great, however, and it was full of personality and charm. I adored the arched doorways and beautiful 1950s Caloric stove, and I wanted to maintain &#8217;40s details even where everything would be new. I collected bright and cheerful images of tiled bathrooms, Airstream-inspired kitchens, and patterned floors. I prepared a full set of construction drawings, selected all my finishes, and looked for a contractor.</p>
<p>I know some general contractors that my office uses, but I wanted to keep my personal renovation separate to avoid conflicts of interest. I was thrilled to find Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>, and then selected a contractor from a list of really excellent matches. I got pregnant, and the clock began to tick as we ran into a contract delay with the team we’d chosen. I was paralyzed with stress, back at square one with a due date and a house full of lead paint and death-wiring, holed up in the basement with my belongings around my ears like a hoarder. There was some crying. But I called Sweeten, and they swooped into action. Within 48 hours, they had amicably resolved the issue and found me three new excellent contractors to interview, all of whom could start immediately. Our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> was particularly impressive, calling me with thoughtful questions about my drawing set and offering ideas for cost-savings. I could not believe how fast the Sweeten team saved the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our house was originally a two-bedroom apartment on the top floor, with a duplex on the first floor and garden level. But at some point, the garden level had been finished as an apartment in its own right, and we preferred to have our duplex upstairs with rentable space on the bottom. By eliminating the need for a separate entrance to the second floor, we were able to open up the center staircase to the living room and turn the entry from a dark, tiny box into an open alcove, flooding the front of the house with light. The difference has been amazing.</p>
<p>We also took advantage of a neat arched niche that sat between two closets in the bedroom on the first floor. The back wall of this niche was up against the kitchen, and by punching through, we created a doorway from the kitchen into what is now the dining room. Suddenly there was a clear view all the way through the house, without removing the lovely original details.</p>

<p>The kitchen was designed around the amazing old stove and a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge that I found for a song at Build It Green in Gowanus. The front panel was a dark glossy charcoal, which was already what I had been thinking about for my lower cabinets. It was fate. I did the uppers in matte white, with a pretty hand-made subway tile that has an uneven surface that reflects light softly. I like to have my cooking ingredients out all the time, so I had the cabinets installed unusually high to fit a shelf for jars underneath. The counters are a honed Jet Mist granite, which gave me the look of soapstone without any of its typical green tint, which would have clashed with my Sub-Zero.</p>
<p>I snagged a vintage enamel sink from BIG, and paired it with the restaurant-style sprayer faucet of my dreams from Signature Hardware. It lives up to the hype. Our most unusual score was the island, which I happened upon one night as I drove down the block on my way home from work. It’s an amazing furniture piece that a neighbor was throwing away, exactly the perfect dimension for our kitchen. Although I planned to replace the top with butcher block, I have so loved the wavy green tiles that I’ve kept it just as I found it.</p>

<p>Our other first-floor change was to shrink the original full bath down to a powder room, using the space that housed the tub as a walk-in pantry off the kitchen. The original baths were all an intense pink with raspberry accents &#8211; pink walls, pink floor, pink toilet, pink tub. Every pink its very own shade! The coolest discovery came in peeling off the wild pink floral wallpaper; directly on the original walls, we found delicate hand-painted Chinoiserie scenes of a river, swans, and boats. A neighbor told us that all the houses had them, but that slowly over the years they’ve been lost. Sadly, it was badly damaged, so we only have photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new powder room is wonderful, though, and a better use for our space. I used a salvaged pedestal sink and a window from Olde Good Things for a high transom, so the room isn’t entirely cut off from its original window. And at long last, we found a home for the Brooklyn Toile wallpaper from Flavor Paper (made just one block away from our old apartment!), which was designed by Mike D from the Beastie Boys. My husband spent years longing for this paper, which features a dreamy mix of Notorious B.I.G. and angelic Nathan’s hot dogs and men in fur hats and Park Slope stroller mommies. I picked a cement floor tile of navy and gray plaid, had the paper custom-matched to it, and then papered the hall just outside it with my favorite Schumacher print of completely nuts-o Tibetan tigers. Because my clients never let me have that much fun.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The other layout updates were upstairs, where we turned a kitchen into the master bathroom and closet of my dreams. The new shower is about the size of the studio I lived in during grad school. The tiles in there were my biggest splurge, with a pretty &#8217;40s-inspired white and blue marble floor and cornflower blue walls with period-appropriate black tile trim. In fact, I used a thread of either blue or orange throughout the whole house, which helped tie together my otherwise colorful selections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upstairs had the same arched niche which we again punched through for flow, and stole some closet space to create a linen closet in the hall. We repurposed original doors, which have amazing Deco knobs and backplates. The original bath’s odd standing shower became a washer-dryer unit.</p>

<p>Our son’s bathroom, beyond losing its shower to the washer-dryer, kept its layout with cosmetic updates only. I found a cornflower blue penny round for the floor, with family-friendly gray grout that hides the dirt, and paired it with white subway tile and a cobalt blue bullnose tile. The black vanity is made to look like a repurposed dresser, but it is actually a sneaky Restoration Hardware reproduction that matches the one in the master bath. My favorite touch is the shower, with its pretty vintage-style handheld showerhead and its huge oversized rain head.</p>

<p>Our son&#8217;s nursery was the room I was most itching to decorate as the renovation finished. The dresser is vintage, and I made blinds by cannibalizing a Home Depot shade with a Spoonflower fabric of wonderful tigers, to whom we now bid goodnight in our bedtime routine. The mobile was a gift from his grandmother, from an artist she knows in Brooklyn whose Etsy shop (AllySen) sells similar creations. Lucy Goosey, the giant plastic goose nightlight, is a particular favorite and another gift from family. We tried to scatter family throughout the room, from photos and cards to the quilt hanging above the crib, made for my husband when he was born. I was a very happy camper when that room was finished before our son, Mac, arrived!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As for other original details, we tried to reuse a few light fixtures, but only one held up to re-wiring. The rest were mostly purchased from Schoolhouse Electric and Y Lighting. The floors were refinished with a wonderful no-VOC satin-finish natural oil product called Rubio Monocoat, which everyone loves when they visit. And my contractor and the crew thought I was crazy to replicate the original black windows with their traditional mullions, but they fit the Tudor style of the house perfectly, and I was adamant. Luckily, the guys all changed their minds when they were installed and stained. Or they were polite enough to pretend.</p>
<p>Throughout the project—completed on-budget and on-time, a minor miracle—I was so happy to see the crew every morning. I do NOT recommend living in the basement during a renovation unless you know exactly what you’re getting into, but it was our only option, and the crew was wonderful. It also made meetings a breeze, as I would pop upstairs on my way to work, discussing any questions that had arisen the day before. The crew&#8217;s foreman was reliable in every way, particularly for solving problems intelligently and with an eye for design. He is worth his weight in gold.</p>
<p>In the end, we made our deadline, but more importantly, we made the home I had hoped for. I used to stand in the half-framed kitchen, imagining our little boy padding around the loop made by our newly-opened doorways. Sure enough, every night Mac does his laps, chasing the cats and toppling over onto floors that the team patched and sanded and made to look like they have always been this way. We love our old stove, although the left burners have to be lit with a match. We love our neighbors, and the stories they tell of all the families who have come through over the years. We made this old home new again, and for that, I am deeply grateful to Sweeten and our Sweeten contractor and all the rest.</p>

<p>We continue to putter with smaller projects: painting the garage door, glamming up the entry with our practical and beautiful Shoe-seum (I am slowly being edged out by my husband’s sneakers). Perhaps if we ever manage to tackle the backyard, we will have another Sweeten post for the scary concrete underground wine cellar that turns everything into mildew. But for now, we are enjoying our small projects after the big project was handled by the pros.</p>

</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jamie, Queens homeowner  </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband and I dreamt of buying a brownstone in Bed-Stuy. This dream was apparently shared by everyone else in New York, because trying to find a place—any place—was a humbling experience in getting outbid by foreign investors and other first-time buyers with resources greater than ours. After a year of frustration, we found a condo in a recently remodeled brick building in Ridgewood, Queens—a quirky little Polish-Ecuadorian neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border that none of our friends had ever heard of. The good news was that the apartment was huge: the building’s original six units had been merged into three, giving us a yard and a finished basement to go with our ground-floor living space.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news was that the renovations had been undertaken in an aesthetic that my husband and I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">described as “late-life Euro bachelor”: dark wood fixtures and liberal use of large brown Tuscan tiles that gave certain rooms the yellowish air of an Adirondack rental property you’d regret renting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17412 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first year in Ridgewood was dominated by DIY projects—refacing cabinets, painting, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gardening—that improved the overall look of our apartment. The projects that remained were too complicated to be mastered through YouTube videos and trial-and-error, which put us on the market for a contractor to do some larger projects. First in line: our trainwreck of a master bathroom, which when we bought the apartment had been renovated in a very dark (read: creepy) and not-so-functional (read: the showerhead didn’t line up with the tub) way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our search for a contractor stretched over a year. I interviewed people from all over—recommendations from coworkers and friends of friends, names from Brownstoner’s community forum, references in interior design books. There was also Angie’s List, which was effective in introducing me to a series of contractors from Long Island and Brooklyn who were well-versed in bathrooms that featured lots of fogged glass and Jacuzzis—not the bright, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELLE</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Décor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-type vibe I was going for. These candidates would generally show up, late and complaining about parking in my neighborhood, then tell me how the fixtures I wanted were going to be too expensive for my budget, how they thought the current bathroom was fine as-is, how I should do a better job training my dogs not to bark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like a series of first dates that I knew were going to be awful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in the process I had read about Sweeten, but let’s be clear: I was far too jaded to be anything but skeptical. I went to their site and decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of sheer desperation. They first connected me with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and from day one, I was impressed. He showed up on time, listened carefully to what I was hoping to achieve, and demonstrated strong attention to detail, noticing things like the slope of the floors and the fact that the recessed lights were out of alignment. He was quick to turn around a quote (some contractors took weeks; others required me to follow up multiple times), and was very responsive to my many emails regarding questions and concerns. I took the leap and hired him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17413"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17413 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the start, working with Erion and his team was a delight. They showed up promptly at 9am each day, motivated and ready to begin work. And these guys worked hard! I swear, I barely saw them stop to eat! Construction debris and dust is part of the deal when you embark on a project like this, but Erion and his team were extremely tidy and took extra care to protect our house and hardwood floors. Even at the end of demo day, our house was surprisingly clean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of my experience with Erion was his openness to what I wanted and his tireless pursuit of making this a reality. I wanted a bright, clean, fresh, and timeless space—something that would age well with the house and provide a spa-like atmosphere. This bathroom has no natural light, so I made sure to choose materials that reflected light (beveled mirrors, polished nickel fixtures, high-gloss paint). Erion considered all my sourcing decisions, weighing in where I asked him to and letting me handle things everywhere else. I spent a lot of time researching the fixtures I wanted and although the approach was a bit piecemeal (and largely dictated by stores for which I had gift cards), it worked.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the tile we wanted to keep it light and clean and I worked with the lovely people at Ann Sacks. Their showroom is beautiful, pricing competitive, and customer service exceptional. On the bathroom floor, we chose large marble squares (16 x 16) with a honed finish because it’s not as slippery as polished marble and tends to show fewer scratches. We also decided to install radiant heat to keep our toes warm in winter. For the shower walls, I knew I wanted a larger tile (less grout to clean!) but something with a bit more character than subway tile. At first, I was unsure about going with a handmade 6 x 18 tile because each cut was slightly different, but in the end it turned out beautifully and the hand-made nature of the tile gave it a textured appearance that we absolutely love. As for the shower floors, we did a micro-mosaic which makes me happy every time I look down at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As unexpected challenges or issues arose—as they always do in remodeling—Erion handled them with a calm demeanor, thoroughly explaining my options and letting me know how they would affect factors such as time and cost. He would talk through the pros and cons of various options and together we would make a decision on how to move forward. At no point did I ever feel steamrolled, or like he was cutting corners. Erion demonstrated an exceptional dedication to quality and was just as concerned as I was that everything be done right and look good. The end result is a beautifully serene space and the sort of justification for all my time and anguish that I’d hoped for.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postscript: While writing this blog post, our apartment suffered severe water damage from a neighbor’s apartment. The silver lining in this situation is that we knew exactly who to call and who we could trust to do the work. Erion dropped everything to help us navigate this urgent situation, going above and beyond to help us triage damage and map a way forward. He has truly become our technical and professional liaison for maintaining and improving our largest investment, and the confidence I have in his practices, tastes, and commitment to quality cannot be overstated. Thank you, Sweeten, for connecting us.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Their dream space comes to life with herringbone tile, gray kitchen cabinets, and a clawfoot tub</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Editor&#8217;s Note: This post, originally published May 2014, is one of our favorites for still having a classic and modern look years later. Allison and Jovito purchased their first home together—a single-family brick row house, c. 1910, in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn. Though they knew the place needed some serious renovations, Allison, a content manager, and Jovito, an electronic prepress director, both in textbook publishing, promptly packed up and, along with their adorable cat, Momo, moved in and geared up for some major home improvements. Allison shares their renovation story and walks us through the stylish choices she and Jovito made in the process of creating their new home.</i><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24064 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-723x493.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="493" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-723x493.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-300x205.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Guest post by Allison in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten months of intense searching, eight lost bids and a couple hundred viewed properties later, Jovito and I finally found an adorable 1910 brick row house in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn to call our own. We loved the bones and original details of the house, but the over 100-year-old home was also in need of some serious updating. Knowing that we’d have some large-scale renovations ahead of us, we went into the purchase two parts excited and one part slightly terrified.  There was a long list of items on our “fix” list when we moved in, but we also had a limited budget. So our energy and efforts were focused on tackling the kitchen and upstairs bathroom renovation first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having never renovated a property before, we didn’t know where to start. How would we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a reputable contractor</a> that would understand our vision, work within our budget, and do a stellar job? Perusing Apartment Therapy on a day when I was feeling somewhat overwhelmed by all our options, I read about Sweeten and decided to post <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our project</a> to the site. We really liked the idea that they would act as matchmakers and pair us with contractors based on our project’s scope of work and budget. Knowing that they had pre-screened their network of contractors also made choosing feel a lot less scary.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After meeting with two contractor matches from Sweeten, and two contractors that were friend referrals, we decided to award our renovation job to Sweeten. We appreciated his pragmatism, patience in answering our many questions, and his thoroughness during the onsite visit. We also appreciated that he seemed completely un-phased by the scary (to us), timeworn, “before” conditions of the kitchen and bathroom. He’d seen and worked on old houses like this many times, so that also helped us feel like we were in good hands. His familiarity with constructing IKEA kitchens and reasonable estimate sealed the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started our renovation of the kitchen and bathroom in mid-November. Living in the house during construction wasn’t fun, but our contractor and his team were careful to keep the work area as clean and contained as possible. On the plus side, it was exciting for us to see the team’s daily progress and some of the relics they unearthed during demolition. (Like pieces of newspaper from 1943 mentioning President Roosevelt stuck inside the bathroom walls!) The team spent a lot of time and effort making sure the new walls and floors were level, plumb, and true, which was no small feat in an old house where nothing is straight!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen needed a gut renovation. The walls were covered with dark wood paneling and cabinets, there was a dropped ceiling with fluorescent lighting, cracked floor tile and beat up Formica countertops and backsplash. The existing soffit ran in front of the kitchen window, cutting a good eight inches off the top, and a lot of daylight along with it. It was a less-than-optimal layout and had definitely seen better days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of our limited <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>, we decided to go with IKEA kitchen cabinetry and Caesarstone quartz countertops, both of which we purchased during one of IKEA’s kitchen sales. Not wanting the new kitchen to clash with the age of the house but also wanting it to feel current and new, we went with a more traditional cabinet door style in a medium gray color. To keep the space open and airy feeling, we decided to forego wall cabinets. We made sure we had plenty of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet storage</a> to hold all our pots and pans. Because we removed the dropped ceiling, we gained back some ceiling height, so we stacked glass-front cabinets to the ceiling and created a hutch to display our collection of vintage glassware and serveware. We chose durable white quartz countertops to keep the room bright and to add contrast to the gray cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24048 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-723x525.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="525" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24049 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re tough on our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>, so we chose extra durable wood-look porcelain tile that we found online at a closeout price. Our contractor laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. We really love the way it turned out! For the backsplash tile, we went with a large format porcelain tile with a raised geometric pattern and tiled all the way up the wall for visual impact. (It’s also incredibly <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy to clean</a>!) The wall tile is from Mondial in Bensonhurst.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We both love to cook so it was important for us to have a range that could accommodate many pots and pans and put out some serious BTUs. We were incredibly lucky to find our range second-hand in excellent condition at a local salvage shop. The exhaust hood was found in the clearance section of Home Depot and our brand new dishwasher came from the As-Is section of IKEA. Our counter-depth fridge was on sale at the local P.C.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our ceiling light fixtures are porcelain lamp holders made by Leviton running about $2/piece online. The pendant over the sink is from Restoration Hardware and is based off an Italian factory light from the 1950s. We like that the lights can extend out about four feet on each side, giving us the option of creating more overhead <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> for prep if we need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to go with brass cabinet pulls, knobs, and faucet to warm up all the cool gray and stainless steel. It took a lot of searching to find a brushed brass faucet, but we finally found one through Newport Brass. The solid brass pulls and knobs are made by Laurey and were also found online.</p>
<p class="alignnone" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11333 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-01.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen bathroom renovation" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24054 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our bathroom was very…blue. Blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. It had last been majorly renovated in the 50s and everything was really showing its age. The floor of the bathroom was about a 4” step up from the hallway—the ghosts of past flooring renovations buried beneath. To top it all off, the bathroom space itself was tiny—about 36 square feet. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> wouldn’t allow us to enlarge the space or reroute plumbing, so our goal was to increase the feeling of space while making it as pretty and useable as possible. Style-wise, we wanted the bathroom to look like it could have been original to the house so we were careful to choose pieces that had an old-fashioned feel to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maximize space, we swapped the existing door for a pocket door and chose a dual-flush toilet with a narrow tank and small footprint. A console sink and clawfoot tub kept things airy and off the floor. Finding reasonably-priced marble floor and subway wall tile at Lowe&#8217;s kept us on budget, as well as sourcing salvage and secondhand materials which helped to cut costs. Finally, we added an exhaust fan/light combo to help cut humidity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24056 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24057 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite holidays, lots of snow days and a few surprises along the way, the renovation process was mostly stress-free. Our contractor did a good job keeping us informed throughout construction, and he always made himself available to answer questions. And because we lived in our house during construction, we were also able to address and correct any miscommunications right away, which helped the project run more smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re thankful to the Sweeten team for pairing us up with the contractor and his team for an excellent first renovation experience! I&#8217;ve already recommended Sweeten to several friends! Sweeten&#8217;s matching service removes a lot of the scariness and uncertainty associated with finding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified contractor</a>. And when we’re finally ready to begin the next project, you can be sure we’ll be contacting them for another great match!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Working with Olga was fun and easy. She has endless amounts of patience and good ideas, and is a very creative problem solver.  I am very grateful to Sweeten for making the connection.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Erica S., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooklyn homeowners Erica, documentary filmmaker, &amp; Spencer, photojournalist, have a few unique things in common — they both travel &amp; document the world for their work, and they both come from families of antique collectors. It seems no wonder that they also share a mutual interest in maps. A little over six years ago, during a long search for their first home, the couple walked into a one-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace to find a giant map covering an entire wall. They took the map as a sign and made the purchase. A few years later, with the arrival of their daughter, Vivienne, the family started considering options for a larger space, and were eyeing the adjacent one-bedroom for an addition. It turned out the neighbors had a similar idea in mind for themselves, but weren’t positioned to do so yet, so they agreed to sell. For help designing their new home, Erica &amp; Spencer posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their project</a> to theSweeten. Architect &amp; tS member <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olga Bakic</a> proved to be the family&#8217;s perfect match — read on to learn about their beautifully renovated home!<span id="more-8943"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9015 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="801" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s original apartment was 900 sqft, and their neighbors&#8217; space (in grey above) was 750. The homeowners&#8217; main objectives in combining the units were to take down the dividing wall (&#8211;the time had come to part with the map), open up their existing galley kitchen, combine their bedroom &amp; bathroom for a master suite, create a wall of built-in bookshelves, and tear out the second kitchen, which they turned into an office with a built-in desktop.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Olga is extremely patient and dedicated, not to mention a wonderful person.  She listened to and accommodated my opinions, but was also honest enough to (in retrospect) save me from some mistakes.  She has a great design sense.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8972 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walking in the front door of the renovated space: here, we have a split view of each of the two original apartments &#8212; the closet on the right is located where the neighbors&#8217; entry hall used to be, and everything to the left of it was originally a part of Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s home. The map-covered wall that separated the 2 apartments used to be right down the center, along the axis of the dining table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8973 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spencer &amp; Erica&#8217;s shared love of travel &amp; antiques is expressed in their eclectic collection of artwork, maps, artifacts &amp; furnishings.  The dining table &amp; chairs are all antique; above the dining set is a mirrored chandelier by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjrhU8yTOmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Ogden</a>, an artisan who collects vintage parts from flea markets, factories &amp; junk yards, and combines them by hand to create beautiful, original pieces. When designing with Olga, the homeowners expressed their interest in adhering to the home&#8217;s existing &#8212; at times quirky &#8212; pre-war style, rather than doing anything too sleek or modern. One of the most prevalent design outcomes of this is the archway openings that were used throughout the new construction to match the old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8975 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A map in the living room caught our eye and makes a wonderful accent to Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s leather Chesterfield sofa, which they picked up at a tag sale in Connecticut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8976 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the sofa, the family can take advantage of their new open kitchen, and admire its charm! Like the dining room chandelier, the pendant lamps are crafted by Robert Ogden, as well as the stools which he produces for his separate line, <a href="https://lostine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lostine</a>. The wooden bartop is custom made of reclaimed pine from <a href="https://ogtstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olde Good Things</a>. Cabinets from the original kitchen were re-used in the new design, and a new backsplash was added in <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Merola-Tile-Lantern-12-1-2-in-x-12-1-2-in-White-Porcelain-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-FKOLB10/202101830#.UcM2PPa17fY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merola Lantern tiles</a>, available at Home Depot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8977 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the master bedroom which features a curated array of vintage furnishings &amp; accessories for a nostalgic, dreamlike space. The antique bed has been Erica&#8217;s since she was a child, but her favorite piece is the star chandelier which belonged to her grandparents. Spencer collects old trunks, so they have a nice, big trunk for the foot of the bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8978 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/08_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/08_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/08_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowners had long wanted a whole wall of bookshelves, so Olga helped them design a built-in unit for their new family room / library. This space could also double as a guest or third bedroom &#8212; a great luxury in the city! Overhead, an antique-inspired pendant from <a href="https://www.rhbabyandchild.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=rhbc_prod389109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a> hangs from the ceiling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8979 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We do not miss the wall &#8211; or the map &#8211; we are thrilled with the space, the layout, the new lifestyle.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Awesome job to Olga for helping to make a new home that is just right for this young, adventurous family &#8212; thanks so much to Erica, Spencer &amp; Vivienne for sharing their unique space!</p>
<p>6/20/2013 UPDATE:</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment, Virginia! It looks like they have a pretty handy vertical bike rack. Will look into the source!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we&#8217;re catching up with another one of our new GC&#8217;s &#8212;<a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a> is a husband-wife team lead by Nick &amp; Dawn Dillon. The homeowners (a pair of young, newly-wed professionals) chose Nick Knacks after interviewing 7 other contractors for this project which included renovating both a master (full) bath and a half bath in their Upper West Side home. Nick has a knack for details, so we&#8217;ve broken down the nitty-gritty on just the master bath makeover.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3502" title="nicknackbefore 2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>The Nick Knacks team did a complete gut of the bathroom space to discover rotted flooring along with old plumbing lines and pipes that would have to be re-routed in order to realize its new design. After re-routing the plumbing where necessary, they upgraded all of the wiring to code, also adding recessed ceiling lights, 2 vanity light fixtures, a silent vent fan, and designated dimmer switches&#8230; Then onto the details below! <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3503" title="nickknacks_01" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Nick always stresses the importance of proper site prep &#8212; for this project, his team spent an entire day protecting surfaces, setting up equipment &amp;  preliminary building materials to create a proper construction zone (which was also 99% dust free!). <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3504" title="nickknacks_02" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Here&#8217;s a first view into the renovated master bath. Nick&#8217;s design featured classic white beveled-edge subway tiles and <a href="https://store.benjaminmoore.com/storefront/shop-by-product/interior-paints/aura-interior-paint/prodPRM24.html?sbcColor=2033_70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Aura Sweet Honeydew Melon</a> on the walls, as well as framed inset medicine cabinets from <a href="https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?link=MedicineCabinets&amp;categoryId=cat1520041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a>, and a new granite top for the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3505" title="nickknacks_03" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>When it came to the bathroom cabinets, Nick worked closely with these homeowners to come up with a custom solution that was &#8220;exactly it.&#8221; Nick did the design, fabrication, installation and wood staining of the double sink base cabinet (above) as well as a floating sink base and vertical storage cabinets in the half bath. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3500" title="nickknacks_04" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Nick&#8217;s eye for details is also found in the finish of the window sill and tub ledge where he matched the granite used on the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3501" title="nickknacks_05" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>He also chose lighting and bath fixtures in polished chrome, including faucet and shower fittings from the <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Collections-Purist/category/430068/430062.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler Purist Collection</a>. The floors and tub side were tiled with these unglazed porcelain in <a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/72620612710977408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linosa by Basaltina</a>.</p>
<p>Nick says that the homeowners were so pleased with the bathrooms that they added a custom bedroom closet to the scope of the original project. Great work and many thanks to Nick &amp; Dawn!</p>
