										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A change of plans results in a home to grow into for the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Melissa and Blake were on the hunt for a two-bedroom apartment in their beloved neighborhood of Gramercy for years with little to no luck. When the search felt hopeless, they readjusted their expectations, setting their sights on large, one-bedroom units that could be renovated to fit their needs. Fortunately, the new angle proved successful, and the couple came across an older co-op with good bones and plenty of windows and storage, providing them with the perfect canvas to shape their new home. Read on for Melissa’s take on their resourceful home renovation!</em></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28650 size-feature" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-936x667.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been looking for a two-bedroom apartment under $1 million for years. We knew that for that price, we&#8217;d need to find a “wreck” and fix it up, but we weren’t willing to compromise on location, lots of windows, air conditioners that were NOT in the window, good closet space, a doorman, an elevator, reasonable maintenance, and as much square footage as we could get. Pretty much impossible. But when we started looking at large one-bedrooms that we could convert to a two-bedroom, we began to see a few possibilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28652" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28781 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FloorPlan-B_A-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we got had everything we wanted except that it had lime-green walls with dark green moldings everywhere (except in the pink bedroom; it had rose-colored moldings), an original ‘50s-style bathroom and kitchen, and a huge closet (3’ deep x 7’ long) added to a wall right as you walked into the apartment.</p>

<blockquote><p>None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any contractors they had used.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started looking for contractors right away to get an idea of cost. None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any they had used. One Sunday morning, we were watching NBC’s &#8220;Open House&#8221; and saw an ad for Sweeten. We did some research online and everyone who used the site seemed really happy with the results. We liked the fact that they did background checks on the contractors and had reviews from other people who had actually used the contractor. There was nothing to lose, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our job</a> to be matched.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We met with three contractors (all responded to us within hours) and learned something from every one of them. We hadn’t thought about the floors (they needed to either be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replaced or refinished</a>), <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doors </a>(they were all hollow and flimsy), or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">electrical wiring</a> (some of the ceiling fixtures were not exactly “legal”). The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one we chose was the last contractor we met with</a> and spent the most time with probably because we knew he was the “one.” We explained what we wanted to do and he responded with what was possible, what was necessary, what choices we had to save money, and what we would regret not doing. He took our “vision” for the kitchen and prepared plans that we all reworked until they were right. Our list got longer and our budget got larger, but thanks to his experience, we felt confident the right choices were being made. He also has a kitchen and bath showroom, where we picked out most of our materials with considerable help and advice from him and his office administrator Dede.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28643 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28646" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-15" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At our closing, we had all the materials needed for the co-op board’s renovation package done and ready to be filed. Our contractor had a lot of experience renovating NYC co-ops and knew all the insurance, licensing, and millions of details that are involved with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">board submissions</a>. His office administrator was on top of everything and made that part of the process a breeze. There was some back and forth with the co-op manager and their architects approving the job—July and August may not have been the best time to get approvals when the world is on vacation!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28642 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Before shots of the front door and closet (l.) and kitchen (r.)<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28898 mt-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt02-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally started at the end of August and moved in the first week of November, although the guys didn’t completely finish until mid-November. Our contractor’s crew, run by his brother Benny, were all such great guys. They were at the site every day, all day, working hard, so progress was easy to see. They never left without cleaning and mopping. They were very considerate of our neighbors throughout the renovation. Our new building super stopped by from time to time to check on the work and told us he was impressed with the quality of their efforts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28649 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-10" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28648" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we love about our new apartment is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan</a> that resulted from tearing out the big closet and the walls surrounding the kitchen and connecting the kitchen to the living room. The whole place is brighter now with the light from the kitchen window. We have so much more space with a bar and stools and lots of cabinets. The tile backsplash, counters, and floors are different textures and work really well with the white cabinets, decisions we made with lots of advice from our contractor! We opted to do some things ourselves. We bought closet interiors for the bedroom and front hall closets from Ikea, put them together, and our contractor bolted them into the wall. We purchased custom radiator covers online and assembled them ourselves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28653 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28896" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt07.gif" alt="SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space is still a one-bedroom for now, but it’s designed in such a way that if we need an extra bedroom in the future, we can easily add a wall to the end of the L-shaped living space (which already has its own closet, too). The Ikea <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bedroom closet</a> was a big investment of time that totally paid off. It&#8217;s 11 feet of closet with hanging space, drawers, and interior lights. The three huge sliding doors let us keep it two-thirds open at any one time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28656 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28655" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom has a frameless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass tub enclosure</a>, letting in lots of light. Our contractor helped us choose the tiles and recommended the new silver edging, which looks great, as well as the wood-like tile for the floor. We found our bathroom vanity on sale and we ended up with a free bathtub! The tub we ordered was delivered and installed, but the protective paper-surround stayed on until the bathroom was finished. When the paper came off, we saw they had sent the wrong tub. Since it was already installed, the company gave us the only remedy left—a free tub!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Client services at Sweeten checked in with us periodically throughout the whole renovation and were available by phone when we needed them. When the job was finished, we submitted a review of our contractor that we hope helps other people trying to decide on their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, our “wreck” became a beautiful, bright, modern home where we like to cook together and have friends over, and we feel very comfortable here.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17601 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hari and Kaity certainly did their homework when it came to collecting interior design inspiration and research. Perusing Pinterest and just about every architecturally-focused gallery out there, they pooled ideas and thought about renovations that had taken place in a neighboring apartment. They both loved the look of NYC’s quintessential pre-war buildings but also wanted to leave some room for more modern finishes. While the couple’s original </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was mainly focused on upgrading their kitchen, their renovation evolved with the help of their </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his team, as it began to make sense to take on work in other rooms while they were all at it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apartment’s floors had lost their luster, the living room was a blank slate, and the bedroom closet was clearly not cut out for a couple. Their contractor got to work, devising a plan to deliver smart upgrades in those high-impact places.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17503 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamal and his team sanded and stained the wood floors, bringing a rich depth and gleam to the wood planks that would serve as the basis for transformation in the living room and bedroom. Hari and Kaity initially pictured adding wainscot paneling to their living room and hallway, but after much debate decided it would be wasted once hidden behind furniture, so they opted for a series of decorative picture frame moldings instead. The simple addition was a low-cost and non-invasive way to give dimension to the boxy living room, and helps play up the shape of the apartment’s lovely window. They also decided to do away with ceiling fans, adding a glamorous tiered West Elm chandelier. This before and after is a testament to how refinished flooring, fresh paint, and luminous lighting choices can be enough to completely change a home!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, the bedroom and its limited closet space. Square footage in the bedroom left plenty of room for furniture, but the single closet was not a long-term option. Their Sweeten contractor set his sights on the bedroom’s far wall, seeing just enough room to create closets out of thin air without cutting off access to the bedroom window.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He built out two full-size closet structures, filled the interiors with Kaity’s vision for custom shelving and storage, and finished the additions with detailed paneling on the new closet doors. Hari and Kaity replaced all of the silver lever door handles throughout the home with brushed black knobs—another simple upgrade with striking effect. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what to do with the old bedroom closet? Because the original closet was so close to the bedroom’s entryway, an open office nook was a smarter use of space. The sliding doors were removed and a cozy little studious retreat fell into place. </span></p>
