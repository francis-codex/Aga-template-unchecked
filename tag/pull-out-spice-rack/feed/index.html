										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A developer&#8217;s dark style is transformed by its new owner with high-gloss cabinets, drawers turned sideways, and a comfy window seat</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="window seat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait-723x1085.jpg" alt="window seat" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesign a kitchen</a> with a bright sheen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: There was much to love about the two-bedroom condo in Bed-Stuy that Ursula, a math teacher, recently purchased. The developer, who had just converted a brownstone into four apartments, did a good job. However, the brand new kitchen just wasn’t her style. The dark mahogany cabinets and kitchen island weighed it down as did the floorboards of a similar color. The cabinets above the range also gave the space a claustrophobic feel. “The developer seemed to have an imagination when it came to painting. The walls were blue and yellow and very specific to his taste,” said Ursula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: Since her new apartment only has windows on the front and back, Ursula used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to </span>tap her Sweeten contractor and harness that light. So out went the dark cabinets. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood floors</a> were stripped and restained. To open up the kitchen, the cabinets and microwave above the range were out, too (“it just isn’t a pretty appliance,” said Ursula, speaking of microwaves). In their place is now a sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a>. With the space more open, the hexagonal tiles chosen for the backsplash became a focal point. “I think it must be the math teacher in me, but there is just something about them that I love,” she said. A &#8220;dresser&#8221;-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a> features three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and some pots and pans. &#8220;My beech cutting board is always on top of the kitchen island for food prep,&#8221; says Ursula. &#8220;It is conveniently in front of the oven, so I just have to turn around to cook.&#8221; The storage unit&#8217;s glossy gray tone offers contrast to the mostly white space. Her Sweeten contractor also utilized every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinet space</a> including a stubborn area next to the oven. There, a drawer installed on its side—a cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit—became a convenient <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull-out spice rack</a>. As for the microwave, a much smaller one is hidden in the upper cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Ursula&#8217;s Sweeten contractor used the same kitchen cabinet system from Ikea to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bench seat</a> near the window. Now, there’s more storage space and extra seating for when guests come over. “That&#8217;s one of my favorite areas in the apartment because it is a little unexpected,” she says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Style finds</b></span>: Backsplash tiles: <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">Nemo Tile</span></a><span class="s3">.</span></span> <span class="s1"> Cabinetry and island from Ringhult line; hood: <span class="s3"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ikea</a>.</span> Cabinet hardware: <a href="https://www.thehardwarehut.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">Hardware Hut</span></a>.

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23735 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-723x482.jpg" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re like most cooks, you have a medley of spice containers in your kitchen, including some duplicates because it&#8217;s easy to forget what you already own when out food shopping. Spice storage is becoming a frequent request</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">wall niches or built-in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a>—to <span class="s1">house these valuable ingredients. Those renovating have a prime opportunity to factor this into planning their kitchen layouts because </span>the last thing you want to do is fumble around for the paprika with a hot pan on the stove. To kick your spice game up a notch, here are 5 creative ideas from Sweeten homeowners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23716 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio and Melina&#8217;s</a> renovated kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After dealing with past kitchens that lacked storage, Fabio and Melina wanted their new kitchen to have plenty of it, especially since they both love to cook. Concealed pantry storage was built around the fridge and a pull-out drawer was added for storing spices. The spice drawer lives inside the upper lip of a much deeper drawer filled with baking essentials, maximizing the storage potential of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23717 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Open shelving in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen, once small and cramped, needed to fit two cooks working side by side. The old kitchen was filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, a design dilemma that would be best served by custom cabinetry. To mix it up, open shelving was added, presenting the perfect solution for storing spices and cookbooks near the stove.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23718 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="Spice rack niche" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/tired-hudson-heights-home-reveals-stylish-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica and David&#8217;s</a> spice storage niche</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jessica and David decided to build a new closet along the wall separating their dining room from the kitchen so that they could use the dining room space as a bedroom in the future. Although the placement of the closet cut a chunk out of the kitchen, they were able to take back some of the lost space by carving out a niche with plenty of shelves for storing spices. As a bonus, the convenient storage also makes it easy for them to keep track of what they have in stock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack custom cabinetry" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Custom cabinet in <a href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ketrina&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In building out Ketrina’s formerly tiny kitchen with new custom cabinets, bonus upper and lower units were added to the design to make better use of the space and hide some pipes. One such cabinet placed between the stove and the window was the perfect size to store spices, proving that every inch counts when it comes to boosting storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23723 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="Pull-out spice rack" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Pull-out spice rack in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work-from-home writers Amanda and her husband cook often and wanted a kitchen in which they&#8217;d feel comfortable working in together. With a sizable collection of seasonings, a pull-out spice rack was added next to the stove and cleverly concealed as cabinetry, making it easy for both cooks to have what they need when the recipe calls for it.</p>
