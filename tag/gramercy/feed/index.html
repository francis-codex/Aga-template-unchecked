</ul>
<h3>Empty-nesters decide to renovate</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Charon, a graphic designer, and her husband, Lex, moved to New York City for Lex’s job in aviation services, they knew exactly where to look: Gramercy. “We both had always loved the park and the older brick buildings in the area,” Charon said. With their children moved out, they found the perfect one-bedroom in a co-op building that had the right amount of space and natural light.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Happy homeowner sitting on a yellow chair at the round dining table " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48911" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Opening up the bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the bathroom had recently been renovated, the bathtub felt like it took up too much space. The couple knew they wanted to rip out the unused tub and trade it in for an open shower with a frameless fixed <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass</a> panel. They just needed to find the right contractor for the job. They posted their renovation project to Sweeten and interviewed four general contractors before making their decision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Image of a toilet in green tiled bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48910" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="Image of vintage shower head in green tile shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48909" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Removing the tub</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tub was the first thing to go, and the bathroom immediately looked bigger without it. Charon and Lex wanted to match the original dark green, almost black, wall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile</a> as closely as possible, and found a near-identical style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the new shower installed, the bathroom became much more spacious and light. Charon said the change made the space more efficient for two people. (“It certainly helped my marriage!” she joked.) And little details made a big difference, too, like installing a taller, comfort-height <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> for Lex, who is 6’2,” and attaching the toilet paper holder directly to the glass shower panel. To create a seamless continuation—the new tiles were about 1/16” smaller and had a slightly bluer hue—the contractor’s tile installer decided to add a row of vertical tiles between the old and the replacement tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Image of open concept shower and toilet in renovated bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48907" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A finished product that works</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their advice to new renovators? Charon wholeheartedly recommends Sweeten and the Sweeten contractors: “Sweeten stays involved throughout the whole process and has well-vetted contractors who take care of everything!” She called the process “seamless” and “easy,” but she did have one piece of advice about timing: “Being flexible is helpful.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All in all, the couple couldn’t be happier. “Our tiny bathroom is so much more workable,” Charon said. “We’re still thrilled every time we walk into the bathroom.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="Image of green subway tile and pedestal sink" width="1000" height="1501" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48908" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Charon-Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The contractor’s tile installer was such a master that he only had five subway tiles left over after finishing in the bathroom!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A change of plans results in a home to grow into for the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Melissa and Blake were on the hunt for a two-bedroom apartment in their beloved neighborhood of Gramercy for years with little to no luck. When the search felt hopeless, they readjusted their expectations, setting their sights on large, one-bedroom units that could be renovated to fit their needs. Fortunately, the new angle proved successful, and the couple came across an older co-op with good bones and plenty of windows and storage, providing them with the perfect canvas to shape their new home. Read on for Melissa’s take on their resourceful home renovation!</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28650 size-feature" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-936x667.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been looking for a two-bedroom apartment under $1 million for years. We knew that for that price, we&#8217;d need to find a “wreck” and fix it up, but we weren’t willing to compromise on location, lots of windows, air conditioners that were NOT in the window, good closet space, a doorman, an elevator, reasonable maintenance, and as much square footage as we could get. Pretty much impossible. But when we started looking at large one-bedrooms that we could convert to a two-bedroom, we began to see a few possibilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28652" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28781 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FloorPlan-B_A-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we got had everything we wanted except that it had lime-green walls with dark green moldings everywhere (except in the pink bedroom; it had rose-colored moldings), an original ‘50s-style bathroom and kitchen, and a huge closet (3’ deep x 7’ long) added to a wall right as you walked into the apartment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28897 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28644" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<blockquote><p>None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any contractors they had used.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started looking for contractors right away to get an idea of cost. None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any they had used. One Sunday morning, we were watching NBC’s &#8220;Open House&#8221; and saw an ad for Sweeten. We did some research online and everyone who used the site seemed really happy with the results. We liked the fact that they did background checks on the contractors and had reviews from other people who had actually used the contractor. There was nothing to lose, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our job</a> to be matched.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We met with three contractors (all responded to us within hours) and learned something from every one of them. We hadn’t thought about the floors (they needed to either be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replaced or refinished</a>), <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doors </a>(they were all hollow and flimsy), or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">electrical wiring</a> (some of the ceiling fixtures were not exactly “legal”). The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one we chose was the last contractor we met with</a> and spent the most time with probably because we knew he was the “one.” We explained what we wanted to do and he responded with what was possible, what was necessary, what choices we had to save money, and what we would regret not doing. He took our “vision” for the kitchen and prepared plans that we all reworked until they were right. Our list got longer and our budget got larger, but thanks to his experience, we felt confident the right choices were being made. He also has a kitchen and bath showroom, where we picked out most of our materials with considerable help and advice from him and his office administrator Dede.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28643 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28646" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-15" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At our closing, we had all the materials needed for the co-op board’s renovation package done and ready to be filed. Our contractor had a lot of experience renovating NYC co-ops and knew all the insurance, licensing, and millions of details that are involved with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">board submissions</a>. His office administrator was on top of everything and made that part of the process a breeze. There was some back and forth with the co-op manager and their architects approving the job—July and August may not have been the best time to get approvals when the world is on vacation!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28642 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Before shots of the front door and closet (l.) and kitchen (r.)<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28898 mt-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt02-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally started at the end of August and moved in the first week of November, although the guys didn’t completely finish until mid-November. Our contractor’s crew, run by his brother Benny, were all such great guys. They were at the site every day, all day, working hard, so progress was easy to see. They never left without cleaning and mopping. They were very considerate of our neighbors throughout the renovation. Our new building super stopped by from time to time to check on the work and told us he was impressed with the quality of their efforts.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What we love about our new apartment is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan</a> that resulted from tearing out the big closet and the walls surrounding the kitchen and connecting the kitchen to the living room. The whole place is brighter now with the light from the kitchen window. We have so much more space with a bar and stools and lots of cabinets. The tile backsplash, counters, and floors are different textures and work really well with the white cabinets, decisions we made with lots of advice from our contractor! We opted to do some things ourselves. We bought closet interiors for the bedroom and front hall closets from Ikea, put them together, and our contractor bolted them into the wall. We purchased custom radiator covers online and assembled them ourselves.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The space is still a one-bedroom for now, but it’s designed in such a way that if we need an extra bedroom in the future, we can easily add a wall to the end of the L-shaped living space (which already has its own closet, too). The Ikea <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bedroom closet</a> was a big investment of time that totally paid off. It&#8217;s 11 feet of closet with hanging space, drawers, and interior lights. The three huge sliding doors let us keep it two-thirds open at any one time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom has a frameless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass tub enclosure</a>, letting in lots of light. Our contractor helped us choose the tiles and recommended the new silver edging, which looks great, as well as the wood-like tile for the floor. We found our bathroom vanity on sale and we ended up with a free bathtub! The tub we ordered was delivered and installed, but the protective paper-surround stayed on until the bathroom was finished. When the paper came off, we saw they had sent the wrong tub. Since it was already installed, the company gave us the only remedy left—a free tub!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Client services at Sweeten checked in with us periodically throughout the whole renovation and were available by phone when we needed them. When the job was finished, we submitted a review of our contractor that we hope helps other people trying to decide on their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, our “wreck” became a beautiful, bright, modern home where we like to cook together and have friends over, and we feel very comfortable here.</p>
