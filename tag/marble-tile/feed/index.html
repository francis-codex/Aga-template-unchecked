<h3>Before: Give a Gramercy bathroom a much-needed facelift for storage, style</h3>
<p>Dated tile (“the bathroom looked like a 1980s Mafia movie!”) and no storage (“with a pedestal sink and no drawers or shelving, we didn&#8217;t even have room to store extra toilet paper”) drove homeowners Jessica and Kevin to finally renovate their bathroom. She’d been living in the 750-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op overlooking Pete&#8217;s Tavern, the oldest tavern in NYC, for seven years. Renovating the bathroom had been on her remodeling bucket list since day one.</p>

<p>After getting married, they used wedding money to fund their renovation, enthusiastic to update the aesthetics by losing the “burnt-red marble, gold hardware, and wall-to-wall mirrors” and adding storage solutions. Jessica <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: A dramatic change resulted when white modern tile replaced the “heinous red marble tile” Jessica still has nightmares about. Their bathroom, which was trapped in an ‘80s vibe, became a calming, minimal space aligned with the couple’s style. The white and pale gray palette lent the former bathroom new life with a spa feel.</p>
<p>The couple replaced the “clunky” bathtub with a modern shower with two heads and switched to chrome fixtures. Next, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackled their storage woes</a>. A console sink with open shelving for towels gave an airy illusion and contributed to the room feeling more spacious.</p>
<p>While designing their new bath space, Jessica was mindful of potential future buyers. She said, “When I bought the apartment, I found it very frustrating there were so many permanent fixtures, including a built-in glass shelf over the toilet, wall-to-wall mirrors, and tile covering most of the walls.&#8221; To give the next homeowners the room to express their own personal touch, she kept the walls painted instead of tiled, installed a mirror that could easily be replaced over the vanity table, and hung two simple towel hooks.</p>

<p>Jessica offered this sage advice, ”If you are purchasing your own materials for the renovation, have it arrive before the start date.” This will help <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid waiting for products to arrive</a> and delaying the project.</p>
<p>Now Jessica calls her new bathroom a happy place and is appreciative of her well-matched contractor. “As with any NYC renovation, you tend to get a lot of complaints about uncontrollable things like dust and loud noise which comes with the territory of living in an apartment building. My Sweeten contractor handled everything like a pro and had much more patience for people than I ever could have exhibited,” she said. “He was extremely flexible and true to his word with regards <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to price and timing of the project</a>.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jessica <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doubled their storage</a> by adding a two-drawer unit under the existing vanity table as well as a cabinet, creating a “personal heaven” she uses every morning to get ready for work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple creates their dream home with walnut wood floors, a spa bath, and enough kitchen storage to turn heads</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A year-long search—involving a specially-written code!—led Jonathan, a consultant, and Cecilia, a social media strategist and <a href="https://cecibeautytherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">beauty blogger</span></a>, to a mid-century co-op apartment in Queens. The unit was in a serious state of disrepair, with cracked doors and windows and a dangerously unstable kitchen countertop. Read about how the couple changed the floor plan, turned a powder room into a full spa bath, and created a space to suit their lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Prior to moving in together, Jonathan and his girlfriend, Cecilia, were each living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. The criteria for their search? He wanted a large space and a fixer upper with a good school district; she wanted the convenience of a supermarket, shops, and a subway stop close by. Their budget had them looking in Windsor Terrace, Forest Hills, Sunnyside, and Hamilton Heights, in addition to Elmhurst. For their search, Jonathan used his background in quantitative finance to adapt code that he had written to find his first apartment in 2008, which scoured the major real estate websites for properties that fit their fairly strict criteria and price range. The code took into account various factors, such as home value increase over time, new developments, transit efficiency, growth in commercial investments, and the neighborhood’s increasing value over five-plus years. When this apartment came up—roughly a year after they started searching—it was way under budget, and the couple pounced on the opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The space was located in a very convenient neighborhood in Elmhurst, with shops and necessities nearby and just a 25-minute subway ride from midtown. They purchased the 1960s-era apartment with the intention to renovate. The reasonable price meant there was enough left over to splurge on the renovations, so they planned to add their own personal touch with high-end finishes. At roughly 1,300 square feet, the 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op was more space than they expected to find, and the layout allowed them to implement some drastic changes to make the space more usable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/before-floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24365 size-chrono" title="before floorplan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/before-floorplan-723x760.jpg" alt="before floorplan" width="723" height="760" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after-floorplan-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24374 size-chrono" title="after floorplan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after-floorplan-1-723x760.jpg" alt="after floorplan" width="723" height="760" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24318 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24319 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and Cecilia could see that the apartment had good bones. Despite the positives, it was extremely outdated and many things—such as the cabinets, heaters, windows, and doors—were falling apart. The kitchen counter would teeter if you placed any weight on it, and would even come off its foundation if you pressed down. The previous owners had done unpermitted renovations in the past, and the apartment had not been well taken care of. The original layout had long narrow halls, closets in weird places, a closed kitchen, and cramped rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Initially, Jonathan looked for contractors on his own, until an architect friend told him about Sweeten. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">He posted his project</span></a> and wrote up his description. He said, “I received a lot of quick responses—more than me going out on my own, and the bids were much more competitive than any from my own research. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor</span></a> that I went with was a one-stop shop for everything. He had an architect, a designer, and a project manager—they pretty much did all the heavy lifting. They were super responsive and took care of a lot of the issues that arose throughout the process. Knowing that they have been vetted through Sweeten definitely gave me peace of mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and his Sweeten contractor set out to solve problems related to space usability and efficiency, and to make the apartment feel more open and modern. They decided that if a wall could be knocked down, they would do it. They turned hallways into closets and closets into open spaces. They also wanted to convert the half bath into a second full bath—Cecilia already claimed the first one, so Jonathan needed one of his own!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24322 size-chrono" title="before kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="before kitchen" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24321 size-chrono" title="during renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="during renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24325 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24324 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Given their preference for clean lines with modern touches, they did not want too much in terms of the built-ins and crown molding. “The kitchen was the part of the renovation we were most excited about. Because Cecilia loves to cook and I like to entertain, we wanted people to naturally gather around the kitchen for good food, good drinks, and good times,” says Jonathan. With dark furniture in the rest of the apartment, they went for white shaker cabinets, gray-white texture on the backsplash and white counters with a bit of speckling for an overall contrasting look. Appliances were stainless steel and marble was installed wherever possible. An incredible amount of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> and counter space was added, with every inch of space maximized.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24327 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24326 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A pull-out spice rack</a> and deep drawers were among the storage solutions they chose. “Having those large drawers for pots and pans with the ability to customize the holders was a must. A floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers made our snacking life that much easier. We decided on open shelving in select areas to make the kitchen feel more open. A pass-through was also created, so a spot on the living room side was used for counter seating. We wanted large appliances to really be the wow factor in our kitchen. I love our five-burner stove—especially the griddle!—and our massive fridge and great dishwasher. Having this generously proportioned kitchen and large-scale appliances has been amazing, especially compared to our previous apartments,” explains Jonathan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24330 size-chrono" title="before bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="before bathroom" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24329 size-chrono" title="during bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-04-723x482.jpg" alt="during bathroom" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24331 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-15-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24332 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original full bath—Cecilia’s bathroom—they went with a white theme. She wanted it to be bright and classy, so they chose glossy white marble <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile for the floors</a> and large-format porcelain tile for the walls, with an accent wall of marble 2-inch subway tile laid in a herringbone pattern. This gave the space more texture and made it feel more custom. They also added a niche for toiletries and bath products.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24333 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24334 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second bath, Jonathan added a large shower by taking some space from the master bedroom closet. “Since it was my bathroom, I had full reign and wanted it to resemble a spa.” The Sweeten contractor added slate tiles throughout, as well as a pebbled shower floor and a large shower panel with rainfall and waterfall features. In both baths, they installed tankless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilets</a> per co-op requirements.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Throughout the apartment, they had originally planned on going with light bamboo flooring. When their Sweeten design/build firm sent over samples of both light and dark wood, however, they fell in love with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark walnut flooring</a> from Triangulo. For the office space, they decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French doors</a> to allow some openness between the living room and office, while providing privacy if needed when Jonathan worked from home in the evenings.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest challenges of the project related to changes to their original design: “A lot of it was due to unforeseen circumstances,&#8221; Jonathan explains. &#8220;The original broker stretched the truth about where pipes were, what construction was done legally, what was underneath the floors, as well as what we would be permitted to do. We originally had a plan that was going to be signed off, but once we contacted the live-in super, problems started to arise. We had to do two to three different drafts, which caused scheduling delays as well as caused friction with the co-op board and staff. The entire process took about two months just to get approval because of these issues. Eventually, we got everything set up, and once construction started, there were only a few slight hiccups. Everything went fairly smoothly.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After finishing the renovation, Jonathan’s recommendation to future renovators is to be open and flexible with the initial vision. “Most people have an idea of how exactly they want things, and are unwilling to do something different or new. That’s good but rarely does your budget or space allow you to have everything that you want. I originally wanted to remove some of our closets because I thought we had too many, but my girlfriend and designer suggested that we keep them for both value and utility. Having lived here for six months, I can safely say that I’m glad we kept the closets.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan feared that the end product wouldn’t match up to his vision. He and Cecilia have very different design aesthetics, and he wasn’t sure if they would mesh well together. “In the end, I think the apartment has a good flow and calming color tones, which is something nice to come home to after a hectic day. Another big question I had was whether we could actually do everything in the timeframe the contractors set out—about four to five months. It was an ambitious schedule, and while there were small items that needed to be addressed after we moved in, they were minor. In the end, we completed the project on deadline, and are very happy with how it turned out.”</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>She decided to renovate instead of move</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>With prices in her Fort Greene co-op building surging upward, film editor Mollie Goldstein faced a dilemma: she could cash out (but deal with the colossal hassle of moving) or remain in a building and neighborhood she loved (albeit in an outdated “starter” studio apartment). Some smart home equity math helped her see that the pros of her current place outweighed the cons, so she came to Sweeten to upgrade (inventively and colorfully!) rather than start again elsewhere.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39994 mb-0 size-full" title="blue kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Fort Greene homeowner Mollie Goldstein</em></p>
<p>About a year ago, I started noticing that prices for apartments in my Fort Greene co-op building had skyrocketed. I live in a studio, so the question of upgrading to a true one-bedroom was always on my mind. It had also been ten years since I bought my 500 square foot “starter apartment,” so I was starting to wonder if it might be time for a more “grown-up” dwelling. In short: Was now the time to cash out and buy something bigger elsewhere?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration, though, I realized that 1) I love my building, 2) I love my neighborhood, and 3) my apartment is the exact right size for one person and one dog. The increasing market value, however, meant that I had equity I could borrow against, and so I decided to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and make myself a new apartment without having to uproot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39988 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39989 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" alt="bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That decision turned out to be the easy part. When it came to planning a renovation—or even finding someone to help me plan a renovation—I had no idea what I was doing and no clue how to get started. After some time on the Internet, I thought a design/build firm might make the most sense for me, since I had no confidence in my ability to either design a proper space or supervise a contractor. But when I talked to the reps for several Manhattan firms, they laughed at my budget and sent me packing. Google eventually led me to Sweeten, where I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>. The kind staff there double-checked my budget, but at least they didn’t laugh—and neither did the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> I was eventually paired up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was amazing, and I felt an instant rapport with her. I’d had no experience in construction, but I do collaborate for a living (I’m a film editor), and I immediately recognized that she was a gem. The design process was so much fun. Because I was renovating in order to stay put, I wanted to design spaces purely for myself. Both rooms had always been serviceable, but the hasty repairs made before I moved in ten years earlier were showing their age, and I knew there had to be better ways to take advantage of the space I had available (especially in the surprisingly large-for-NYC kitchen). It drove me crazy that the kitchen cabinets didn&#8217;t reach the ceiling (so much wasted space!) and I hated stacking my spices on top of the stove. I also had a random hole in my kitchen wall where a neighbor&#8217;s contractor had drilled through and then disappeared. The bathroom was grungy in its off-white color scheme and constantly sprouting various leaks and cracks. I also love pattern and color, and I knew I wanted to create a personalized kitchen and something other than a standard white bathroom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen design came together very quickly. I gave my contractor a few wallpaper swatches and a random list of priorities: I wanted a dishwasher, but it had to be less obtrusive than the current model; I needed a place for cookbooks; I was desperate for more storage; and could she please include a cute little spice drawer? Within a few days she sent me a rendering that was very similar to the final product. The Hygge &amp; West wallpaper (which I’d had my eye on for a while), set the tone for our color scheme and she designed a clever built-in with a hidden-drawer dishwasher by Fisher &amp; Paykel that I loved right away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic layout of the bathroom was pretty easy, too, but we struggled a little more with the design. I knew I wanted something special, but I didn’t exactly know what it was. I sent my contractor a list of tiles I liked, none of which were appropriate, but she looked at them all and distilled the essence of what I was looking for, sending back the chevron marble from TileBar that we eventually went with around the tub (with its hexagon cousin for the floor). And as it happened, one of those other rejected bathroom tiles ended up as the kitchen floor — when we were looking at all our samples together, I slid that Bestile Moderna sample over to the kitchen pile, and, while neither of us had seen it coming, we both loved the black &amp; white pattern against the blue cabinetry. The floor has since become one of my absolute favorite things about the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to my contactor and her team, construction went pretty smoothly (for me). I moved out for five weeks while they dealt with all the problems of a crumbling kitchen ceiling, hauling debris out through a co-op lobby, and having to send back tile that arrived scratched. I’m sure there were a hundred other stumbling blocks that I never heard about, and I remain deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with trustworthy contractors whose standards were even higher than I expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Maggie (my dog) and I have moved back in, I’m in love with my new space. Showering in my beautiful marble shower every morning is a treat, and I cook much more—and much more enjoyably—now that I have all the counter space I need. Both the kitchen and the bathroom are neater and less cluttered than ever before now that there is a place to put everything. I’m incredibly happy that I took the renovation plunge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This week, we have a full bathroom renovation guest report in from Celeste G., a condo owner and marketing, brand building, and copywriting triple threat in Park Slope. Read on down for Celeste’s debrief on her Brooklyn bathroom before and after!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14659 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg" alt="celeste park slope bathroom" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Homeowner guest post by Celeste G., Park Slope homeowner<span id="more-14416"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I purchased my one bedroom condo in Park Slope in 2008. It was new construction, which was great because I am the exact opposite of handy or DIY. The “design” of the apartment was standard for new construction buildings at the time: bamboo floors, limestone tile, and dark cherry cabinetry. I lived in the apartment for a few years before considering any cosmetic changes and around year three, I noticed that the limestone tiles in my bathroom had darkened in some spots. In fact, the tile had never been sealed and as I learned the hard way, limestone is extremely porous. Several failed cleaning experiments later, I had nearly ruined the color and texture of a small patch near the sink vanity. As a clean enthusiast, the sight of the floor drove me bananas, but I wasn’t ready to take on what felt like an overwhelming renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-01" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, I decided to replace all the bamboo floors in my apartment (why start small when practically moving out of your home is an option?!). Luckily this foray into renovation was successful and the change in flooring literally changed the entire look and feel of the whole place. I felt confident tackling my tiny bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did some research on what I might spend (why are toilets so expensive???) and asked my friends for contractor recommendations. My building required contractors with a certain amount of insurance, so I started looking beyond friend recommendations and luckily landed on Sweeten. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a> and was matched with three contractors including <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a>. All I knew for sure was that I liked the idea of a gray/black/white graphical floor, and I definitely needed more storage space because clutter makes my eyes swim &#8212; during our first meeting, I felt that Paulina understood the general aesthetic I was interested in and suggested a number of possibilities to open up the small-ish space. I sent her a few pictures from Pinterest and she developed 3D models based on my bathroom’s measurements. For someone spatially challenged, the modeling was enormously helpful. I could see the transformation and make adjustments before touching a thing. For example, we initially thought gold hardware would elevate the bathroom’s overall look but once I saw it in the model, I opted to go with chrome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we were decided on the 3D model, Paulina sourced floor and wall samples and sent me a photo of the type of wood planned for a custom vanity. I presented a lot of options to her and relied on her expertise for guidance. For example, a friend of mine replaced her bathroom sinks with <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corian surfaces</a> and I really liked the seamlessness of it. I shared a photo with Paulina and she designed the sink and vanity with a beautiful, white Corian top, complete with side cutouts to add some dimension and visual interest. Honestly, I was unsure about the cutouts initially but after seeing it in the 3D model, I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14447" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-01" width="600" height="890" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14448" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main challenge with this bathroom was the lack of storage space. I asked Paulina for a deep medicine cabinet along with a good amount of storage space in the vanity. I got my wish in spades. As we were discussing options, I pointed out that there was no place for a trash bin. Paulina worked it into the design of the vanity so not only do I have space for a small trash bin, it’s also completely hidden from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original inspiration for the renovation was again, the floor. I fell in love with a cement tile in a M.C. Escher-like pattern. Paulina ordered samples for us to review but expressed some second thoughts about the durability and appearance of that tile. Maybe two or three days later, she emailed me to say that she was concerned about this particular pick and suggested I look at some marble tile with a similar pattern at a showroom nearby. I’m so glad I took her up on it. The marble option, from <a href="https://www.walkerzanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walker Zanger</a> (in Facet Ash), was not only more in line with the aesthetic I wanted but also less expensive and more durable. I kept my original tub and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Bathroom-Toilets/category/429984/429204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler toilet</a>, and framed the room in a new beveled, white subway tile. I kept the walls white and Paulina’s team installed a <a href="https://www.minkagroup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minka-Lavery Downtown Edison lighting fixture</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14449" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The two weeks of actual renovation are a blur to me now. They seemed to go by very quickly and yet take forever. I was close enough to check on progress every day and Paulina’s team really did work fast. The transformation was fun to watch, even though I admittedly had a few panicked moments and doubts about the chair rail tile (why do I even know what this is?) and the vanity. I remember one email I sent Paulina after the vanity was installed. I spent maybe 10-15 minutes in the bathroom while it was still under construction trying to get the drawers to the vanity open, and then emailed to ask if the drawers would be easier to open when the bathroom was finished. It didn’t occur to me that the pulls hadn’t been installed yet. Thankfully, Paulina has a good sense of humor…!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few months later and I still love my new bathroom. When I think back to that stained limestone tile and cherry wood vanity, I can’t believe it took me seven years to switch it up.</p>
