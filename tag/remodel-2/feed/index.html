			<h2>The duo loves nothing more than making their clients&#8217; vision come to life!</h2>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: I’m from the country of Georgia and I’ve been in construction ever since Ilya started our business.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I was born in Russia, grew up in Australia, and finally settled in New York City in my early 20s. I&#8217;ve been in the construction business professionally for 12 years. As a teenager, I used to work on construction sites almost every summer, and that is really where I developed a love of building.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into this industry?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: When Ilya started our business 12 years ago, he always leaned on me for inspiration and advice. Ilya had a construction background, while mine was in marketing and advertising. He’s the expert contractor and I manage the back end of the business along with communications, marketing, and social media. If you see a smiley face in one of our emails, I probably wrote it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I have always been interested in things that allowed me to be creative. Even as a kid, I was a Lego’s master! I went through culinary school in Australia, then jewelry school in New York City. I worked as a master jeweler, which is so similar to construction and building—only on a much smaller scale. Ultimately I decided to pursue my passion for construction and building.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: I’m a big people pleaser, and I love nothing more than knowing that our clients are truly happy with the home that we helped them design, build, and personalize.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I love the process of being able to help take someone’s vision and turn it into a reality for them. When I see the look on their faces when they walk into their finished home, it makes the hard work all the worthwhile. No two projects are ever alike which always leaves plenty of room for renewed creativity!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35917 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Definitely all the red tape that comes with the management companies and co-op boards. I’m the lucky one that gets to deal with all of that!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya:</span> The biggest challenge—besides traffic and parking—is navigating all the different management companies, co-op boards, building codes, and permit regulations. These processes are a lot harder than they really need to be, but we always work hand-in-hand with everyone involved to ensure we have all the requirements going into the project so there are no delays along the way.</p>
<p><strong> What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Renovating is expensive and not as simple as shown on television! There can and usually will be surprises along the way, so it’s always good to pad your budget by 10%, just in case.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: Pricing and budgets. So many folks don’t understand how expensive renovating in NYC can be! And while Pinterest can provide some amazing inspiration, their budgets oftentimes can’t support those ideas.  But that’s where our creativity kicks into full gear and we get to suggest amazing alternatives and more affordable options for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: The Chrysler Building—it’s gorgeous!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: My favorite modern building is the IAC building right across from Chelsea Piers, but my favorite classic NYC building is the Chrysler building.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Brooklyn Heights, especially the boardwalk with the view of the Manhattan skyline. It takes my breath away every time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: Soho! It has the best mix of modern and classic architecture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-island-separator-blue-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48144 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg" alt="white island separator in a kitchen with blue cabinets and white countertop space along with blue wallpaper and open white shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-brick-wall-narrow-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48148 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg" alt="light brick wall in a narrow living room with plush gray and blue furniture and open metal shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nine million New Jerseyans live in the Garden State. And why not? There’s the option to live close to beaches, own a farm, or live the quintessential American suburban life. There’s also a convenient commute to New York City and Pennsylvania. </span><span class="s1">According to the US Census, 64 percent of the houses are owned by the inhabitants, which means there are a lot of homes available for renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Set a budget for New Jersey home renovation costs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re embarking on a home renovation, your first stop will be creating a realistic budget so you can compare what you have to spend and what you might need to spend to get what you want. Each project will have a unique process and outcome with many variables that will increase or decrease costs. From your tastes in material and workmanship to changes in layout, many elements will impact your budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, </span><span class="s1">Sweeten has done some of the homework for you when it comes to home renovation costs for New Jersey. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs in New Jersey, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value report</span></a>. Renovators in denser areas closer to New York City will likely see slightly higher budgets. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Full home renovation: <b>$100 per square foot (psf) and up</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen remodel: <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen remodel: <b>starting at $30,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$60,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom remodel: <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom remodel: <b>$685 psf</b> or <b>$24,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Basement remodel: starting at <b>$20,000</b><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But remember this: While it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey is a big state. In the northeastern part of the state, real estate prices are slightly lower than neighboring New York City. Western NJ has more affordable rural properties that give New Jersey the nickname “Garden State” for its extensive agricultural industry. The same cost variations can occur when it comes to renovating your New Jersey home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most Sweeten projects generally start at<b> $100 per square foot</b> <b>(psf)</b> in New Jersey. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Norm</a>, who is based in Northern New Jersey, has seen gut renovations start at <b>$200 psf</b> and go up from there. This cost range also includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h4>Easier logistics in New Jersey</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are fewer obstacles to a New Jersey renovation than, say, a place like New York City, according to Norm. For example, New Jersey renovations don&#8217;t normally have parking and access issues or limited hours a co-op will allow for daily construction. This can mean more efficient use of time, less hassle, and a smaller budget for clients in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">House renovations can be lighter on the wallet, too. Houses typically have the upside of direct access, while apartments do not. In apartments, contractors must take extra care (and time) to keep communal hallways and lobbies clean and clear. “All those things make a home renovation much less labor-intensive than an apartment,” said Norm.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<h5>Lower-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor</span><span class="s1"> had completed a kitchen in Monmouth County’s Fair Haven for under <b>$25,000</b> at <b>$100 </b>psf. For flooring, he used a prefinished engineered floor lumber core with a real wood veneer on the top layer. This cost <b>$2,500</b>. The cabinets were purchased ready to install and a stone counter was paired with a stainless steel undermount sink, which was quite cost-effective. A good budget number per square foot of floor space would be <b>$100</b> to <b>$150 psf</b> for economical kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua, a Sweeten contractor</a></span><span class="s1"> who does a lot of renovations in Monmouth and Ocean counties, recently redid a 160-square-foot kitchen for under <b>$20,000</b>. To stick within this economical budget, he used vinyl plank flooring, a basic subway tile backsplash, and premade cabinets that come in standard measurement options like 12, 15, and 21 inches. “You can make it pretty close with those measurements, but with custom, you can make it fit exactly to what the space is,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor agreed that a kitchen renovation can start at under <b>$20,000</b> for something basic (premade stock cabinets, basic appliances, etc.) and small (10’ x 10’ square feet).</span></p>
<h5>Mid to high-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen: Sweeten has seen mid-range kitchens start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. Joshua puts a mid-range kitchen in a range up to<b> $40,000</b>. Instead of hitting up big-box stores like Home Depot, as you would for a lower-end kitchen, this price bracket allows you to shop in specialty stores for items like tiles or cabinets, Joshua said. <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a> puts a typical mid-range kitchen renovation at <b>$375 psf</b> or <b>$75,000</b> total as an average for Trenton, New Jersey’s capital.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen: Sweeten’s typical remodel starts at <strong>$60,000</strong>. The average cost for this level in Trenton, New Jersey, is <b>$145,000</b> or <b>$725 psf</b>, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <span class="s2">report</span>. </span>The largest kitchen project Norm completed in New Jersey was more than <b>$150,000</b>. Pumping up the price were items such as a kitchen island with double-thick quartz and a waterfall edge, a Wolf range, reclaimed wood beams added to the ceiling, a wine fridge, and a very large square footage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations can cost less if the majority of materials come from big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot for porcelain tiles, a molded sink, and a fiberglass shower. “The crux of the job is always similar in terms of what you have—a toilet, a shower, tiles, vanities—then you expand your budget with what finishes you use,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom: A mid-range bathroom that covers about 35 square feet in New Jersey will cost on average <b>$24,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. This comes out at <b>$685 psf</b> and can include a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub. Typically, the smaller the space, the higher the square foot cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom: Sweeten has seen high-end bathrooms start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. That same Cost Vs. Value report puts a high-end bathroom renovation at <b>$75,000</b>, based on a bathroom expanded from 35 square feet to 100 square feet (or <b>$750 psf</b>).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The budget of a recent bathroom that Norm worked on came to that<strong> $75,000</strong> average. “It had it all—an oversized, walk-in steam shower with body sprays and frameless glass,” he said. Additionally, it had custom carpentry and a freestanding tub, “which are very expensive,” Norm added. Then, there is the less exciting but very important work of replacing the plumbing lines. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a basement remodel in the New Jersey area, expect the starting cost to begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report puts an average basement conversion in New Jersey at <b>$117 psf</b>. The example project cost <b>$75,000</b> and was 20’ x 30’ with a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a lot to take into account that will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper to raise the ceiling height. The walls could require underpinning. Electricity and plumbing might need to be installed if there is no existing bathroom. Installation and waterproofing can be significantly costly if it is needed, as well as pumps to drain out water. Some clients just want new drywall, new doors, a new closet, and fresh paint, which could put a project near <b>$20,000.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A premium basement could cost between <b>$100,000</b> and <b>$150,000</b>, according to Sweeten contractor Norm. Clients tend to get creative with basements, from custom bar areas to cinema-style entertainment rooms. “I’ve done a lot that are geared towards homeschooling with learning nooks built underneath stairs,” he said. “Or there’s been funky, retro-style laundries with dropdown racks that fall out of the walls.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there’s a lot of good news for New Jersey renovators when it comes to permits! A few years ago, the state eliminated the need for projects to get a permit for minor work. For example, a bathroom renovation in which fixtures are being directly replaced (often referred to as “rip-and-replace”). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Doing direct replacement — replacing the toilet or oven, old for new — will keep your costs down,” said Norm. This means plumbing and gas lines can stay as is, which can be a huge expense saver. However, for trickier renovations requiring permits, some Sweeten contractors suggest budgeting 10-15 percent of the entire project’s cost for permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New Jersey, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In the township of <span class="s2">Teaneck</span> in Bergen County, the first <b>$50,000</b> in your renovation or repair budget will cost <b>$30</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for permits (so permits for that <b>$20,000</b> kitchen you’re planning will be about <b>$600</b>). The next <b>$50,000</b> in a budget will cost <b>$24</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work and any amount over <b>$100,000</b> will cost <b>$22</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In <a href="https://www.morristwp.com/DocumentCenter/View/4041/Construction-Code-Fees?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Morris Township</span></a>, a permit will cost <b>$33—$44</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the first <b>$50,000</b> of the renovation budget and <b>$27—$33</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the next <b>$50,000</b> and <b>$20—$28</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for a project over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">For <a href="https://ecode360.com/12008181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Toms River</span></a> in Ocean County, the fee will be <b>$39</b> per<b> $50,000</b> of the estimated cost of work, add <b>$25</b> for projects budgeted from <b>$50,001—$100,000</b> and add <b>$19</b> for projects costing over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A remodel invigorates a tired layout for a Manhattan family</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura and Randy almost walked away from the Upper East Side co-op that they would live in with their daughter, Morgan, but a second look changed their minds. Everything had felt cramped—the kitchen, the hallways, even the unit&#8217;s five closets—but in a fit of inspiration, they discovered that the apartment had potential. They turned to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a>, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a general contractor</a> they felt was the right fit for them. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come see how they opened their kitchen to include a built-in desk niche, created seven closets, and enlarged a foyer with a wallpaper-covered ceiling.</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had been living in a Junior 4 (bedroom, kitchen, living room, convertible dining area) that we rented since our daughter was born. We thought we’d live in the apartment for a few years but ended up staying for 10 years. By that point, we had completely outgrown the space, including the dining room converted into a bedroom for our daughter and a dated and closed-off kitchen. It lacked a second full bathroom and closet space, too. Ultimately, we needed a space that felt like ours.</span></p>

Among our list of must-haves: quiet, two bedrooms, two baths, a kitchen that could be opened up, closet space, a nice building, and great natural light. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we first saw our apartment in May, we only had 15 minutes to go through it, and while I thought it could work better than any we&#8217;d seen before (thanks to the amazing natural light and rare east/west exposure), there were some things we’d need to change. My husband felt it wasn&#8217;t going to fit our needs. Even though it was a 1,250-square-foot apartment, he thought the kitchen was too tight, that there weren&#8217;t enough closets (only five and most of them on the smaller size), and there was a lack of hallways. He just had an overall sense that the space felt too small.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could understand his point. The previous owner lived in the space by herself and had made the second bedroom a closet. The master bath only had a bathtub, the kitchen was narrow (we wondered if the dishwasher could pull all the way down), and the dining room had large pieces of furniture and built-ins extending from the dining to living room, that made the space feel smaller. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started to look at other co-op apartments in the building with the same floor plan for inspiration and found one that had just undergone a renovation. Based on its layout, I was able to visualize how we could reconfigure the space to add longer hallways, more closets, and a larger kitchen that utilized more of the space. After showing my husband, and revisiting the space a day later, he agreed and we put in an offer. Another family also put in an offer the same day, but ours ended up getting accepted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of our August close, we started to interview contractors to scope out the work based on our budget. We interviewed two contractors from friend and family recommendations and another that my husband found through his online search that led him to Sweeten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a Sweeten contractor</a> who quickly reached out to us. After an on-site meeting with him, we knew this general contractor was the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right match for our project</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We immediately felt excited about his enthusiasm and ideas and worked together to design a floor plan that made sense to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then we went through the long, dreaded wait for permits and the board approval process. It took us through the month of December to get approved so we could proceed with our renovation. During this time, however, we were able to review countless inspiration photos and decide what and how we wanted the space to look and feel.</span></p>

We had two columns that were structural, a steel beam that couldn&#8217;t come down, and an electric panel that could prevent us from building out the kitchen entry wall. We wanted to somehow open the kitchen and add an island, but it just didn&#8217;t seem feasible. So in our initial plan, we would extend the kitchen but keep it enclosed, and then relocate the electric box outside the kitchen so we could add storage and counter space on that entry wall.</p>
<blockquote><p>She had her heart set on a window bench where she could sit and read. We were able to add these and create storage opportunities underneath.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the day before the demo, we decided to forgo a separate dining room space, extend the kitchen, and add an island and bar stools. We would leverage the living space for both the living and dining rooms and the island would be a focal point tying both rooms together. This would allow an open concept space for meals and entertaining.</span></p>

We created 40+ cabinets for storage, including a sponge pull-down drawer, two pantry closets, spice racks, and tons of drawers, including for knives and one to fit large silverware. This is probably our favorite room.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We knew we wanted to extend the entryway as it was incredibly narrow with two closets on either side of the front door. We decided to keep the larger walk-in and remove the smaller one and create a place that was pretty but also functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we were removing an entry closet that meant we only had four closets; we needed to solve for this. In the master bedroom, we extended our room into the hallway to enlarge the one small closet that was there and then by closing another space (and relocating the master bath door) build a second walk-in closet. A hallway closet that paralleled another closet was extended both of which would hold linens and utility items.</span></p>

Then by adding a new double door closet, we were able to give her two additional closets and eliminate the need for a dresser. She also had her heart set on a window bench where she could sit and read. We were able to add these and create storage opportunities underneath.  We now had seven decent-sized closets in the home which suited our storage needs much better.</span></p>

A large medicine cabinet and a vanity with four drawers that fit around the pipes provided more storage. As a splurge, we added a towel warmer.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demo started just after the new year and lasted through mid-April. During the project, we tried to be quick and diligent about making decisions, allowing us to complete the renovation close to on schedule. Working with our Sweeten contractor was great and we were able to add some fun design elements that kept with the style including wallpaper in three places and a mirrored barn door for a master closet door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we’ve moved in, we worked with a decorator on the finishing touches including rugs, lighting, and artwork and have made our new space really feel like home. We’ve now settled in and couldn&#8217;t be happier with the outcome!</span></p>

On the list? None other than two-tone kitchen cabinets. They bring visual interest to the kitchen, plus allow for more color exploration without feeling overpowering. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e’ve seen the look in so many Sweeten renovations (including these seven spaces) that we decided to shine a spotlight on it. See how these homeowners put their personal spin on the trend.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17_07_11_AD_Gillin_Firshein_02190217.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28173 size-full" title="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17_07_11_AD_Gillin_Firshein_02190217.jpg" alt="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17_07_11_AD_Gillin_Firshein_02190217.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17_07_11_AD_Gillin_Firshein_02190217-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17_07_11_AD_Gillin_Firshein_02190217-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17_07_11_AD_Gillin_Firshein_02190217-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17_07_11_AD_Gillin_Firshein_02190217-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
1. Contemporary meets classic</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to describe this kitchen: </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/brooklyn-kitchen-shows-off-dazzling-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contemporary meets classic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bi-tonal paint (white upper cabinets and gray lower) adds to the modern, yet, traditional feel already established by the mix of open shelves and closed cabinets.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36552 size-full" title="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-06.jpg" alt="Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, apartment combination, design, construction, kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Modern and clean</h3>
<p>Megan and Zak’s kitchen renovation was part of a much larger project: <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining two apartments with very different styles</a>. The reimagined kitchen represents their combined vision of a modern, clean space. The navy and white cabinets and floating shelves add clean lines and an airy feel.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37769 size-full" title="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg" alt="New Jersey, Jersey City, renovation, two family, remodel, one family, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>3. Mixing tones for a pop of color</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be teal our hearts! Carol and Jon took the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-tone </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">idea up a notch with a fun teal hue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The warm, bright color adds character and also accentuates other features in the kitchen, like the gold pendant lights and wood floors.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35243 size-full" title="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-21.jpg" alt="home renovation, kitchen renovation, two-tone cabinets, open shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-21-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-21-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-21-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>4. Gold and green to add contrast in cabinets</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maggie and Ross’ renovation was all about reaching a compromise on their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different design aesthetics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These light green cabinets (with white uppers) are just one example of how the couple merged their tastes.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20252 size-full" title="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-1.jpg" alt="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>5.  Jewel-tones</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue and white cabinets</a> are one of the most common color combinations we see (not surprising considering its versatility). Nikki and Chris opted for a bright jewel-tone blue in their sweet cook space. They wanted a color that stands out without being overpowering.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37558 size-full" title="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>6. Wood accents to ground lower cabinets</h3>
<p>Wood cabinets are experiencing a comeback. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/44-square-foot-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pair them with a solid paint finish</a> on the top cabinets, like Sunghee and Joseph, and you have a trend goldmine.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-34775 size-full alignnone" title="Two-tone kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Two-tone kitchen cabinets in gray and white" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>7. Two-tone cabinet neutrals</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s proof you can stick to neutrals and still pull off two-tone. Nilda and Brian went with a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-250-square-foot-kitchen-finds-its-bliss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dark gray base of cabinets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to elevate their cook space. Plus, it also ties-in with their stainless steel appliances and cabinet hardware.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Rita and Mark lived in their 500-square-foot apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops for four years before they decided to take on a renovation. Their bathroom, with a pine toilet seat and coordinating medicine cabinet, didn’t offer enough storage or fit in with the couple’s aesthetic. They wanted items like towels and toiletries to be contained to the room, without creating clutter. While this wasn’t their first remodel (the couple renovated their kitchen and bath in New Jersey) they knew circumstances would be different given the requirements and peculiarities of renovating in an NYC co-op building. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>, ready to take on a cosmetic overhaul.</p>

The layout stayed the same, also known as a “rip-and-replace,&#8221; and they focused on cosmetic changes. They decided to stick with white to make the bathroom appear larger, plus the neutral palette allowed Rita to change out accessories and colors at any point. “My first color palette came from the painting <i>The Bath Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida</i> which a friend gave me years ago in Madrid. I love the mix of blues and it reminds me of the wonderful times we’ve spent with our sons and their friends at the beach,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38774 size-full" title="console-bathroom-sink-and-mirror" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-09.jpg" alt="white bathroom with console sink and mirror and white subway tiles on walls and floating glass shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-09-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The couple swapped out the old tub for a cast iron tub because of the material’s durability, and resistance to chipping and scratching. Since they found storage solutions through a niche in the shower and wall shelves, there was no need for a full vanity. Plus, the open sink makes the bathroom feel even more open. They wanted every material used to be easy to clean and made of glass or chrome. Wood was a big &#8220;no&#8221; because of the humidity, as the bathroom only had a vent and no fan.</p>
<p>Their Sweeten contractor worked with the co-op board, employees, and other residents to get certain tasks done. His experience with that part of the process was crucial. When they realized they needed access to the apartment below to repair plumbing connected to the bathtub, he took the initiative to talk to the owners. “His answer was always ‘no problem,’” Rita shared. “He was a dream to work with, he’s a doer and tackles problems right away.” He also convinced the co-op board to replace all the risers while the walls were open. The building plumbing is over 75 years old so this repair was especially important.</p>

<p>Rita offers her advice for future renovators: “Talk to as many people and vendors that you have time for. It is the best way to get a feel for what you really want to do with the space,” she said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Rita had initially imagined installing a medicine cabinet along the whole width of the wall above the sink. Instead, she chose open glass shelves that could fit various organizational items like baskets and containers.</p>

<p><em>The search for a home to fit Melissa and Russ&#8217; growing family was becoming imperative. They loved their Park Slope neighborhood and sunny apartment but had already rearranged their space to fit their first child and then a second. When they found their new two-bedroom co-op in </em>a <em>historic brownstone, it had a great layout but needed updating. The couple looked on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and discovered a renovation they loved on the site’s blog. They hired the designers of that project, Casey and Kumar of <a href="https://www.studiomilleratre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio Miller Atre</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a>. Coincidently, it was the designers’ own Sweeten home renovation. Melissa and Russ even hired the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same Sweeten contractor</a>!</em></p>

<p>Four years ago, when our son was only a few months old, we got serious about looking for a two-bedroom apartment. We had gotten married and moved in together only a year before, so when our son arrived, we knew we needed more space. We focused our search mainly on Park Slope and nearby areas because we loved the neighborhood, but as the months wore on, we realized how scarce nice two-bedrooms with a practical layout in our neighborhood really were.</p>
<p>Large multi-dwelling buildings had good layouts, but there were very few on the market. Most of the brownstone apartments had living rooms smaller and darker than ours, which was sunny and overlooked treetops and a church belfry across the street.</p>
<p>A year later, our daughter was born, and our quest for the perfect two-bedroom became more urgent. Still, it was hard to find something we liked. In the meantime, we had configured our apartment bedroom to accommodate one child, then reconfigured it to accommodate two, and while we were happy in our space, we were excited to find something more reasonable for the four of us.</p>

<p>When we finally found our current apartment, three full years later, we were thrilled. Situated on the third floor of a 19th-century brownstone in the Park Slope Historic District, the apartment had a great layout but was a bit run-down. The first thing we noticed was the living room, which spanned the full width of the building and had three windows overlooking a tree-filled courtyard in back. Even in March, when the branches were bare, we could sense how peaceful it was. The bedrooms faced the tree-lined street in front.</p>
<p>The unit hadn’t been updated since the building was converted to a co-op in the 1980s. We were eager to design it from scratch to make the apartment look simple and elegant. We intended to give the master bedroom to the kids and convert it into a giant playroom and keep the second bedroom for our own bed and home office. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exposed brick walls</a> in the living room and bedroom were cold and dark, so we planned to cover them with sheetrock and paint the walls white. We also knew a custom kitchen would be our best bet.</p>

As interior designers, they did a beautiful job on their own kitchen, so we chose to hire them and the Sweeten contractors they used.</p>
<p>Because it was an open kitchen/dining/living area, we wanted to design the space in a way that wouldn’t make us feel like we were always in the kitchen. Casey and Kumar immediately understood what we were looking for and proposed a few designs that would make the kitchen space feel separate, which included building a partial wall that would eventually align with the built-in bookshelf we needed to accommodate our books. After our discussions, Kumar sent us a drawing of the proposed kitchen and bookshelf and our Sweeten contractor did an amazing job executing his vision.</p>
<p>We decided to keep the layout as it was and carve out more storage space, with floor-to-ceiling cabinets in white lacquer hiding the washer/dryer and refrigerator. In the narrow space between these two appliances, our contractor built a custom pull-out pantry.</p>
<p>On the perpendicular wall sat an exposed workspace with sink, dishwasher, and stove and ash wood veneer cabinets. We got rid of the old island, and Casey and Kumar designed an elegant new one with plenty of storage space.</p>
<p>For our countertop and backsplash, we chose soapstone, and are very happy with the result. To maintain an uncluttered countertop we had a drain board carved directly into the soapstone. My husband picked out the hardware with Casey. The kitchen is a dream.</p>

We donated them to <a href="https://www.bigreuse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Reuse</a>. We didn’t want to cover them up entirely because we wanted to retain the sense of a hearth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we planned white subway tile and black porcelain tiles [for the bathroom] but it evolved into something more ornate under Casey’s direction.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Kumar proposed adding mirrors matching the height of the windows on either side of what had been the fireplace, along with cabinets below, we really felt our space was coming together. The mirrors added depth and dimension, along with light being reflected. For years, we had lived in a corner apartment with plenty of windows and the addition of mirrors in our new apartment really opened the space up.</p>

We chose a gray travertine stone to line the wall with the tub, sink, and fixtures, and narrow white tiles in the bathtub area, which Casey arranged in alternating vertical and horizontal patterns.</p>

<p>Aside from one overhead light in the kitchen and one in the bathroom, the entire apartment was devoid of light fixtures. We added a pendant lamp above the dining room table and a globe lamp over the kitchen island, along with recessed lights in the living room, hallway, and bedrooms. The lights under the kitchen cabinets are especially practical and elegant. Our contractor finished the underside of the cabinets with the same ash veneer as the fronts.</p>
<p>All in all, we are tremendously happy with our space. Casey and Kumar’s vision, combined with our Sweeten general contractor’s excellent craftsmanship, resulted in a space that feels modern and civilized. The toys are contained in the children’s space, and when we manage to put everything away, our living and dining area can be free of clutter.</p>
<p>Our apartment is perfect. It’s functional and beautiful, and we love it more every day.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Melissa and Russ, for sharing your new family home with us!</em></p>
<p>DESIGN NOTES FROM STUDIO MILLER ATRE:</p>
<div>
<div><em>This project was really fun and engaging. The planning was clear from the beginning, so we were able to focus our creative efforts on spatial expression. The main shared space of the home is defined by a distinct function on each of the four sides: kitchen, dining, living, and a view of the garden through a wall of windows. </em></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><em> </em></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><em>The kitchen is anchored by a wall of full-height millwork into which all appliances and storage are neatly organized; one large millwork features a </em><em>pull-out panel. The dining area is centered on the hearth and flanked by a pair of full-height mirrors which match the dimensions of the existing windows to make what would otherwise appear a solid wall a source of light and spatial depth. The living space is nestled into a wall of books, which extends out into the main hallway to give the sitting area a bit of seclusion. Each of these elements is distinct in its function and feeling, but as a group, they form a common visual language.</em></p>

<h3>Remodeling for a fresher aesthetic</h3>
<p>Erica purchased her first apartment, a one-bedroom in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. “Everything was in working order, but my hope was to eventually fully gut and renovate the kitchen and bathroom,” she said. First the kitchen, and two years later decided the bathroom’s time had come. The all-pink-everything (the toilet, tub, sink, and wall tiles) had to go. “I knew I wanted a more zen, spa-like bathroom without the added expense of switching the location of the existing plumbing,” she shared.</p>

<p>Ready to get started, Erica posted her project to Sweeten. “Sweeten was extremely attentive to my needs as I searched for a contractor,” she shared. After reviewing her options of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local general contractors</a> in Brooklyn, she hired one to work with. Then, her renovation team—her Sweeten general contractor and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interior designer Amy E. Bishop</a>—joined forces to revamp Erica’s bathroom into a relaxing retreat.</p>
<h4>Key design element: hexagon tiles in the bathroom</h4>
<p>They developed a design that would maximize style and storage. Amy and Erica created a Pinterest board to share ideas, and the designer helped guide the overall look, starting with a three-drawer vanity the homeowner loved. As they were finalizing their concept, Erica’s mom pointed out the lack of a backsplash behind the vanity might be an issue, calling her &#8220;a splasher.&#8221; Hence, they designed a backsplash with hexagon tiles in the bathroom. The cascading formation carried over from the shower wall, offered a creative and practical solution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="Hexagon tiled shower wall with large vanity mirror over sink and backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="678" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48825" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11-300x203.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Storage in a small bathroom</h3>
<p>With limited space, the storage options would get creative. Shelves above the door hold toilet paper and other supplies, while a large medicine cabinet and custom in-shower shelves host Erica’s growing collection of skincare and beauty products. Her general contractor played an integral part in executing the custom idea. The original design placed the shelves on a different wall. However, once her contractor discovered it was solid cement, they relocated the double-stacked niches to the bathroom&#8217;s back wall accented by the hexagon tiles. The contracting team also made sure all the electrical was up to code (which wasn’t the case before they came in).</p>

<h3>Hexagon tiles in a bathroom bring on the calm</h3>
<p>Living with her cat Gigi onsite throughout the renovation and using the powder room in her building’s laundry room were the biggest hardships Erica experienced during the five-week renovation. They were well-worth the sacrifice.</p>
<p>“I absolutely love the bathroom!  Everything is so fresh and clean with a much more sophisticated color palette and design. With my enormous medicine cabinet, shower niches, vanity, and shelving over the door, I appreciate the ability to be much more organized getting ready for work in the morning,” Erica said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>From navy to cobalt, these blue kitchens by Sweeten show off the power of the cool hue</h2>
<p>One thing’s for sure: Blue kitchens and cabinets are no longer just a trend—they’re a new classic. Thanks to the endless shade options, the color can work for every renovator’s cook space, no matter their style. Ahead, check out these eight spaces, renovated by Sweeten general contractors, that prove blue is here to stay.</p>
<h3>A splash of blue patterned wallpaper for a Brooklyn kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21189 size-full" title="blue kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>A run-of-the-mill kitchen was not in the books for Mollie. She wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen with lots of personality, bold color, and print</a>—and that’s exactly what she got. Whimsical wallpaper with pops of orange and a blue backdrop plays off the azure lower cabinets and picks up the warmth of the gold hardware.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>A new layout (and new hue) revitalize a cramped kitchen </b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37424 mb-0 size-full" title="blue kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/modern-colonial-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subtle gray-blue cabinets</a> are right on par with the traditional-meets-modern style of Nydia and Jonathan’s kitchen. They paired the cabinets with a mix of metals, from the brushed gold bar stools to the stainless appliances, giving the otherwise classic cook space a contemporary edge.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Blue and glass to provide contrast</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32475 mb-0 size-full" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-golden-chairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with golden chairs and blue kitchen cabinets with silver appliances after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<strong><br />
</strong>Blue is Tracey’s favorite color, so she and her husband Brian decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue kitchen cabinets in their Westchester home</a>. After looking at fan decks to find the perfect shade, they expected they’d have to go custom. Luckily, the cabinets they chose were available in a stock color close to the swatch, so they saved on time and money.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Blue cabinet bottoms make a bright base</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34489 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14.jpg" alt="Park Slope renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Laura and Walter’s home is full of original details, especially in the kitchen area. They opted for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue cabinets that demand attention</a>, while still letting the architectural elements shine. Another trick to pulling off a bold shade of blue like theirs? Sticking to mostly lower cabinets and leaving the white walls exposed so the color isn’t overpowering.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Cool blue-gray hit the mark in a blue Brooklyn kitchen</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31162 mb-0 size-full" title="blue kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>When it finally came time to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovate her kitchen and living area</a> (after five years of dreaming and planning), Lauren had to have one notable detail. “I’ve always loved blue cabinets and knew that I wanted to do darker kitchen cabinets with a lighter floor and a white countertop,” she said. She chose an understated gray-blue shade for the custom cabinets that complemented the rest of the home’s decor.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>A blue kitchen inspired by a childhood home in Italy</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37963 mb-0 size-full" title="blue kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, living room, design, construction, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no shortage of color</a> in Giulia’s apartment. “I love the contrast of the blue and white oak. I had the same colors in my bedroom in Rome when I was a kid and I think it just reminded me of home,” she said.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>First-time Brooklyn renovators learn a few lessons after replacing the wood floors in their home</h2>
<p><em>After nearly a decade of bouncing from one New York apartment to another, Katie, Marcus, and their pup, Squib, were ready to put down roots. They purchased a 750-square-foot Park Slope co-op knowing they would renovate right away and before moving in. They closed in April and had a move-in date of May 31; any renovation had to go quickly. But they were optimistic because the apartment was in great shape, and other than replacing the floors and updating the bathroom, there wasn’t anything major that needed doing–or so they thought. Floors, it turns out, can be a tricky challenge. They posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten </a>to find a vetted general contractor. Between <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a> and Client Service&#8217;s help, Katie, Marcus, and Squib can now stand on stable ground.</em></p>

<p>Before we did our final walk-through, we had only visited our apartment once at the open house. In our home search, we had developed a pretty thorough checklist of what to look for at every apartment we visited: “Were bathrooms properly ventilated?” “Did windows need replacing?” “Were the floors even?” In this apartment, which was probably built in the 1920s, the wood floors were uneven and noisy. We knew we’d have to replace them, and it would be easier to do so before moving in. Since we were going to be redoing the floors, we figured we might as well redo the bathroom as it&#8217;s hard to live without one in a one-bath apartment! It wasn’t in bad shape, it was just a bit out of date and not our style.</p>

<p>Settling on an overall style was a bit of a challenge as Marcus likes deep, rich colors and lots of décor, and I tend to like bright, clean spaces with straight lines and pops of color or contrast. Right off the bat, we had to figure out our combined vision for the space so we wouldn&#8217;t argue over every little thing.</p>

<p>Other than that, our first big challenge came when the contractor began to rip up the floorboards. There was no subfloor. There was nothing but air between our old floorboards and the ceiling of the apartment below. No wonder it had been so noisy!</p>
<p>Since the building was old, there was the added challenge of trying to re-level an apartment where everything had been built or altered for a dramatically uneven floor. We weren&#8217;t able to get it completely level. There’s even a section of brick wall underneath part of our bedroom floor. From what? We’ll never really know. The floor is still noticeably uneven in parts, and we&#8217;ve had to get levelers for most of our furniture, but it’s much better than when we started.</p>
<p>We wanted a wood floor that would bring some warmth to our home and be durable for years of Squib running back and forth over it. We selected red oak because I love how it warms up the space, and plays off the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exposed brick</a> of the fireplace. Our contractor was helpful in guiding us to a good stain and style of baseboards. (There weren’t any baseboards originally, but we liked having something to transition from the wall to the floor.) We also did do a bit of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing under the floors</a>.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, we replaced the water-damaged wood floor with slate tile which we felt would be more durable. It&#8217;s not a large space, and we’ll probably update our kitchen at some point, so we kept the tile neutral.</p>

<p>The bathroom was our main project focus. We wanted something simple and crisp. It&#8217;s not a huge bathroom and we didn&#8217;t want to overwhelm the space. We chose a classic white subway tile for the walls and slate tile for the floor. While I love the look of a honeycomb floor tile, it’s too hard to keep clean and grime-free. To break up the subway tile, we added a little black edging under the chair rail. Thankfully our contractor had done something similar on a previous job so we were able to see an example of it before committing!</p>
<p>We also wanted to maximize storage in the bathroom. We kept a wall cabinet in its place and repainted it. Our contractor built a little nook in the shower, which we hadn’t even thought of, but ended up loving! The storage under the sink wasn’t useful because of the pipes. We compensated by including a large medicine cabinet.</p>

<p>One thing we didn’t anticipate was how hard it would be to find a sink without faucet holes. Since our faucet comes out of the wall, almost every sink without pre-made faucet holes had to be specially made. As a result, our sink didn&#8217;t arrive until after we moved in, and we had to settle for a vanity with drawers that weren&#8217;t compatible with our plumbing.</p>
<p>We are in the process of having a friend modify it so we can actually utilize that space. Here’s a tip: vanities are unbelievably expensive and you can really only use the Ikea vanities with Ikea sinks, or it will take a lot of modification to make it work. Listen to your husband when he tells you that.</p>
<p>But live and learn. This was our first ever renovation. In the span of seven weeks, we closed on our apartment, renovated, moved, and started working 14-hour days. We also got married in the middle of all this! It was so hard to source things in a timely manner and, instead of having fun looking at lighting or tile or paint colors, we just wanted everything done so we could stop making choices.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38263 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-723x482.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, renovation, bedroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The high-speed ride led to fun miscommunications like me accidentally telling the painters to paint both bedrooms deep teal because I actually forgot that we had two bedrooms and told them to “paint the bedroom teal.” Looks like we have a painting project ahead of us.</p>
<p>Our contractor was somehow able to complete the majority of the work in our accelerated time frame even after laying a new subfloor for the whole apartment. He was very communicative and offered great tips and guidance on what would look better or last longer in the space. He was clear about what was happening at every step of the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38264 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dog" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-723x1085.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, renovation, pet" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The people at the Sweeten office, too, checked in with us throughout the process to ensure that everything was going smoothly. The Sweeten blog was helpful for finding design inspiration and sources when the full scope of products available on the internet proved overwhelming. The Sweeten cost guides helped us create a budget.</p>
<p>We realized afterward that it would be great to have two budgets, an “on paper this is what we want to spend&#8221; budget and a &#8220;we cannot afford to go over this number&#8221; budget. That way you can assess what will be worth the money and what you can scale back on if something comes up. Start sourcing things early, if possible. It&#8217;s better to get the thing you want early and move it around your living room for a few weeks then to not get what you want because it won&#8217;t arrive in time.</p>
<p>We were excited to finally have our own space to make our own! I grew up on the campus of a boarding school so I had never been able to paint my walls before, let alone really personalize a space. We love our apartment so much and are so happy with everything. The bathroom turned out perfectly and the floors are much more beautiful and practical than the original ones we started with.</p>
<p>Like every homeowner, we have many more projects that we will eventually want to do, but I&#8217;m happy we started with just the flooring and the bathroom so we didn&#8217;t bite off more than we could handle with our first apartment purchase.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Upgrade a full bath and powder room</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Saira and her husband purchased their East Village duplex with the intention to renovate before moving in. “The two most urgent spaces were the bathrooms,” she said. “They were just very old.” Their style is very clean, minimal, and modern—everything the existing spaces were not. With two young kids, the couple was also worried about having only one full bathroom, which made it even more important to have the spaces updated with new fixtures and better storage options. Equipped with Saira’s Pinterest board for inspiration, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project to Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-and-powder-room" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48828 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2.jpg" alt="View of bathroom and powder room before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />

<em>(Above)</em> The full bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: With a clear vision in mind, Saira worked with her Sweeten general contractor to bring it to life. The bathrooms share a black-and-white palette and many of the same materials, like the floating wood shelves and industrial light fixtures (which match others throughout the apartment). “I love the contrast of the white tiles with the matte black hardware,” Saira said. They opted for a pedestal sink in the powder room to save on space.</p>
<p>Keeping the design really simple visually and functionally was very important—especially for their children’s safety and their own sanity. The floating vanity in the full bathroom is easier to clean and has just enough room under it for the kids’ step stools, too. “We were very mindful of certain things, like making sure the tile was easy to clean and not too slippery,” Saira said. Their contractor helped pull materials using Saira’s Pinterest board and the couple’s budget as guidelines.</p>

<p>For the most part, Saira communicated with the contracting team via email, receiving pictures of the progress throughout the process. “Our general contractor was always willing to meet at times that were convenient to us,” she said. Fortunately, the project stayed on schedule so the family didn’t have to renew their lease and stay in their rental.</p>
<p>Saira’s parents actually own a real estate business in Toronto, so while she does have remodeling experience, this was her first time doing so in New York City. “Everyone always says renovating is a nightmare, but if you find the right general contractor and you have a good relationship, it can be pretty fun,” she shared.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The family also had the entire apartment repainted, the floors refinished, and a new closet built by their Sweeten general contractor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What to do yourself vs. leave to the general contractor during a renovation</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38687 mb-0 size-chrono" title="diy vs contractor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-723x482.jpg" alt="construction, diy vs contractor" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Whether for budgetary reasons or because you’d like to contribute some sweat equity to your new home, you might be tempted to take on a portion of the renovation yourself. Depending on how you rank on the handiness scale, you may be able to contribute, and you should first discuss with your general contractor what is safe for you to do. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten,</a> a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveyed some of its GCs to get their take on the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of homeowner helpfulness.</p>
<h2><b>What to DIY</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sourcing materials</li>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Updating hardware (ie. knobs, pulls)</li>
<li>Assembling modular cabinetry or closet systems</li>
<li>Hanging small fixtures (ie. towel racks, swapping out a light fixture)</li>
<li>Installing wallpaper</li>
</ul>
<h3>DO: Source materials</h3>
<p>One of the initial tasks of a renovation is to source materials. “If you&#8217;re excited about the renovation and want to participate, a major task you can help with is to select materials, fixtures, and finishes as soon as possible,&#8221; says Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill. &#8220;Collaborate with your contractor to confirm the materials you need, including the measurements and the sequence in which they should be ordered and delivered. Getting this completed is a bigger deal than it sounds, and paves the way for a successful renovation.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Walter</a> tells us that he often works with clients who like to find their own materials. “This saves time if the client already knows what they want, he says. &#8220;They can make the list and I will look it over.” In some scenarios, the clients are working with a designer, who also helps with the sourcing.</p>

<h3>DO: Easy refreshes</h3>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Matt</a> explains that good DIY projects should be inexpensive upgrades and only “require minimal tools.&#8221; “Some simple DIY projects that homeowners can do is to freshen up the room with a coat of paint, update kitchen/bathroom hardware, install wallpaper, or spruce up the front entry with greenery,” he says.</p>
<h3>DO: Paint</h3>
<p>Generally, DIY painting is a great cost-saving measure because of the large disparity between the cost of professional painting and a DIY job. This is because painting is mainly about labor—and it does require skill if your walls need a lot of prep work. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Phil</a> says that this job is a good candidate for a DIY because it’s “confined, not noisy, and relatively easy. Prep work is the hard part, so a homeowner could outsource that part and just do the painting.” Importantly, “it’s at the end of the project, you don’t hold anything up.”</p>
<h3>DO: Work that requires minimal tools</h3>
<p>If you’re a patient person with attention to detail, you can also assemble your own modular kitchen cabinets and closet systems, while outsourcing the installation to a general contractor. Many modular projects, such as those from IKEA, are geared toward homeowner assembly, so they require minimal skills and tools.  You can now find wallpaper that is installation-friendly. In general, though, you may need a second set of hands to help with this detailed-oriented task.</p>
<h2><b>What to Leave for the Pros</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Demolition</li>
<li>Plumbing or electrical work</li>
<li>Any kind of structural work</li>
<li>Skim coating</li>
<li>Tilework</li>
<li>Flooring</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, it may not be advisable for a homeowner to take on renovation projects, even if they feel capable. In many urban apartment buildings, for example, you are governed by co-op, condo, and city regulations that require a professional to undertake any contracting work. Your building will require your contractor to provide a license and insurance information to hold the firm accountable for the work being done in your home. If you do the work yourself, you could get yourself and your general contractor into trouble.</p>

<h3>DON’T: Take on demolition, plumbing, or electrical</h3>
<p>Rules and regulations aside, there is also the matter of safety. Sweeten general contractor Phil told us that he’s had clients ask to do their own demolition in the past. “It may seem easy, but actually, there’s a lot to consider,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You create a lot of garbage; how do you get it out? What if you damage something that you have to preserve? What if you get hurt in the process?” These considerations also guide our recommendation that anything structural, or involving plumbing or electricity, is best left to the professionals.</p>
<h3>DON&#8217;T: Consider skim coating</h3>
<p>Skim coating is a process that hand-applies a layer of mud used in construction over the surface of your walls and ceilings and is then smoothed by hand. General contractor Walter strongly advises against a homeowner from taking on this task. &#8220;Spackling takes a lot of skill and practice that should be left to a professional,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If done incorrectly it would ruin the finished product of the job.&#8221; Jean talks about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating here</a>.</p>
<h3>DON’T: Install flooring or tiles</h3>
<p>Flooring and tile work are other areas that homeowners often consider DIYing. Depending on the level of difficulty and your own experience with this type of work, you may attempt to take it on. But if you’ve never done it before, you may not be able to execute it properly. Any mistakes will have to be fixed by the contractor, which delays the project and costs everyone time and your money.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43105 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg" alt="clean up after renovation" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>DON’T: Take on projects that may cause delay</h3>
<p>The final consideration that Sweeten contractors point out is timing. If a DIY project is something that must happen in the middle of the project and be finished before the rest of the work can continue, homeowners must complete the DIY project when they say they will. Otherwise, the entire project falls behind.</p>
<p>General contractors are responsible for scheduling their workers, as well as any subcontractors for electrical or plumbing work, to make sure everyone’s job is completed in a timely fashion. If you, as the homeowner, have not finished assembling the kitchen cabinets, they can’t be mounted, the countertops cannot go in, the backsplash cannot be installed. (You get the picture.) These delays can be very costly. For this reason, the best DIY projects tend to be those that happen at the end of a renovation (like painting!).</p>
<p>With these do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts in mind, go ahead and take on the tasks that give the professionals the space they need to keep your renovation moving along on schedule. You’ll soon be enjoying your new space with a touch of your own handiwork.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In style, but also in for the long haul</h2>
<p>As one of the hardest working rooms in any home, the bathroom deserves its time in the design spotlight too. After you think about the must-haves (toilet, sink, and shower) there’s plenty of opportunity to insert your taste, from the tile down to the hardware. Sweeten highlights five ideas we predict will take off next year, based on seeing thousands of bath remodels.</p>
<p>Here are the biggest 2019 bathroom trends to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matte black hardware</li>
<li>Accessible design</li>
<li>Wood-look tile</li>
<li>Floating vanities</li>
<li>Full-tiled walls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Matte Black Hardware</h2>

<p>As far as hardware goes, gold and silver don’t even come close to the timelessness of matte black. The neutral, shine-free finish works for all styles, from modern to rustic, and will give any bathroom a polished touch.</p>
<p><em>(From top to bottom)</em> Sherry’s bathroom is full of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong design statements</a>, including the all-matte black hardware. White-out bathrooms are the perfect accompaniment to the darker detail, as seen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/desperately-seeking-a-laundry-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynn and Craig’s bathroom</a>, as well as <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/guest-full-bathroom-renovation-east-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saira’s</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Accessible Design</b></h2>

<p>One of the most important elements in home design—especially in bathrooms—is finally taking center stage. From disability bars in showers to higher toilets, making bathrooms easy to use and accessible for those with limited mobility should always be a priority (and is sometimes legally required!).</p>
<p><em>(From top to bottom)</em> A family in Queens <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/senior-friendly-bathroom-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converted an extra room</a> into a senior-friendly bathroom complete with a curbless shower for their mother. Inspired by her own parents&#8217; &#8220;aging-in-place&#8221; updates, Megan decided to use door levers instead of knobs throughout their apartment and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed hand showers in their master and guest bathrooms</a>. Debbie combined two poorly designed bathrooms into <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/elderly-senior-friendly-bathroom-the-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one accessible space</a> with enough room for her father’s wheelchair.</p>

<p>For very practical reasons, wood (aside from vanities or shelves) is not a common feature in bathrooms. Of course, thanks to wood-look tile, the natural appeal can still be achieved.</p>
<p><em>(From top to bottom)</em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marble walls and wood-look tile</a> are the perfect pairing in Christina’s studio bathroom; Maggie and Ross took the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ceramic trend to the back of the shower wall</a> for a spa-like feel, while Penny and Kevin chose to complement the blue and white tile in the rest of the bathroom with a lighter <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/sunset-park-locally-sourced-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gray wood-look floor</a>.</p>

<p>Wall-hung vanities do more than just look pretty. The extra space means the flooring can extend to the wall, which makes the room look bigger. Floating vanities also make cleaning easier (less nooks and crannies to deal with).</p>

<p>If you find a tile you love, why not lay it from floor to ceiling? The luxe treatment gives a bathroom a cohesive and clean look, plus is moisture-and-water-resistant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>From cabinet colors to appliances, these ideas are going strong</h2>
<p>When it comes to fashion or interiors, trends come and they go. In the renovation space, styles and ideas are a little less fleeting—especially in kitchens, as replacing cabinets, countertops, or even flooring is definitely not an annual occurrence. Based on seeing thousands of kitchen remodel wish lists, Sweeten has identified patterns we predict will gain traction in 2019, while also becoming new reno classics.</p>
<p>Here are the biggest 2019 kitchen trends to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Two-tone cabinets</li>
<li class="p1">Minimalistic hardware</li>
<li class="p1">Integrated appliances</li>
<li class="p1">Hidden storage</li>
<li class="p1">Statement light fixtures</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Two-Tone Cabinets</b></h2>

<p>Two-tone cabinets bring more visual interest to the kitchen, plus allow for more color exploration without feeling overpowering. White upper cabinets give the illusion of higher ceilings and more space, while darker upper cabinets create a cozier ambiance and ground the space.</p>
<p><em>(From top to bottom) </em>The couple selected custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light blue and white cabinets</a> that tie in perfectly with their sleek silver hardware and ornate tile floor. In this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/park-slope-kitchen-remodel-navy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">navy and white kitchen</a>, the dark blue base cabinets give warmth to the otherwise neutral look. The pairing of white and gray shaker-style cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/brooklyn-kitchen-shows-off-dazzling-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this cook space</a> adds to the modern-meets-traditional style.</p>
<h2><b>Minimalistic Hardware</b></h2>

<p>Hardware may not be the star of your kitchen renovation, but it definitely contributes to the overall vibe. This year, we’ve seen traditional knobs fall in favor of simple pulls that are no less practical—just more subtle.</p>
<p><em>(From top to bottom) </em>In Jen’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/scandinavian-kitchen-renovation-crown-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scandinavian-inspired kitchen</a>, she opted for barely-there black matte pulls that contrast with the simple white cabinets. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/44-square-foot-kitchen-storage/">Sunghee and Joseph</a> went with similar black pulls in their minimal space. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/financial-district-couple-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonali and Shalaj</a> chose silver hardware to match their appliances.</p>
<h2><b>Integrated Appliances</b></h2>

<p>There are two types of people in this world: ones who are partial to exposed appliances and those who would rather keep them hidden. (Kidding, but really!) Ultimately, it’s up to personal preference, but our recent renovations prove that integrated appliances are making their mark.</p>
<p><em>(From top to bottom) </em>Trendsetting renovators Maggie and Ross (<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out their two-tone cabinets!</a>) installed a sleek Bosch hood vent that slides in and out. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-250-square-foot-kitchen-finds-its-bliss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The paneled dishwasher</a> in Nilda and Brian’s kitchen is so discreet, it’s nearly impossible to locate—P.S. it’s right next to the kitchen sink.

<p>As islands and peninsulas have become mainstays in kitchens renovations, so have stand-out light fixtures to hang above them. Whether a chandelier or a more classic sconce, including a dramatic source, immediately makes a kitchen more intimate.</p>
<p><em>(From top to bottom) </em>Megan and Zak installed a modern gold fixture in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue and white kitchen</a>, highlighting the Midas touches elsewhere. In Nydia’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/modern-colonial-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colonial cook space</a>, a bronze chandelier takes center stage.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Fix a crumbling bathroom in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: A prewar apartment’s charm can be a benefit and a curse. In Karun’s nearly century-old co-op bathroom, it was the latter. “I purchased the apartment from a sponsor [the owner who had previously rented out the space]. It likely had never been remodeled and was in desperate need of a makeover,” he said. The wall and floor tiles were cracking, and overall the bathroom didn’t reflect his industrial style. The entire apartment has been in a constant state of renovation since Karun moved in, and he wanted to make sure the bathroom changes matched the raw, exposed vibe of the other rooms. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project to Sweeten</a> and was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-tiles-with-red-trim"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48842 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White bathroom tiles with red trim and sink with vanity before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Karun-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Karun’s dream of a rugged, yet, refined bath came to life with an eclectic mix of materials and finishes. “I knew exactly how I wanted to do it, and my contractor was able to make it a reality,” he shared. More polished pieces like the Carrara marble sink and brushed bronze hardware balance out his edgier choices, like the vanity and raw cement walls. He included more modern touches too, opting for a wall-mounted faucet over the sink and marble herringbone tile for the floor. His sister built the floating wood shelves and vanity surface from a tree that fell in her backyard, which puts another personal spin on the bathroom.</p>

<p>His Sweeten contractor helpfully suggested modifications to Karun’s original plans, including choosing a contrasting color tile for the in-shower storage niche. Overall, the project went smoothly, though Karun did have to stay with his cousin for a longer time than expected due to plumbing delays.</p>
<p>As a first-time renovator tackling multiple projects, his biggest questions revolved around expected costs. “Estimates vary considerably,” he said. “Sweeten’s platform was invaluable in this respect.”</p>
<p>The bathroom turned out just as he expected. “[It’s] home, sweet, home. There’s nothing like living in a place that’s been customized to your own tastes,” he said.</p>

			<h2>Combining two apartments is never easy. See how these families combined spaces.</h2>
<p>Combining two apartments into one home is one of the most time-consuming (and rewarding!) projects in the renovation world. The reason behind the decision varies, but the need is usually the same&#8230; more space. These renovators approached us looking to find vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors who could <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merge apartment units</a> to fit their changing lifestyles. Learn more from these NYC apartment combination examples below.</p>

<h3>1. Building a peaceful city oasis</h3>
<p>When this homeowner’s search for a three-bedroom apartment ended in disappointment, he decided to go in another direction. He bought two apartments in an Upper West Side co-op building after consulting the building’s management and an architect, with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a plan to combine them</a>. Both units were located at the end of a hallway.</p>
<p>Working with his architect and the Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor</a> he hired, he decided to merge them together through their kitchens and replace them with an open kitchen. He also expanded the primary bedroom and bathroom, creating a mini spa with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>.</p>
<p>A few bumps came up during the project; converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes in order to meet code and when trying to designate an entryway, they realized the configuration just wasn’t working. He ended up buying additional square footage from the hallway to create a more inviting one. Construction took a total of six months of work. The time, effort, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation costs</a> were well worth it. The homeowner said the apartment, “feels like living in a peaceful oasis above the city.”</p>

<h3>2. Up against a wall</h3>
<p>Zoe had long dreamt of buying and combining apartments, so when she and her husband Arvid felt they had officially <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outgrown their 700-square-foot one-bedroom</a> in Lincoln Square, Manhattan, they took matters into their own hands. After sending letters to neighbors, they learned one was looking to move, and the couple bought their apartment.</p>
<p>The goal was to remove the two existing kitchens and replace them with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern cook space</a>, plus rip out floors, and create a third bedroom. They learned knocking down walls certainly doesn’t come without challenges. Their contractor came across an unmovable gas riser in a wall they had planned to take down to open up the dining area. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor assessed the options</a> and had a solution: Make it part of the architecture by designing a partition (pictured above) and creating a dining nook. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36557 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Combining two apartments gave this couple a spacious kitchen a room to grow their family in the city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label">(Above) Megan and Zak&#8217;s apartment combination in Manhattan</span></p>
<h3>3. Building one modern, family home</h3>
<p>When Megan and Zak bought a one-bedroom apartment in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, they hoped the space would work for them and maybe a baby down the line. A year after living in their space, not only did they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realize it needed to be renovated</a>, but also that the apartment really wasn’t big enough for another human (even a tiny one). Luck was on their side as an apartment next door was available.</p>
<p>Once they finalized the sale, the couple started planning to combine the two apartments into one modern, family home. The biggest changes in the overall floorplan included eliminating one kitchen and converting a living room into a primary bathroom. The rest of the renovation focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating an open concept kitchen</a> and living area.</p>
<p>While they did run into a few issues (like discovering pipes in a wall that needed to be rerouted), overall their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation experience went smoothly</a>. “Keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There’s a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family,” Megan shared.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Increase storage and counter space in a Queens, NY, kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Ed, a buyer for a retail department of a major New York City museum, purchased a sponsor apartment with his late wife, Kate, in Jackson Heights, Queens, nearly 16 years ago. (A sponsor unit is a unit or an apartment owned by the original owner or corporation responsible for turning a building from a rental into a co-op.) The kitchen was made up of cheap materials they knew someday they’d want to replace to fit their taste.</p>
<p>“We were pretty enamored by the bungalow/Arts and Crafts/Mission style, given that our building was built around the end of the ‘bungalow boom’ and the neighborhood shared a similar, working middle-class ethos,” Ed said. Otherwise, storage and the lack of counter space were a big issue for them. They came to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32386" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a>, and were matched with a general contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37738 size-full" title="old-patterned-floor-tiles-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets and beige walls and patterned floor tiles and see through door to kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37737 size-full" title="old-patterned-floor-tiles-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="two images of kitchen with oak cabinets and overmount stainless steel sink and patterned floor tiles before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The kitchen came together, capturing the essence of Arts and Crafts style: warm, cherry wood cabinets paired with an earthy green-blue backsplash and natural gray quartz countertops. They moved the fridge to another wall, but otherwise, the layout remained the same. A radiator on the west wall presented a minor design challenge; their contractor suggested working around it by leaving a space open beneath the countertop.</p>
<p>Most of the project went off without a hitch and any issues that popped up were solved quickly (or planned ahead for). When the contractor went to pick up the quartz slab for their counter, he discovered it had been damaged in the warehouse. To keep the renovation on schedule, he texted Ed photos of other, similar options he found. “What we picked actually ended up looking better,” Ed said.</p>
<p>The renovators hoped when they removed the vinyl flooring, the wood underneath would be in good enough shape to keep. It turned out the adhesive used to affix the subfloor ruined the fir floors. Their contractor had thought ahead though, and had a flooring supplier save oak planking just in case. Since they had such a great experience and their contractor handled every issue that popped up, Ed shared he didn’t feel the need to contact Sweeten’s Client Services.&#8221;It speaks very highly of Sweeten’s contractor assessments that nothing came up that need your intervention,” he pointed out.</p>

<h3>Lessons Ed learned post-renovation?</h3>
<p>1.) Have a cleaning crew lined up.<br />
2.) If you’re renovating your kitchen, make sure you have alternative places to have your meals in mind. 3.) Make sure your contractor has multiple suppliers he/she works with. Luckily, theirs did, but that might not always be the case.</p>

<p>While Kate and Ed worked on the plans for their kitchen together, she passed away before she could see it come to fruition. “The kitchen is almost entirely Kate’s conception,” Ed said. “It really feels like I’m living in her vision—it’s really comforting.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Elegant ways to use an apartment radiator cover to hide design eyesores</h2>
<p>Sometimes the little details of renovations fall by the wayside because there are so many design and construction decisions to make. That&#8217;s why it’s important to recognize seemingly minor updates that can have a big impact. For example, think about an apartment radiator cover. They’re not a building requirement, and they don&#8217;t influence a radiator&#8217;s efficiency. Still, this nice-to-have detail can instantly make any space look more polished and provide additional storage too.</p>
<p>Here are some ways <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners upped their radiator game. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>1. Sleek and modern</h3>
<p>The centerpiece of this Park Slope, Brooklyn renovation was <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/park-slope-kitchen-remodel-navy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kitchen</a>. However, the Sweeten general contractor helped complete a few other projects in the apartment, including a handsome radiator cover in the bedroom. “My growing puppy decided the cover was her favorite place to sit and watch squirrels,” the homeowner shared. “My general contractor came back to install reinforcements so it could handle the weight of a full-grown dog.”</p>

<h3>2. Bookshelf camouflage</h3>
<p>Lauren’s renovation involved updating her apartment&#8217;s layout so the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen and living areas were open and cohesive</a>. She focused on built-in storage in the kitchen and wanted to bring the same element to her living space. “A sleek bookshelf hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows,” she said. Plus, the radiator cover is perfect for displaying plants and knick-knacks.</p>

<h3>3. Repurposed design elements</h3>
<p>Architects Terri and Brett<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gutted their Prospect Heights co-op</a> to make it feel more bright and spacious. Every detail was a result of their collaboration, including radiator covers in the living area and bedroom. A millworker made the radiators easier to access for maintenances purposes. Plus, the new covers&#8217; tops were made from leftover stone slabs from the kitchen. This helped create a cohesive design throughout the whole house.</p>

<h3>4. Custom carpentry</h3>
<p>While Charon’s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gorgeous green bathroom renovation</a> was in progress, her Sweeten general contractor’s carpentry team took care of other apartment details. They built a custom bedroom radiator cover to match one she already had in the living area. The new cover joined the design elements of her home and put the finishing touch on her already pretty sleep space.</p>

<h3>4. Added storage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining two apartments is no easy job</a>. Luckily, Zoe and Arvid easily overcame that challenge. Plus, they made sure to still take notice of small (and important) details in their new home. The air conditioning unit and radiator in their living had 50 years of layered paint. Not to mention, it took up valuable space. With their general contractor&#8217;s help, they designed an apartment radiator cover that made the appliance less obtrusive and added shelves for extra storage.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh an old and outdated bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Penny, a product manager for a financial firm, and Kevin, a puppeteer with the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre, and their son, have lived in their over 100-year-old-plus co-op building for five years. They’ve been remodeling the Sunset Park, Brooklyn, apartment room by room, and until recently, waited on any major changes to the bathroom. They did, however, replace an old and “hideous” shower door with a curtain for a short-term fix. Once they were ready to bring the dingy space up to speed with their clean, simple style, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor.</a><strong><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While they stuck to the original footprint, Penny and Kevin made one big change that had a big impact on the overall look of the bathroom: replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower. “We spent most of our budget converting the old tub,” Penny shared. They were especially excited about the brand new glass door. A big priority for the couple was sourcing materials locally. When they went to select their wood-like porcelain tile floor at a nearby supplier, they found the light blue and white tiles from the same store. The hardware and major fixtures also come from a Brooklyn showroom close to their home.</p>

The only issue that came up during the renovation was a leak from an apartment upstairs. It was resolved, as the neighbor became more vigilant about making sure water didn’t escape from outside her shower curtain, though if it leaks again, the issue will have to be readdressed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the biggest challenge was the division of labor between Penny, Kevin, and their contractor—especially since the family was out of town for the majority of the project. The couple divided responsibilities, with Penny taking on the budget and Kevin handling the aesthetic aspects. “He presented me with beautiful designs and then I approved or suggested how we could do things on a budget,” Penny said.</p>
<p>They coordinated with their general contractor mostly via email and phone calls. “His willingness to work with a neighbor, send emails, and call was really helpful,” Penny said. As an experienced renovator, she’s learned to be more trusting of a contractor’s advice, but also that it’s important to speak up about what you’re looking to achieve.  “Be clear on what you want, don’t give up on your design, but be flexible and listen to your contractor. You will be surprised on how that can help—they see a lot.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Penny also added these words of wisdom: “Go with the contractor that listens and seems pleasant to work with,” she said.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating former rental properties to become sources of comfort, instead of income</h2>
<p>No matter how well you take care of a home, things can be damaged accidentally or worn down over time. This is especially true when renovating former rental properties. Especially when tenants move in and out year after year.</p>
<p>Sometimes, homeowners need a break from the stress of renting a property. And sometimes, they&#8217;re ready to hang up their hats as landlords and update their former leasing properties to live in themselves.

<h3>1.) Outdated Rental Property to Modern Apartment</h3>
<p>Sherry’s family purchased a Midtown East apartment in 2008. While they originally bought it as a rental property, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/">Sherry decided to move in</a> just ten years later. However, it hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s and had extensive water damage from a previous tenant. Still, the apartment had good bones (and space!). Her remodel involved replacing the flooring in every room. She also completely updated the kitchen and bathrooms to reflect her modern style.</p>

<h3>2. Prewar Studio to Charming Apartment</h3>
<p>New York City’s housing market is full of prewar apartments with elaborate features. When Emily moved to the city, she was in search of just that: <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a charming apartment with original details</a>. Her six-month search ended with the purchase of a 1940s studio apartment.</p>
<p>The apartment had long been used as a rental property—and didn&#8217;t reflect its historical roots. She worked with her Sweeten general contractor to restore the apartment to its former glory. They installed beautiful crown molding and paneling throughout.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30008 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>3.) Former Rental Property turned Uptown Retreat</h3>
<p>Ying and her parents’ Upper East Side apartment had seen many lives. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Originally purchased as an investment</a>, the owners and renters had lived in the apartment off and on. After the family hit their co-op’s rental limit, they decided to reimagine the space as a second home. The family added new flooring, paint, lighting, custom built-ins, and an overhauled bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30242 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>4.) Updated Urban Residence</h3>
<p>After renting out their Manhattan property for over a decade, JoAnn and Brian were ready to call the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urban residence their permanent home</a>. The couple was leaving behind a six-bedroom house in New Jersey for this mid-town one-bedroom. With that said, they needed an efficient space. That meant an emphasis on storage in the main living areas and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom had also seen better days. The couple completely redid the two spaces while sticking to the original layout.</p>
