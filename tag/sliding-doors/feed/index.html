<h3>Compact living in a junior one bedroom</h3>
<p>Dan and I lived on the Lower East Side for several years in typical rental apartments—tiny, no living rooms, dated kitchens and baths, and windows looking into someone else’s kitchen. In NYC real estate terms, this translates into “cozy!” We’re not big fans of moving, so purchasing an apartment together was always on our minds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Often, we’d walk past our current apartment building and joke about purchasing a studio there if we could find a relatively cheap unit to gut-renovate. Somehow this apartment showed up in an internet search and met our expectations, so we decided to buy it. We closed on the purchase but lived in our old apartment while the renovations were in progress.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44843 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44585 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12.jpg" alt="junior one bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44588 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span>The co-op had been built in the ‘60s and had not been touched—it was ugly. We knew it would need a complete overhaul. Our primary goal was some separation between the living/kitchen area and the sleeping space. We wanted it to feel less like a studio and more like a junior one bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="large-black-framed-window" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44842 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-bedroom-13-compressed.gif" alt="large black framed window in a white bedroom with barn door after renovation" width="1000" height="674" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44579 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5.jpg" alt="junior one bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Making a junior one bedroom work</h3>
<p class="p1">Because of Department of Building regulations, our architect said we couldn’t install full walls to divide the space. After a brainstorm with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect</a> and our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor, we decided to install custom sliding doors fabricated by a vendor. The doors allow us to keep the space open, but we can close them when we have overnight guests or just want some privacy. Though it was challenging to figure out the right door dimensions and make sure the ceiling was even, I think it was a smart investment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44583 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In addition, we wanted to remove the wall between the kitchen and the living space, fully renovate the kitchen and bathroom, and install new hardwood floors throughout. Fun—not fun—story: we ordered a new toilet online, and it came broken three times in a row. We were only able to get it in one piece when we picked it up at the store.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44581" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg" alt="Lower East Side renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3>Simple color palette for a small space</h3>
<p>Given the apartment’s small size, I used a limited material palette and color scheme—sort of a mix of Scandinavian, Japanese, and Lower East Side flavors. We went with white kitchen cabinets and tiles, chrome, black hardware, and a red oak floor. My favorite part of the renovation was picking materials and envisioning how each would look in the space. It was hard to find things I liked that fit our limited budget! However, I incorporated interesting textures and colors through decoration and furnishings so it wouldn’t feel too clinical.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44584 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44582 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8.jpg" alt="pattern backsplash tile" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44586 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9.jpg" alt="Eat-in niche" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>The right contractor for a first-time renovator</h3>
<p>My contractor was resourceful in accommodating our various needs and provided honest recommendations on what was feasible or not. For example, having a soaking tub in the bathroom was very important for Dan since he loves taking baths. Our bathroom door was tiny, so we weren&#8217;t sure how the tub would actually get in. Our contractor figured out how to open up the closet wall next to the bathroom and inserted the tub that way.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44576" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="Bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h4>Sweeten lends advice and support</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I appreciated that the Sweeten team was approachable and knowledgeable about my first-timer renovator questions. The team hopped on a call to discuss potential contractors and provided useful tips on how to make the hiring decision. They also frequently checked in during the renovation and were available for help as needed.  </span></p>
<h3>Renovation tips: Budget and expectations</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re renovating—even for a junior one bedroom—plan on it taking more time and money than you anticipate—there are always unexpected things that happen as you go through the process. We ended up spending roughly 25% more than the original budget since we added change orders to address issues that came up. Decide on your renovation “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves” and stick with them. It’s a dusty business, so live somewhere else during a gut renovation, if possible, and invest in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air purifier and a professional cleaning</a> afterward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t feel pressured to decorate everything right after you move in. Be patient, live with the apartment for a while with existing items, and figure out what you need. Also, buy vintage furniture if you can! </span><span class="s1">Now our new space finally feels like home :) </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Claire and Dan, for sharing your very first renovation with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Slide right into a more flexible living space with these renovations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walls and doors are losing popularity in the era of open-plan living, but what if you could have the best of both worlds? Imagine a space that is open to the rest of your home—or closed off—depending on your mood. Enter the sliding door: a feature that takes up minimal floor space and blends into its surroundings when not in use, becoming an architectural detail in the home. Whether you prefer the rustic feel of a barn or the simple elegance of French doors, these Sweeten homeowners will inspire you to create a home with disappearing borders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33691 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-white-living-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" alt="white barn door in a white living room with wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A classic barn door separates the living room from the bedroom in Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment combination</a>. Painting the door white to match the nearby walls allows it to blend into the background, while black hardware adds contrast with a modern twist.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-34-35.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25786 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-36-38.gif" alt="sliding doors, office doors, natural light " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While not in use as an entryway, a pair of sliding doors gives Larry the option to watch a game on the TV in the adjoining lounge from inside his <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-renovation-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office</a>. The doors also increase the flow of natural light into the windowless room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" alt="sliding doors, open floor plan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sliding doors in Ana and Leo&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-plan apartment</a> connect the dining area to the office when open, and transform the office into a guest bedroom when closed. In lieu of a traditional door, the oversized panels allow them to combine both rooms into one big space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22102 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="sliding doors, open space, privacy " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing a barn door with three store-bought doors together in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dining area</a> (and painting it in the same color as the surrounding walls—Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore) makes it possible for Lauren and Ross to hide the study when they want to create a more intimate space.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="sliding doors, french doors, pocket doors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-nyc-homecoming-prompts-a-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexible living space</a>, Margery and Jim planned to separate the guest bedroom from the kitchen with a pair of sliding doors. Instead of going for a simple set of barn-style doors, the couple&#8217;s general contractor fused together two salvaged French doors the couple found at an estate sale and built them into a pocket door. When opened, the entire wall disappears. Magic!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sweeten&#8217;s top 10 reno trends we predict will continue strong</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33607 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home design trends for 2018" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1-723x723.jpg" alt="home design trends for 2018" width="723" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovators this year embraced trends new and old, from fresh takes to a more classic approach. Read on to see what made the cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29449 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-brick-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" alt="white barn door near brick wall and large window and brown floor tiles after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SLIDING DOORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A door can be more than just an entry from one room to another; it can take an open plan apartment and turn it into multiple, private spaces. Sliding doors add flexibility to spaces of all sizes, making rooms magically appear as if out of thin air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/">Miguel</a> got rid of a wall of closets and relocated the storage to the bedroom, installing a wardrobe on rollers that could also function as a door; glass-paneled partitions allowed <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/">Sarah and Craig</a> to create a second bedroom in their apartment without blocking the light from a wall of windows; to transition their office into a guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/">Ana and Leo</a> opted for a set of white, sliding doors that have the appearance of a solid wall when closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29453 size-chrono" title="walls turned into peninsulas" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" alt="walls turned into peninsulas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WALLS-TURNED-PENINSULA</h3>
<p>“Where there’s a wall, there’s a way” isn’t technically a saying, but it works well to describe how homeowners have been opening up their kitchens by chopping a wall in half. The move makes your kitchen feel much larger and boosts prep, storage, and dining space.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/">Lisa and Chris’</a> tiny kitchen, the close walls made it feel tight and restricted—until they turned one wall into a peninsula; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/">Kaija and John</a> did the same in their space and topped it with a poured concrete countertop; and so did <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/">Dan and Mike</a>, adding stylish wood paneling for a touch of contrast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29469 size-chrono" title="gray-bedroom-blue-bedcover" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" alt="gray bedroom with blue bedcover and gray fireplace after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>MULTI-COMFORT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Air quality/Soundproofing)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, the most comfortable elements of your home are the least noticeable, like air conditioning that keeps the summer heat at bay or soundproofing that elevates the coziness factor in bedrooms. When you’re thinking of new features to add to your home, like hardwood flooring or a marble countertop, don’t forget to make comfort a priority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new HVAC system found a spot at the top of the renovation checklist in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> 130-year-old brownstone; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/deniz-ramons-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deniz and Ramon</a> added soundproofing to two walls in their kitchen to prevent noise from leaking into the bedroom; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/original-details-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah</a> chose solid core doors for the nursery so her girls can snooze away while she entertains right outside their door.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29446 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wall-Hung-Toilet.gif" alt="Wall-Hung-Toilet" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>WALL-HUNG TOILETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The toilet may not be the prettiest feature, but no bathroom is complete without one. When it comes to selecting one for your space, wall-hung toilets have a lot going for them, from the nearly non-existent footprint to the ease of cleaning below and around the unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix’s</a> Scandinavian-styled powder room, the wall-hung toilet blends in seamlessly with her minimal design; the unit in <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed’s</a> downstairs bathroom fades into the background so that the classic trough sink can take center stage; and in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-injects-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith and Jason’s</a> small master bath, the toilet takes up very little room, allowing them to gain back seven inches of floor space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29448 size-chrono" title="white-open-book-shelf-large-window" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" alt="white open book shelf near large window and breakfast nook with white round table and brown wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SKIM COATING</h3>
<p>Although the process costs more than a simple color change, skim coating greatly improves the appearance of walls. Think of it as stretching a fresh piece of canvas for your masterpiece instead of painting on top of an older artwork.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/">Cat and Jordan</a> took this extra step to reach the goal of making their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible”; the walls that weren’t demo&#8217;ed in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/">Sam and Sean’s</a> kitchen got a much-needed facelift; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio, she followed her contractor’s advice to skim coat the walls and ceiling to repair the uneven surface and hide bowed beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29454 size-chrono" title="patterned-hexagon-black-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" alt="patterned hexagon black floor tiles and a gray vanity in a bthroom with white subway tiles after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PATTERNED FLOOR TILE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bathroom design doesn’t have to be boring; patterned floor tile brings color and interest, regardless of square footage. Go for the unexpected with contrasting grout, a pop of color, or a new twist on classic stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> took inspiration from their favorite New York restaurant bathrooms with black hex tile and white grout; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin and Brian</a> chose a colorful blue mosaic tile; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> took marble to another level with a graphic basketweave pattern.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29470 size-chrono" title="white-bathroom-beige-vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" alt="white bathroom tiles in a large bathroom with beige floating vanity and white double sink after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SEPARATE (OR SHARED) BATHROOMS FOR COUPLES</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you have two bathrooms or just one master, designing a stylish space to meet the needs of two people is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/">Leslie</a> combined two bathrooms in her home to create a large, luxurious space and installed an extra-wide mirror and double sink vanity; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/">Cecilia and Jonathan&#8217;s</a> individual bathrooms, Cecilia wanted a bright, classic space, and incorporated plenty of marble, while Jonathan used stone to make his space resemble a spa; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/">Meg and Brett</a> went with a Kohler slop sink for two circa 1948 and a custom vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29460 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" alt="blue kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white subway tiled backsplash and a small kitchen island after renovation" width="723" height="483" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>BLUE KITCHEN CABINETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping kitchens cool is as simple as adding the color blue. In Victorian times, it was believed that a touch of blue in the wall paint would help regulate the room’s temperature. Although the motivation has changed, this moody hue has made a triumphant return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> redesigned their kitchen with navy cabinets painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore; mixing white and blue cabinets add a layer of depth to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mollie&#8217;s</a> space; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire and Mike</a> selected Evening Dove by Benjamin Moore, a bold color choice, which helps define the kitchen from the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29463 size-chrono" title="waterfall countertops" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" alt="waterfall countertops" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WATERFALL COUNTERTOPS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing is more elegant in the kitchen than a waterfall counter. The look elevates an island from a purely functional piece into a sculptural feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/">Amy and Nick</a> splurged on Carrara marble for their kitchen showpiece; <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/">Alicia and Ed</a> refined the edge of their peninsula with a Caesarstone counter in Statuario Nuvo; Carrara marble made another appearance in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/">Lia and Chris&#8217;</a> space to cap the end of the U-shaped layout, a suggestion from their Sweeten contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29471 size-chrono" title="large-white-paneled-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" alt="large white paneled cabinets for refrigerator after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PANELED REFRIGERATORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t want your refrigerator to be the focal point of your kitchen? Disguise it with custom paneling and let the other features of your space shine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley and Simon&#8217;s</a> contractor proposed tucking their fridge into an existing column; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David</a> concealed their appliances among flat-front cabinets; to preserve the classic design of her prewar apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia</a> chose custom paneling trimmed with molding.</p>
<p><em>Of course, we love ALL Sweeten renovations and are excited to help homeowners renovate fearlessly in the New Year!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah and Craig, along with their two shelter pets, Willie (the cat) and Quincy (the dog), had lived in a rather tiny 700-square-foot Manhattan apartment for four years. When they moved into a modern Long Island City condo in 2013, the 1,160-square-foot one-bedroom felt like the Great Plains. “Initially, we were so thrilled to have so much space that we didn’t think about improving it,” said Sarah. Over time, ideas for possible tweaks, refinements, and overall improvements began jumping out at them. Among the wish list: creating a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second bedroom</a>, revamping the bathrooms, and harnessing the potential of a few pockets of what seemed like dead space. But the thing that ultimately motivated Sarah and Craig (particularly Craig) was the disproportionately small kitchen sink—a big, white farmhouse sink they had their eye on seemed a much better fit for their large apartment. “We like to joke that our entire renovation started with the kitchen sink,” said Sarah.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted general contractors, to locate a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-build firm</a>. Rather than get design help from a general contractor or hire a designer and a contractor separately, a design-build firm brings it all together in one organization. “Many contractors claim to offer this when they are really loose associations of separate companies,” said Sarah. “<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten contractors</a> were a one-stop shop—a true design-build firm under one roof.” The aesthetic Sarah and Craig wanted was what they coined “industrial eclectic.” The goal: preserve the industrial history of Long Island City while adding some of the couple’s own rustic taste.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s dark cabinetry was swapped out for a bright white that, of course, complemented that big, white farmhouse sink. In order to make the kitchen and living room into two distinct areas, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> was extended into something of a casual dining area that was ideal for pre-dinner drinks or a meal for a low-key evening at home. Fortunately for this couple, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer unit</a> already existed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah and Craig’s Sweeten contractors really excelled when it came to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximizing storage space</a> in the kitchen. Their designer installed sliding shelves in the lower kitchen counters “that slide out so we can easily access our pots and pans.” New custom cabinets were also added to the inside of the now-larger kitchen island. Their contractor team also designed and built a tall cabinet separate from the kitchen that became a home for spices along with the couple’s miniature herb garden. One of the highlights of the new design is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar area</a>. A small nook of dead space fit a wine fridge perfectly, while the wooden carving on the shelf above the racks of wine and beer naturally reads “Cheers.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dividing the large living room into a second bedroom and living area was one of the improvements the couple envisioned. They placed the additional room where they did because of the rectangular shape but didn’t want to block the natural light coming in from the bank of windows. Sliding doors were their solution and their Sweeten contractor went to work designing a custom set. Not only were they able to increase storage space in the bathrooms and kitchen, other areas became additional places to stow stuff. A small closet was added to a newly minted second bedroom, including enough space for a double bike rack, and the master bedroom welcomed a new closet. “Before the project, we were constantly looking for places to stash our clutter,” said Sarah. “Now, everything has a home.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On to the two bathrooms. The original style was a little bland for the couple’s taste, so they updated with new tiles and fixtures. Rather than the original off-white tiles, they chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bold pattern</a> that was more fun. The Steampunk-style lights surrounding the mirrors in either bathroom added a rustic feel to the space, as did the distressed finish of the vanities. The toilets became a momentary problem. A rear-outlet toilet was needed because of the plumbing in their building. This meant a smaller selection to choose from. However, the couple’s contractor “searched tirelessly, high and low, to find a rear-outlet toilet that would work in our space and fit our look,” said Sarah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, Sarah and Craig found that their Sweeten contractors “struck a perfect balance between owning the project and involving us in the creative decision-making process,” said Sarah. &#8220;Everything went smoothly once we were connected with our contractor, so we&#8217;re happy to report we never had to engage the Sweeten client services team!&#8221; A slight hiccup developed when an exterior wall issue was spotted, holding up the project. However, the team worked hard to get back on track and for the entire renovation, the couple was able to rent a studio apartment from someone else in their building. All in all, the renovation took four months. “Without that trust [in our Sweeten&#8217;s], the experience would have been much more stressful,” said Sarah.</p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing how you&#8217;ve made your new apartment into a home, Sarah and Craig.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An architect dodged a shady general contractor in the nick of time and ended up with a perfect Sweeten home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22" width="1000" height="706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Tribeca homeowner and architect Ana</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>

<p>Although open-concept living has become the norm, most homes still need a <i>few</i> doors here and there to provide privacy and to delineate spaces. And while you might not have given it much thought, there’s a lot to consider when choosing interior doors. Read on for an in-depth look at the right questions to ask, material and feature options, and the costs associated with inside entryways.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors before buying interior doors</strong></h3>
<h4>Interior door soundproofing</h4>
<p>This may vary depending on the location and the kind of spaces that need to be closed off. Interior doors come with a “sound transmission class” (STC) rating, which measures the level of sound loss. The higher the number, the greater the sound buffer.</p>
<h4><strong>Are you painting or staining your interior door?</strong></h4>
<p>Your answer will help you narrow down the type of materials you consider, since only certain types can be stained (see below). If you plan to paint, you can choose from the full range of options.</p>
<h4><strong>Do you need a door slab or a pre-hung door?</strong></h4>
<p>This depends on whether there is an existing frame: a slab is the door itself, and a pre-hung includes all of the installation parts, including the frame, hinges, and knob. Slabs are cheaper.</p>
<h4><b>Simple styles are easier on budgets</b></h4>
<p>Simpler styles tend to be less expensive (think minimalist slab versus ornate multi-panels) when all else is equal.</p>
<h4>Costs for interior doors</h4>
<p>Interior door costs span as low as $25, to a headier $1,000 or more; so having a target budget will narrow your field to a more manageable set of choices.</p>
<h3><b>Interior door materials</b></h3>
<p>Several kinds of materials are available to achieve the practicality and the look that you want. In rough order of cost from least to most expensive, doors can be hollow core, solid core, solid wood, or metal. Within the selection of both hollow core and solid core, there are molded or MDF options.</p>
<h4><strong>Hollow core interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>This means that the interior of the door is filled with cardboard baffle or another similar light material. Given the inexpensive construction, they are very affordable but do little to prevent any sound transfer or provide insulation. They are not optimal for fire safety, and are easily dented but good for paint-grade applications. Starts at $25.</p>
<h4><strong>Solid core interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>These doors are made of composite wood on the interior, with a wood veneer on the exterior. Composites are extremely dense, and therefore heavier than a solid wood door. High-density limits sound transfer, making them an excellent fit for bathrooms and bedrooms. Sometimes, a solid core door can be made of a single slab of more affordable wood, such as pine, that is faced with a more expensive wood, such as teak. Other notable qualities are their durability and weather resistance. Solid core doors can be painted or stained. Starts at $50, but averages around $200.</p>
<h4><strong>Molded doors</strong></h4>
<p>These doors are created from fiberglass or wood byproducts that have been molded to look like wooden doors. They can be either hollow or solid core. Good for painting, but not suitable for staining. Ranges from $20 to $150.</p>
<h4><strong>MDF doors</strong></h4>
<p>Medium-density fiberboard (&#8220;MDF&#8221;) is an engineered wood product. Generally considered higher quality than molded doors, they are also heavier, block sound better, and come in either hollow or solid core. Also good for painting, but not suitable for staining. Starts at $30.</p>
<h4><strong>Solid wood interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>This type of door is made entirely from natural wood. Depending on the species of tree, the wood can range widely in terms of sound transfer. Pine, for example, is lightweight compared to mahogany, which is very heavy, and thus a sound-deadening option. They tend to be the most expensive option and can be more customizable. They are more susceptible to changes in climate. Solid wood is easily painted, stained, or left as is for a more rustic look. Starts at $100, but averages around $500 to $1,000 for quality hardwood.</p>
<h4><strong>Metal interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>Metal doors are rare for interiors, but are increasingly popular. They tend to be made of steel and glass and create an industrial or loft-like feel to separate an office or library space. They are the heaviest option and may even require reinforcing to make sure that the surrounding frame can withstand the weight. While they don’t dent easily, they do scratch. Metal can be painted. Starts at $100, but can run into the thousands of dollars.</p>
<h3><b>Features and options for interior doors</b></h3>
<p>Numerous configurations achieve different goals: some doors can accentuate a space while others minimize attention to an awkward spot. You can keep it simple with a single point of entry or double up for a more dramatic look.</p>
<h4><strong>The basic, single door</strong></h4>
<p>When going with a single door, you will need to decide how you want it to open (called “door handing”)—choosing from left-hand or right-hand options. Keep in mind that, to keep paths clear, doors should not open into hallways. This handy<a href="https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/doors-windows/door-handing.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/doors-windows/door-handing.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1488377178472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcTD1DrnzdoqUARuwTd0m7blv4ew" rel="noopener"> diagram</a> tells you what is what (it can be kind of confusing!). Double doors are either center-swing or sliding.</p>
<h4><strong>Choose style and function for your door</strong></h4>
<p>You can also consider double entryways, commonly referred to as French doors, which have glass panes down their full length, a great option for connecting two rooms you might want to be open to each other. Other options are sliding features, like a sliding panel that slides across the surface of the wall behind it (and remains visible). Alternately, pocket doors disappear into the wall when opened. Bi-fold doors (also known as folding) are traditionally used for closet spaces, but glass versions can also be used to open a living space up to the outdoors. You could also opt for ones that are louvered, which allows air and some light to pass through its slats. And while not commonly seen in many homes, there’s no reason you couldn’t have a Dutch door in your kitchen! While these more unusual options will not be as effective at blocking sound transfer, they will certainly add more character than a typical single door.</p>
<h3><strong>Weight and size of interior doors</strong></h3>
<p>Lastly, in terms of dimensions, interior doors come in four levels of thickness and three widths. The thinnest is 1 3/8 inches, then 1 1/2, 1 5/8, with the thickest 1 3/4 inches. They range from 28 to 32 inches wide, and are usually 80 inches in height. Closet openings can be just 78 inches tall, so they will also usually be widely available. If you have a frame already in place, you’ll need to ensure that your new slab matches the existing dimensions.</p>
<p>Given the variety of options to choose from, first narrowing it down in terms of the most important criterion (such as soundproofing capability or cost) will help to streamline the process.</p>
