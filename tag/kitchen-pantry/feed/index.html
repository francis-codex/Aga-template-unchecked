<h3>Renovation plan: living in the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To say I won the real estate lottery might feel like an overstatement, but after a short hunt, I found a Brooklyn Heights co-op in a 1920s building. It had everything I had been looking for—two bedrooms, a corner unit, lots of windows, high ceilings, and a single block from multiple subway stations. The only drawback was that the place needed a lot of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before moving in I did some things that really needed doing: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting in new hardwood floors</a>, fully gutting the original bathroom, and installing updated electrical and lighting. At the time, the idea of touching the kitchen was out of the question—and budget. But it was, thankfully, the newest portion of the apartment and didn’t necessarily need work yet. It also had a weird layout that didn’t exactly scream a clear solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I had a plan for my remodel. The key was living in the apartment long enough to come up with the right solution before demolition started.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31285 size-feature" title="happy-homeowner-renovated-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait-936x667.jpg" alt="happy homeowner in a renovated kitchen" width="936" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Planning the new kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I knew I wanted a kitchen that felt open to the living room with lots of storage (this is NYC). I also wanted a new layout that still provided some sort of entryway and coat closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as I moved in, I began thinking about and talking about my most recent, “brilliant” plan for the kitchen layout to friends and family. First, I was set on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an island, then a peninsula</a>, and then I thought about moving the plumbing. I realized that I had to narrow down what was (and wasn’t) working for the kitchen.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg" alt="blue cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-31162 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>They created a sleek bookshelf that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout technically had a lot of counter prep space, but it was in two separate areas, so I often had my back to my guests while I cooked. I loved the giant coat closet within the “entry,” but keeping it meant my options were limited. The appliances were in decent shape, though oversized for the space. A weird drop ceiling over part of the kitchen made it feel disconnected from the rest of the living room. This ceiling, coupled with a half-height wall that separated the front door from the kitchen, made the kitchen feel smaller than it actually was.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31159" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding a drop ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five years and probably quite a few exasperated friends and co-workers later, I settled on a plan for the kitchen. There would be no island and no peninsula. Everything was out from floor-to-ceiling. The huge coat closet was partially removed to make room for custom cabinets, panel-ready appliances, and a new drop ceiling that mirrored the curve of the floor transition from new tile to my existing hardwood floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the coat closet gone, I decided to expand the closet in my bedroom to make up for the lost space. Aesthetically, I’ve always loved blue cabinets and knew that I wanted to do darker kitchen cabinets with a lighter floor and a whiter countertop with some wood accents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I chose a separate cooktop and oven because the space I had for the stove was much deeper than a traditional countertop and I wanted to take full advantage of the space I had. I also wanted the appliances to look seamless and fully integrated. Plus, I hate the weird space that always happens between a stove and the cabinet where dirt and food collects.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31165 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Two prep zones</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get more workable counter space, I moved the stove to another wall. The original location of the refrigerator was a perfect spot. The sink remained on its original wall and was centered in order to get counter space on either side and keep it close to the cooktop/oven. By doing this, I <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/5-things-we-can-learn-about-kitchen-zones-from-this-diagram-kitchen-design-lessons-216828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created two zones for prep</a> on each side of the sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I made the decision about the sink and cooktop/oven, I knew that the old coat closet had to be downsized to make room for the refrigerator. I opted for a panel-ready refrigerator because I felt like opening the front door and having a seamless wall of cabinetry would help mitigate the fact that you were walking right into the kitchen. Functionally, I was also trying to create a triangle between my sink, cooktop/oven, and the refrigerator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just to the left of the refrigerator happened to be the perfect location for a pantry. I had some built-in, pull-out drawers earmarked for my pots and pans and a simple pull-out wire drawer (it was super easy to install!) for my pantry items. With storage, food, and the refrigerator covered, I used the remaining space to the right of the refrigerator to create a new coat closet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-31169 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Seamless transition between kitchen and living area</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the way my apartment “boundaries” were, there was a funny niche on the TV wall into which a counter and cabinets were installed. With the new design, there&#8217;s storage below where my microwave and toaster oven live and “open” storage above to display my pretty kitchen items. The glass doors open and can be tucked away so the countertop can be used as a bar top for parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also wanted to have a place to eat. By pushing my living room furniture closer to the window, I made room for a new dining table and chairs. I had the pendant lights installed over the table. Extra work had to be done to build out the beam in the ceiling to hide the electrical boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like the kitchen design, the idea of a built-in at the window had been on my mind since I bought the apartment. With a millworker already doing custom cabinets, I figured the built-in should be done as well. A sleek bookshelf was created that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows. I selected a “piano” finish on the top of the bookshelf for easy cleanup. I’m looking forward to exercising my hopefully-green thumb.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-31170 " style="font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Consider all possibilities</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I optimistically planned for a “quick” two-month renovation, during which I lived in the second bedroom with all my possessions and a microwave. Of course, it took almost three months before I could move back into my own bedroom, and another two months before the project finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My advice for anyone preparing for a renovation: take your time. Do your research; debate all the possibilities. It was better to wait and mull over all my plans (for years!) before making the investment. Using Sweeten helped with the process of finding a contractor. I appreciated being able to read references and see photos of previous projects, which helped me see the quality of each contractor’s work.</p>
<h3>Brighter and more functional home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-do-architects-renovate-their-own-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovating my own space as an architect</a> was good and bad: good because I knew what I wanted and how to articulate it to the contractor. But also bad, or rather tricky, because I knew exactly what I wanted and expected a specific level of quality and detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final result was worth the discomfort and occasional tears. I’m incredibly happy with my new space. The kitchen is so bright and open,  and the layout is functional with tons of storage. Bonus: I was even able to make space for a proper dining table! Now, instead of talking to my friends about renovating, we talk about about the next time they’re coming for dinner.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26915" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" alt="open pantry Sweeten kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Function and fashion are two major factors to consider while planning for a home renovation. While we want our homes to be aesthetically pleasing, we also need them to be more efficient, organized and less cluttered. The solution? Integrating unique features into your home renovation designs can solve organizational challenges while looking beautiful and distinct.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></span>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, shows how Sweeten homeowners have used unique features in their renovations to inject beauty-and function-into their homes.</p>
<h3><strong>Jewelry wall: A major upgrade from boxes and bowls</strong></h3>

<p> <em>(Above)</em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tina + Andrew&#8217;s</a> shiny Sunnyside jewelry wall, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deanne + Daria&#8217;s</a> closed-door accessory storage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tina and Andrew combined two closets in the master bedroom into a walk-in closet—“a rare thing in New York City!”—they opted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include a jewelry wall</a> that functioned as a unique feature for display and storage. The narrow shelf underneath adds a subtle component that provides space for decorative touches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siblings Deanna and Daria share a Grandmillenial-chic aesthetic, so it’s only fitting that <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even their jewelry wall</a> is hidden behind an old-school mirrored door. Inside, there’s plenty of room for statement necklaces, earrings, and rings, in keeping with the sisters’ more-is-more sensibility.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Toe kick drawers maximize every square inch</strong></h3>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44541 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jessica-Home-11.jpeg" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jessica-Home-11.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jessica-Home-11-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jessica-Home-11-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica + Jessie&#8217;s</a> jewel-toned drawers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elie and Matt waited before <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovating their kitchen</a> to make sure that they could fully maximize the 7&#215;7 space to suit their needs. When they decided to take the leap, they opted for custom cabinets that included toe-kick drawers as unique features to get more storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica and Jesse, both major foodies, knew they needed a “beautiful kitchen to cook in.” To that end, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-engineered the space</a> to incorporate a six-foot island with a lot of cool features, and toe-kick drawers are one of the stars.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Above-sink drying rack = natural space saver</strong></h3>

<p><em>(Above)</em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giulia&#8217;s</a> nostalgic dish rack, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/product-designer-sutton-place-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jo&#8217;s</a> efficient drying rack</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Giulia’s plan for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a “functional” kitchen</a>, she knew she wanted a drying rack shelf above the sink, an idea she says she “stole” from Italy, her home country. The rack’s placement not only frees up counter space; it prevents the dreaded “puddles of standing water.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jo’s kitchen renovation aimed to create <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/product-designer-sutton-place-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a clean, classic space</a> while incorporating ideas from her travels and innovative materials. A bamboo drying rack above the sink—something Jo had seen in Europe—was sealed to accommodate wet dishes and provides an earthy counterpoint to the white cabinetry.</span></p>

<h2><strong>An open pantry, a cook’s best friend</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" alt="open pantry, kitchen pantry, walk in pantry, kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above)</em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nazli&#8217;s</a> seamless walk-in pantry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Nazli’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-plan kitchen</a>, she opted to forgo upper cabinets, a storage challenge she solved with an open pantry. Although a great solution for seeing and accessing ingredients easily, it can also lead to visual clutter. Nazli avoided that pitfall by painting the pantry a dark gray, which “makes the whole space disappear” once the light is turned off.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>When Fabio and Melina won the bidding war on a two-bedroom Carnegie Hill apartment, they were amazed and delighted. With outdoor space, family-friendly amenities, and just one block from the new Second Avenue subway, it checked off all the right boxes. The only downside: it needed a thorough facelift and the clock was ticking on their rental apartment. Oh, and their baby was due any minute. Here’s how they juggled the ups and downs of renovating, while learning to be new parents—Melina gave birth to their son a month into the project!</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22047 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by Carnegie Hill homeowner Melina </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the lease of our functional but tiny, 550 square-foot, one-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side about to end and a baby boy on the way, the time came to try and buy a place. We set our hopes on a two-bedroom apartment in our neighborhood, ideally with great light and storage space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward three months into our search and there were still no prospects. We were starting to lose hope! We went to every open house around us and looked at all options. Many of the apartments we visited were too expensive, too small, too dark, or way too far from any subway or daycare, which was our desired childcare plan. That is, until we visited a listing two blocks south of our rental and a block from the entrance of the new Second Avenue subway–whose opening, at the time, still sounded like a dream far in the future. The apartment itself was falling apart and looked straight out of “That ‘70s Show.” Only one family had occupied the home since the building was built 40 years ago, and no renovations had ever been done. Most of its walls were painted green, the living room had an entire wall covered in mirrors, and a popcorn ceiling ran throughout. However, the space was promising. A true two-bedroom on a high floor, with a large balcony off the living room, light (windows in every room!), and closet space. It came with basement storage, a bike room, a children’s playroom in-the-making, and a roof deck. Our only reservation was the need for a full renovation before moving in. Despite that, we made an offer, thinking we wouldn’t win the bidding war anyway. To our surprise, our best and almost unreasonable offer did.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22036 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02-1-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02 (1)" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21972 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/floorplan-2-600x516.jpg" alt="floorplan (2)" width="600" height="516" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We found Sweeten on an online search and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6445">posted our project </a>to be matched with builders. We were nervous about finding a contractor who could understand our expectations and timing constraints. The lease on our rental was ending before the summer, and so our move-in date was not flexible. We had less than four months to complete our entire renovation project. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177">our Sweeten contractor</a> because we immediately felt we could trust him in getting the job done in time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21973 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21976 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21974 size-chrono" title="farmhouse sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-13" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21975 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus for our renovation was the kitchen and bathroom. Fabio and I both love to cook and wanted a space where we could work together at the same time. The small bathroom needed to feel less cluttered and gain storage space. Our contractor provided decisive support, validated our suggestions, and helped to define the details before starting the work. We wanted to make this apartment our own, and he was happy to accommodate our choices, but he also made sure they were practical. As soon as we closed on the apartment, the team went in and started the demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before construction, we spent a lot of time pulling together the look and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view on the style we were trying to achieve. Our material choices included Carrara marble, cement and ceramic tile, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and black and white cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We opened up the kitchen entryway slightly to let additional light come through to the dining area. We opted for countertops on opposite sides to maximize prep space and to accommodate a full semi-professional espresso setup—Fabio is a coffee geek. Our Sweeten contractor helped us finalize our design with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We spend a great deal of time in the kitchen and didn’t want strong colors we may grow tired of quickly, and settled on black cabinets with patterned ceramic floor tiles to add interest. While we tried to stay within our budget as much as possible, we splurged on professional heavy-duty appliances. We went with a modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased copper cabinet pulls online. The new kitchen is fantastic—the storage space feels especially luxurious compared to our previous kitchens.</p>

<p>We kept the bathroom’s tub and had it re-enameled but replaced the sink, cabinetry, hardware, and had the floor and walls retiled. We used a gold, black and white color theme that coordinated with the light fixtures and cement floor tiles. To create storage space, we built a new partially recessed medicine cabinet hidden behind the door. There was no heat in the bathroom, and with long New York winters in mind, we added a small towel heater.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The flooring throughout the apartment needed to be replaced, and our contractor took us to his supplier for a selection of inexpensive but great-looking wood flooring. We went with a light-colored wood with dark veins to generate an interesting contrast. The shelves in the rooms’ closets were falling apart. Initially, we planned on using IKEA shelving to replace them but because they weren’t standard size, we had them custom-designed by <a href="https://www.californiaclosets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Closets</a> to optimize our storage space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21986 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>Our son was born one month into the renovation, and we were able to trust our contractor and his colleagues to handle the work with limited supervision. As with most renovation projects, some of our plans fell through unexpectedly, but our contractor and his team made sure we stayed on track and resolved every issue quickly and efficiently. The renovation has been complete for almost a year, and we could not be happier with our new apartment. Thanks to our contractor and Sweeten, we got our dream home and moved in on schedule.</p>
<p>Thank you Melina and Fabio for sharing how a renovation can be completed with grace under time constraint. We hope you continue to enjoy your home!</p>
