<h3>Getting organized for a new home</h3>
<p>Buying and renovating a fixer-upper is one way to attain both the desired square footage and location at a more affordable price. If you are buying with the intent to renovate, cost is not the only item to consider. Use your time efficiently by syncing the construction timeline with the closing schedule. When do you bring in the architect and general contractor?</p>
<p>Here, Sweeten offers a practical guide to juggling a purchase PLUS a renovation. <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1000px-Graph-Timeline-new.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to download our guide.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h4>Bidding on the home you want</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Speak with a mortgage broker or lender</strong></span> (1 – 3 weeks) Determine how you want to pay for your renovation. A construction-to-permanent loan allows you to finance your renovation as part of your mortgage application in one go versus two separate processes.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hire a real estate attorney</strong></span> (3 days – 2 weeks)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Find your new home and make an offer</strong></span> (1 – 4 months) Take into consideration how much of a reno budget you’ll have after the purchase. On the reno front, decide the time/budget of what you can afford. (Don’t forget about closing costs; your agent and attorney can guide you on the cost range.) Keep in mind how long you want to carry a property after closing. You will most likely be paying for housing elsewhere unless you plan on roughing it in the unrenovated space.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negotiate the offer</span></strong> (2 days – 2 weeks) In the meantime, read up on how much labor and materials cost, along with the average home renovation costs on Sweeten&#8217;s blog. You can get a head start filling out your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project details on Sweeten</a> to better understand what you need. ie) alteration agreement, building insurance requirements, space dimensions for the renovation). Then, post your project after you close on your property.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Inspect and sign the contract</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schedule and conduct an inspection</span></strong>, if applicable. In a competitive market, this is a contingency a buyer may choose to forgo to make their bid more attractive. This can also be done while negotiating the offer (1 – 2 days). If you’re buying to renovate, you’ll want to know what will be possible to change, given existing conditions. You may not care whether the appliances are working or if the walls are orange. However, you’ll want to know about the state of the electrical and plumbing systems and if upgrading them is possible. The inspection will provide additional insight into the condition of the apartment and the building.</li>
<li>If you plan on moving walls, you’ll need an architect or a designer.</li>
<li>Get a heads-up about other financial or building issues. If the inspector tells you the apartment building needs a new roof or boiler, for example, look into whether there will be an assessment levied or if money has already been raised. With an assessment, you’ll bear the expense as the new owner. This may cut into your renovation budget. The same goes for a house: if there are pressing repairs, you’ll foot the whole bill.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Have your attorney conduct due diligence</span></strong> (2 weeks) At the same time, the attorney should also review the alteration agreement to make sure nothing prohibits you from the vision you have planned. ie) Checking the wet-over-dry rules if you plan to relocate the kitchen.</li>
<li>In a house, be certain zoning will allow the renovation plans you have. ie) If you’re in a landmarked district, you’ll be restricted in what you can do to the home’s exterior.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Start your general contractor search</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sign the contract to your new home</span></strong> (5 – 7 business days) Now’s the time to post your renovation project to Sweeten with details about your wish list, budget, and timeline. You’ll be matched to vetted general contractors based on scope, location, and budget. Review your contractors’ past work and testimonials.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apply for a mortgage and receive a commitment</span></strong> (3 – 6 weeks) Reach out to your contractor(s) and set up site visits. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547733600445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFf3D_3jxrQlCkBMCOPt2c_uyLllA">Here’s how to prepare for it</a>.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Complete and submit your co-op/condo application package</span></strong> (10 – 20 business days or within 3 days of receiving mortgage commitment)</li>
<li>Keep the conversation going and negotiate the terms of the renovation budget, timeline, and other contractual details with your Sweeten contractor. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547733600445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHNMr1b7gq5whQAAI2b3ocPvQvgw">Here’s a primer on how to evaluate different bids</a> (Sweeten can help you bid-level for free).</li>
<li>What are the contractors’ schedules for the coming quarter/6 months? Where would your project could fit in? You&#8217;ll want the contractor to start immediately after your closing date.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Board approval and begin your renovation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meet for a board interview</span></strong> (this can take anywhere from 1 week to a few months).</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Receive board approval</span></strong> (again, be prepared for a wait time from 1 week to a few months after the board interview).</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schedule a closing</span></strong> (2 weeks after approval). Once your closing is scheduled, let your general contractor know so that room can be made in the schedule for your project to begin. Also check out our article on <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/what-to-ask-a-general-contractor-before-renovating/">what to ask a GC before renovating</a>.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The keys to your new home are in hand!</strong></span> Sign the contract with your Sweeten contractor. If you’re in a condo or co-op, you’ll also need to get the renovation approved by the board.</li>
</ul>
<p>When buying and renovating a fixer-upper, some overlap exists between your renovation and your property purchase schedules. The bulk of the renovation process that happens prior to closing is prep work. Use this time to educate yourself about costs and processes. Begin the search for contractors and who would be the best fit for your project.</p>
<p>While you can lay this groundwork, don’t pull the trigger until you own the property (you never know what might happen!). <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So you’re in the process of buying a home and you&#8217;re already making renovation plans. Congratulations! This is an exciting time and we understand you&#8217;re eager to get going right away. Sweeten outlines the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of closing on a home and planning a renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>The big question: When&#8217;s the right time to start talking to contractors and design professionals?</h3>
<p><b></b><strong>A.</strong> When you make an offer?<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><strong>B.</strong> When you have an accepted offer?<br />
<strong>C.</strong> When you have an accepted offer and a deal sheet from your broker?<br />
<strong>D.</strong> When your attorney is preparing the contract and conducting a due diligence review of the property and building?<br />
<strong>E.</strong> When you have a signed contract and the deposit has changed hands?<br />
<strong>F.</strong>  After you close?<br />
<strong>G.</strong> When the condo, co-op board or town DOB approves the plans?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We talked to James Jantarasami, a New York attorney with expertise in housing and real estate to explore the question. James walked us through a few do’s and don&#8217;ts of buying a home and renovating.</p>
<h3>Own your property before finding a contractor.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DON’T</strong> shop around for a contractor before you have a place. Maybe this is obvious, but we sometimes see prospective owners jump the gun and try to interview contractors about a theoretical project. You will not be able to have a productive conversation with an architect, designer, or general contractor without knowing the exact details about the space you will be undertaking. Don’t start this conversation without an existing layout.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>DON’T</strong> look for a contractor at the offer stage. </span><span class="s1">An <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractor</a> can put together a detailed estimate in 1–2 weeks. Many will only commit to that pricing for 30 days. Therefore, finding a contractor at the offer stage is too early in the process. </span></p>
<h4>Start bid leveling when in contract</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are &#8220;in contract&#8221; to buy a place, you can bring your architect or contractor to take measurements and start planning. However, in order to begin the work, you’ll need certainty of ownership, confirmation of condo or co-op building requirements, and confirmation of your city or town&#8217;s department of buildings’ requirements. All building and city or town DOB requirements have to be satisfied whether you’re buying a condo, co-op, or a single-family home in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make the most of your time when “in contract,” since access to the home is readily available. Set up site visits with general contractors and receive at least three estimates. This will provide you with a low, medium, and high bid with some variation in services. Just as important, meeting multiple contractors allows you to view different personalities and to experience who would be the best fit as a collaborative partner. Sweeten’s </span><span class="s2">in-house team can provide personal support in breaking down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing renovation bids</a> (both Sweeten and non-Sweeten).</span></p>
<h3>Start your designing after contract</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DON’T</strong> start designing until, at a minimum, you are already in contract and the deposit has changed hands. Anything can happen between an accepted offer and a signed contract. You don’t want to spend money on design only to have the purchase fall through. The safest play is to wait until closing before you engage an architect or design pro. But, if you can’t wait, a signed contract at least gives you a reasonable expectation that you are going to own the property.</p>
<h3>Wait for the board approval process to complete</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DON’T</strong> touch anything until you have closed and formally own the property, have approval from your city or town’s DOB, and have made it through the approval process with the building’s board for co-op and condo purchases. No major alterations and no cosmetic changes until the deed changes hands and all paperwork is signed!</p>
<h3>Consider renovation costs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DO</strong> consider your home renovation plans before you make your offer. As a prospective purchaser, you can build the cost of the work needed into your offering price. <span class="s2">Check out Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation cost guides</a> to factor into your overall budget. </span><span class="s1"> Alternatively, ask the s</span>eller to handle some renovations or repairs before you close as part of the offer negotiation. However, keep in mind that this is rarely a viable option (unless the seller is a developer). Most sellers aren’t going to be interested in doing home renovation work prior to closing. Even if they are, you’ll have to be willing to wait potentially months for permits and sign-offs to be obtained prior to closing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your seller agrees to handle a few upgrades, you might save time and effort by letting them navigate the building’s and/or DOB’s requirements and completing the work before you close. The same goes if you&#8217;re purchasing a single-family home. But instead of dealing with a building&#8217;s requirements, the seller will only need to meet the DOB’s requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your seller agrees to a discount so that you can cover certain repairs or renovations, you’ll need to handle the logistics and wait until you close. Having control over the process means you and the seller can avoid disagreements over the quality of the renovated work.</p>
<h3>Plan for delays in the process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DO</strong> plan for delays and variables during the contract and closing process. Delays from the lender are one of the most common reasons a closing stalls. Condo and co-op board approvals can also add a month or more to your closing date, and you’ll still need approval from your city or town’s DOB. If you’re buying a single-family home, you’ll only need approval from the local DOB, so there’s one less step for you as the buyer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your attorney should be looking at everything that can go wrong: debts or liens against the seller, judgments or mortgages against the home, damage to the home that occurs between contract signing and closing (a water leak, floor or wall damage, appliance issues, etc.). If buying a condo or co-op, watch for any fiscal problems in a building’s financial reports that might spook the lender. Hopefully, none of these issues will derail the closing altogether, but you won’t be able to begin any work until all signatures are in.</p>
<h3>Will you need accommodations?</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>DO</b> budget for the in-between time. Since you can’t start home renovation work on a new home until you close, you may need to find another place to live while work is underway, or account for a period of time without rental income if you are renovating before tenants move in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So to recap, when can you start truly planning your renovation? The correct answer (in most cases) is E.  This means that generally, you can start:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Designing once you are in contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Building once you close and have official approval from your city or town’s DOB
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you have a co-op or condo, you will also need to get approval from your governing board</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’ve closed on a new place (congrats!) and are ready to find your general contractor, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> on Sweeten to get started!</p>
<p class="p1"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally. If you’re in the NY/NJ metro area, in-stock items typically deliver within 2-3 days.</p>
