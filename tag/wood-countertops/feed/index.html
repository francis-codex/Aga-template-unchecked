										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Butcher block brings warmth and workability—at a good value</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/">Kitchen countertop</a> material has a big impact on your space&#8217;s style and functionality. Not to mention, your budget. Luckily, butcher block delivers on all three. It has a natural look many homeowners love, along with durability and affordability. (Per square foot, wood starts at about $35, compared to $60 for granite and $100+ for marble.) Part of its appeal is the development of patina over time, though butcher block does require sanding and oiling to keep it in shape. See how these Sweeten homeowners incorporated wood countertops in their kitchens.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-20921 noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24613 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="butcher block counter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Butcher Block Countertops</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even with the tight layout of their galley kitchen, Kate and Daniel wanted a chef-worthy space. That&#8217;s why they chose butcher block countertops. Aside from the white quartz around the sink area (to prevent water stains on the wood), they made every surface prep-ready with cherry butcher block. The wood provides a nice contrast between the black cabinets and white subway tiled walls. Helping the couple strike the right balance of warm and cool tones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-20149 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20149 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="butcher block, countertops, home, design, renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. Built-In Prep Station</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A big focus of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Janet and Jerry’s</a> home renovation? The kitchen. They designed the space to be the most efficient space possible for cooking. First, they maximized storage with IKEA cabinetry and open shelves. Then, they went with two different countertop options: a mixed-material, sleek white surface and butcher block. The wood surface serves as the perfect chopping and prep station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-23889 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23889 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="butcher block, countertops, kitchen, home, design, renovcation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Butcher Block Bar</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly’s</a> studio apartment would always be a focal point, she “needed it to rock.” Along with her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten designer Courtney</a>, they transformed the space. They extended the cabinetry, replaced appliances, and updated finishes. Plus, a butcher block countertop adorned the new bar. This update met Kelly&#8217;s price point and brought in a natural element to her otherwise cool-toned kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-33521"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33521 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="butcher block, countertops, kitchen, home, design, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. Wooden Central Island</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/an-understated-kitchen-makes-a-big-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate and Graham</a> decided on a mostly white kitchen with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden appliances</a>. They wanted to make the kitchen feel integrated with the rest of their prewar home. Envisioning a room for family gathering, they added a central island—a perfect place for doing homework and preparing meals. More importantly, the island&#8217;s butcher block countertops tie-in nicely with the original (but newly sanded and stained) parquet floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-22342"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="butcher block, countertops, home, renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>5. Warm, Neutral Accents</h3>
<p>When <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/">Amanda and her husband</a> purchased their two-bedroom apartment, they knew the dark and closed-off kitchen would need an update. She envisioned a clean, bright space that didn’t feel too modern or sterile. The result: a harmonious mix of color and texture. Achieved thanks to butcher block counters, patterned tile floor, and white cabinets.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23095"><br />

</a>6. Natural Wood</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/">Sam and Sean’s</a> kitchen went from closed-off to open and sophisticated. The couple knocked-down walls and added refreshing design details. Specifically, the new island which connects their kitchen and living room. The island&#8217;s wooden countertops complement the other natural wood textures throughout the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>No New Yorker wants to leave a rent-stabilized apartment, so when a family of three came to us to help create beautiful space in a bigger place, we had to make sure they got an upgrade that made the move worthwhile.

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16387 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-kitchen.jpg" alt="sophia's upper west side kitchen renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-kitchen-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Sophia, Manhattan homeowner</span><span id="more-16382"></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For five years, I had been parked in a 400 square foot rent-stabilized apartment at a great location on the Upper West Side. As a single person, I felt like it was spacious. When my husband moved <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1178174334" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">in three years</span></span> ago, 400 square feet seemed &#8220;cozy,&#8221; and once I gave birth to our son, Apollo, the space became woefully inadequate. It just could not contain the mountain of stuff that accompanies caring for a baby.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We entered the Manhattan housing market and had a terrible time for a few months; we made several offers and were outbid on everything. All of the two-bedroom apartments within our price range were such wrecks that with construction costs included, they would have been over budget. Two things we knew for sure: we were determined to stay within our budget and I didn&#8217;t want anything that would need the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it. For the latter, as the saying goes, &#8220;famous last words&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Just when we were about to give up on our search, I decided to go to one last open house for a unit that had been on the market for months. Unbelievably, it was listed at a price that was within our budget and had three bedrooms, even larger than what we were originally hoping to get. It needed some work, but the maintenance was so low that we were convinced even with renovation costs, it would still be within our monthly budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The best part was thanks to an unusual catwalk outside the front door &#8212; the apartment actually received three exposures during the day and thus, a ton of light. But inside, it was similar to a “bento box” with lots of walls separating each of the living spaces and blocking all of that great light. The kitchen was dated and the whole thing needed to be gutted.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16388" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> after hearing from friends who had also found a general contractor on the website. We liked the ability to review candidates’ work online and we were extremely drawn to design-build companies for holistic decisions that would be more likely to contain costs. Sweeten introduced us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> and I was hooked on their work. I loved the design of their projects and after speaking with their references, we hired them immediately. We were able to get a running start designing the kitchen with Paulina while we were still in the process of closing. As soon as we closed, Paulina&#8217;s group was able to go in and start demolition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16389" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We went to see the apartment on the first day of demolition at the end of the day. As we stood there in the quiet dusk with the post-demolition dust slowly settling all around us, we both looked at each other with our mouths open…and in a moment of panic, I wondered if they could just put it all back the way it had been and pretend like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Once the debris cleared and the actual construction began, things were looking up. Bringing the dividing wall down between the kitchen and living room made a tremendous difference. Light poured in through the kitchen and into the hallways.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert custom-built the entire kitchen and it looks absolutely fantastic. We opted for classic white custom cabinets and we absolutely love the open shelving that Paulina incorporated per our request. The bookcase that transitions between the living room and kitchen was designed by her, and we love that it is a more natural ending point to the backsplash. Paulina persuaded us that wood countertops would require significant upkeep, so we opted instead for a simple quartz counter that has been great.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We tried to stay within our budget as much as possible and in doing so, decided to keep the perfectly fine (if dated) stove to hopefully be swapped out at a later date. Leon shopped with Paulina to find a narrower and more modern fridge and a new microwave that would match the width of the stove. Leon did the backlighting himself using an electronic LED strip that he controls through his phone. It can wirelessly connect and change colors to reflect the weather or the changes in the stock market. (<em>Editor’s note &#8212; ahem, what?? The stock market!?</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also went with a slightly more modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased our simple matte black pulls and handles from Ikea.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Our expert team was always professional during all of our interactions, even the ones when we were definitely playing the demanding and nervous first-time renovator role. I&#8217;m not sure we will ever do anything with the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it again, but this was a great first-time renovating experience and we are so happy in our new home!</p>
