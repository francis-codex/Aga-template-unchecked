<h3>A house flood sets off a new start</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sometimes you can spin a disaster into an opportunity. That’s what happened with Hildreth Place, our house in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition/">the Hamptons</a>. We used a devastating flood as a prompt to create a happy, modern home where family and friends can meet. </span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hildreth Place has been in the Garry family for more than 40 years, and my husband and I have owned it for 10. The house is in Hampton Bays, New York, 50 yards from Meschutt Beach, where families gather to swim in the bay and live music plays every night at Tiki Joes. The house was originally built in 1970, in a traditional Cape style. We have long used it with family, shared it with friends, and <a href="https://katygarry.com/pages/hildreth-place-landing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also rented it</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Two years ago, all of a sudden, a pipe froze and burst. After discovering eight feet of water in our basement, we decided to go down to the bones and renovate. Our goals were to make the home more efficient from both energy and maintenance standpoints, all while turning it into something beautiful that our family and friends can enjoy.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A new chapter for a family home</span></h3>
<p>Cara Boyce of <a href="http://www.redwagondesignny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Wagon Design</a> partnered with me on the interior design and helped me reimagine the home. <span class="s1">We planned to revise the façade, giving it the relaxed appearance of a modern farmhouse, and meanwhile use the interior redesign to solve problems and increase our living space. With Sweeten’s help, we found the perfect contractor to help us with our Hampton Bays home renovation. Accordingly, he worked on time and within budget, keeping cost savings in mind and brainstorming solutions to construction challenges. This house had a few!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-14.gif" alt="garage renovation as living space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49060" /></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hildreth Place has endured quite a bit, and we needed to prepare it for the future. The house has been standing 50 years, and is close to the beach and exposed to the elements. Consequently, our biggest investment was on exterior improvements. The materials needed to withstand the environment. For instance, we installed James Hardie <a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/siding/21072512/all-about-siding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clapboard on the exterior</a>, invested in a fiberglass front door, and chose fiberglass casement windows rather than old-school wood. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A garage renovation turns into a lounge space </span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One of the biggest interior changes we made in modernizing was on the home’s ground floor. The first floor was very traditional for a beach house, and the formal dining room, which was in the front of the house, wasn’t practical for entertaining.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">By raising the roofline, we were able to add about 200 square feet upstairs, creating space for a center hallway.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49055" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6.jpg" alt="gallery wall" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p1">We decided to create an open floor plan that connected the kitchen to a walk-through dining room. It continued out to our attached garage. With the garage renovation, we stole just under 300 square feet to create a new inside-outside room. As a result, this “garage room,” which opens to the back via an industrial-style roller door, lets the indoor space flow to the outdoors, and is an ideal casual gathering spot for coming off the beach.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the second floor, there was another flow blockage to overcome: We had four bedrooms, including a big dormer for the kids, but the only way to access that bunk room was through one of the other bedrooms. It was an awkward layout for children trying to find the bathroom at night. By raising the roofline, we were able to add about 200 square feet upstairs, creating space for a center hallway. As a result of the resectioning, we also found us space for a master bathroom, a nice bonus.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Personalizing with color and art</span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Seeing my murals and paintings transform the house has been incredible. The master bedroom got a bold, black-and-white brush-stroke mural. I love it! I have a moody painting tucked between the shelves in the master bath and oceany pieces in all the first-floor rooms. A guest room with a bright bamboo theme features a hand-painted ceiling by me and is inspired by colors that I’ve been gravitating to—the combination of orange, hot pink, and red makes me happy.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Down on the first floor in the powder room, just off the garage, we added wallpaper—this Dorothy Draper look was a <i>dream</i> of mine. The undeniably lush green print and chartreuse ceiling color is the kind of pairing that inspires me as an artist. Such a surprise when you open the door! My recommendation is to always spend money on things that give the most bang for the buck. I told my husband that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the splurgy wallpaper</a> was more important than running water.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many of the room designs in the house are emphatically inspired by my paintings, as I really wanted to bring their joy into our home. One of the best examples of that is the “goldfish bathroom,” which is bathed in a dappling of water-blue penny tile and features several playful fish paintings. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49061" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15.jpg" alt="penny tile bathroom" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3 class="p3">Natural elements soften</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Correspondingly throughout the house, we also chose simple items to offset the highly visible ones.  We went with pre-painted cabinetry in the kitchen, and the same hardwood floors as in other rooms. The lights are modern loft pendants, clean in matte white.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More and more designers, contractors and homeowners believe that one of the best ways to make a bold design statement is to opt for wallpaper over paint. It provides hundreds of looks and textures that a regular paint job can&#8217;t match. And while more expensive than traditional paint,  wallpaper is usually less expensive than hiring a painter to create a decorative surface. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, </span><span class="s2">shows why this covering is gaining in popularity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improved techniques</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although wallpaper has been around for years, there are a few reasons for its resurgence in popularity.  For one, people who grew up with it in their homes may have soured on it, but thanks to new printing and manufacturing techniques, manufacturers are producing dozens of new colors, designs, and textures, sparking a renewed appreciation for the product.  &#8220;Wallpaper has become much more interesting, &#8221; said Sweeten designer<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tina. &#8220;It&#8217;s not your grandmother&#8217;s wallpaper anymore. Even if you are going for a minimalist look, a textured wallpaper adds so much more than flat paint to a room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners are increasingly asking for wallpaper in their homes. Tina tells how one of her clients already had wallpaper picked out for one of the rooms before they even met to discuss the project. &#8220;People are much more receptive than they used to be,&#8221; said Tina &#8221; One reason may be that they see so many design ideas on the internet where in the past you could only see ideas in magazines. There was no option to see the world quickly.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Jessica + Alex&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">textured wallcovering</a>; Brooke + Sam added <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor-to-ceiling patterns</a> to both bathrooms</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the types of designs that are getting noticed include 3D papers where the design seems to pop off of the wall, gradient papers where the colors and designs transition from floor to ceiling, metal looks, and geometric shapes. Custom printed options are also available. There are services that allow you to upload a photo or some other design you&#8217;ve created and have it turned into wallpaper.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where to use wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most designers use it in the main living areas: living room, dining room, and bedrooms. Some use it on an accent wall to make a bold statement. Others cover all of the walls, some even use it on ceilings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The use of wallpaper in bathrooms is a matter of contention among designers and contractors. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to use it in full bathrooms because of the moisture problems,&#8221; said Sweeten contractor Ilya. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen people put it in the shower area. I personally would not do that.&#8221; It should be noted that some wallpapers are designed for use in high-moisture areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ilya has used wallpaper in powder rooms. In a recent remodel in Red Hook, the client &#8220;chose a bold print wallpaper that brings the whole space to life,&#8221; he said. The wallpaper has a white background with a large green floral print. The powder room has matte back accessories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Designer Tina does not use it in bathrooms because she prefers to utilize tile that runs up to the ceiling. &#8220;But I do like it in powder rooms to create a jewel-box effect,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Working with wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another reason for the increased popularity is that today&#8217;s products are easier to work with than older versions. &#8220;It&#8217;s still an art form to hang wallpaper correctly,&#8221; said Ilya. &#8220;But it is easier than it used to be and it is also easier to match patterns.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the product, wallpaper comes prepasted, and soaking the sheets in water activates the adhesive. Another method is to apply adhesive to the paper or directly to the wall. Spreading adhesive on the wall tends to be less messy than brushing it on the back of the paper and then transferring the sheet to the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many papers are listed as strippable or peelable, meaning it is easy to get them off of the walls when it is time for a change. Ilya says that when you do remove the wallpaper, it is necessary to skim coat the walls before painting. If new wallpaper is called for, you should remove all of the old adhesive and prime the wall. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Types of wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wallpaper is made from a number of materials, but some form of vinyl is the most common. The material is durable, easy to keep clean, and many vinyl papers are easy to remove. There are a number of products that contain vinyl in some way.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Solid vinyl &#8211; This thick paper consists of a solid layer of vinyl laminated to a paper or fabric substrate. This is the most durable of vinyl-containing products.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vinyl coated fabric &#8211; Liquid vinyl coats a fabric base, making the paper breathable.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vinyl coated paper &#8211; A liquid coating is applied to a paper base. These papers are easy to clean and remove, but not as durable as a solid vinyl paper.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Non-woven paper &#8211; This is a combination of natural and synthetic materials similar to those used in making tea bags and coffee filters. It is durable, washable, tear-resistant, and breathable.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Grasscloth &#8211; Natural materials like hemp or seagrass are woven with cotton and attached to a natural backing. These papers offer striking designs, but they are difficult to hang and keep clean. Best for low traffic areas.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Flock wallpaper &#8211; In this product, a material, such as wool or rayon, is applied to an adhesive backing, creating a raised design. The distinctive designs are difficult to clean and best left to low-traffic areas like bedrooms and formal living rooms.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Metallic wallpaper &#8211; These foil products contain aluminum or some other metal added to the surface of the paper. Available in solid metallic colors, such as gold, brass, and copper or in geometric and other designs. Some of these metallic papers require a specialized application.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wallpaper, even a small installation, can go a long way. With its various patterns, colors, and tactile designs, consider it as a decorative accessory that lends a pop of texture. </span></p>

			<h2>Refined or graphic, wallcoverings can change the feel of a space in an instant</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wallpaper-in-bathrooms-cover.jpg" alt="Bathroom sink with leafy wallpaper" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56825" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wallpaper-in-bathrooms-cover.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wallpaper-in-bathrooms-cover-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wallpaper-in-bathrooms-cover-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Wallpaper in bathrooms is the ideal place to try out a bold print. The smaller square footage would be less overwhelming than a larger one. Choose a graphic pattern to add drama to a neutral space. Alternatively, a subtle design can add just the right amount of interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understandably, the moisture issue is often what causes renovators to hesitate. Whether a powder room or a full bath, wallpaper in bathrooms is now often made to withstand water conditions, thanks to improved adhesives. Plus, there are vinyl, waterproof wallpaper options. Even many non-vinyl wallpapers are washable (in case of soap or toothpaste stains), water-resistant, and scrubbable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most bathrooms have some kind of ventilation—either an exhaust connected to your heating/cooling system or a window. As long as there isn’t lingering humidity in the room, you shouldn’t have a problem. Here, Sweeten showcases 12 renovations with expressive walls.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>

<p class="p1">(1st slide) Artist Katy Garry channeled interior designer Dorothy Draper, known for her use of exuberant color and pattern, for her <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-floor bathroom</a>. She loved the surprise of opening the door to Dorothy Draper&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dorothydraperhome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazilliance Grove Stripe Green wallpaper</a> and a chartreuse-painted ceiling. Katy joked to her husband “that splurgy wallpaper was more important than running water.”</p>
<p>(2nd slide) With no need for a bathtub on the parlor floor of this Tudor townhouse, interior designer <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meredith</a> converted a full bath into a half bath. (The remaining space was used for a pantry). The new powder room was perfectly charming: a Brooklyn Toile on the walls designed by <a href="https://www.flavorpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beastie Boys&#8217; Mike D for Flavor Paper</a> offset geometric floor tiles in the same color scheme.</p>
<p>(3rd slide) Living in their home during the renovation, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia and Ed</a> realized their master bathroom needed a facelift. To stay within their budget, the couple kept the bathtub, flooring, and toilet and instead focused on key cosmetic details. Case in point? Their herringbone wallpaper by <a href="https://fermliving.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferm Living</a> fit right in with the clean, calm vibe.</p>

<p class="p1">(1st slide) Inspired by Instagram, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/sage-green-kitchen-remodel-in-kips-bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison</a> tried out a bold wallpaper to balance the neutral tile in her family’s bathroom. It was also windowless so the pop of color was welcomed. She wasn’t sure how she felt about the pattern so she purchased it as a peel-and-stick. It turns out it started to peel every time the shower was turned on. At that point, she loved the <a href="https://www.yorkwallcoverings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wallpaper pattern</a> designed by Rifle Paper Co. and had the traditional paste version installed. Allison reported no issues with moisture!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>(2nd slide) “Powder rooms should be wacky,” insisted Sweeten renovator <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nazli</a>. She practiced what she preached by choosing a bright red-orange door that opens to a tiny but lushly <a href="https://cole-and-son.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cole &amp; Sons wallpapered</a> half bath that is located next to their dining room. Add brass fixtures and a Moroccan-inspired tile pattern to the floor, and the result is one-of-a-kind!</p>
<p>(3rd slide) It took two years for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooke and Sam</a> to find the right home for their family. And when they did, they had fun using wallpaper to give her daughter’s bathroom personality. Thinking ahead, sophisticated gray and white tiles were the permanent elements that a future buyer would appreciate. However, the blue, pink, and yellow <a href="https://chasingpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floral wallpaper from Chasing Paper</a> was the decorative item that brought the space to life.</p>
<p>(4th slide) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex and Tom</a> were initially planning to just tackle a kitchen reno, but ultimately decided the bathroom deserved a redo, too. They brought in details to align with the earthy scheme throughout the home with a large-scale leaf wallpaper from <a href="https://calicowallpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calico</a>, a walnut vanity, and vertically-laid black tiles.</p>

<h3>Wallpaper in bathrooms with whimsical designs</h3>

<div></div>
<p>(1st slide) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bellamy and Zack’s</a> first-floor bath featured a <a href="https://www.target.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peel-and-stick wallcovering</a> called Speckle Dot. Luckily, the space was an easy update, thanks to its already functional layout. After a rip-and-replace of the fixtures, the couple tested out their DIY skills and added this jaunty black-and-white paper.</p>
<p>(2nd slide) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett and Terri</a> stuck with a monochrome white-and-gray palette to make their bathroom feel bigger and brighter. To break up the floor-to-ceiling subway tile, Terri found a subtle aquatic-themed wallpaper from <a href="https://www.hyggeandwest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hygge and West</a>, Underwater World, that adds a whimsical touch to the guest bath.</p>
<p>(3rd slide) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David</a> didn’t want to sell the home they had lived in for 12 years. Their 1924 house would be renovated to live in for the long-term and gut renovated down to the framing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The couple opened up the interiors and modernized the exterior architecture. Design-wise,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>they sought a Scandinavian-modern look with Mid-Century and industrial touches. It extended into a powder room that was a small space. It received a compact sink and vanity. The size was just right for this <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drop It wallpaper</a> with a pattern—graphic yet pacifying. “I wanted <span class="s1">all eyes to be on the geometric wallpaper</span>,&#8221; said Kirsty.</p>
<h3>Bonus: Two bathrooms with feature walls</h3>
<p>Two bonus bathrooms that feature wallpaper designs that complement other features of the renovation, in this case, tile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/108432-Jan-Eliason-Apt-20.jpg" alt="Bathroom with floral lemon print light blue yellow wallpaper" width="1600" height="2399" class="alignnone wp-image-58186 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/108432-Jan-Eliason-Apt-20.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/108432-Jan-Eliason-Apt-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/108432-Jan-Eliason-Apt-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>This <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/">powder room</a> features tile that compliments the wallpaper perfectly. This homeowner <span>kept scrolling through Pinterest until they found a pattern and color that they couldn&#8217;t live without. </span></p>
