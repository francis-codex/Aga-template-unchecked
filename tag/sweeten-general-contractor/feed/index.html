<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Detailed scopes of work</h3>
<p>&#8220;I was very fortunate to have <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/aleks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aleks and his team</a> work on my apartment&#8217;s renovation. From the start when I met him for the first time, Aleks was friendly, very meticulous, and attentive to details. He proposed options and recommendations for my requirements without being aggressive. Aleks provided me with a very detailed scope of work. Because of this, it only took the property management company of my co-op building 2 weeks to approve the work. They did a full renovation of bathroom and kitchen, refinishing the floors, painting, replacing the closet shelvings and bars, and refinishing the closet doors.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Handling difficult building management</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eli and his team</a> on a kitchen renovation in our co-op. For anyone that has worked or owned a co-op before, you know there can be a lot of back and forth with approvals with the co-op board and management company. Eli was a great partner in getting all of the necessary documentation to the management company, and communicating directly with them when needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Working with the budget</h3>
<p>&#8220;We had a wonderful time working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4137#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a>. As first-time homeowners, we had heard horror stories from friends about unresponsive contractors they had encountered while renovating. Certainly not our experience at all with James. They worked around our budget and helped us understand which items were worth splurging on and where we could cut back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Kris was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16043212],&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris</a> was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much. We had heard so many horror stories from our friends that made us nervous at first—but Kris and his team though were very professional and completed the work on time and on budget. We&#8217;re thrilled with the work they did!&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Leading first-time renovators to success</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/santiago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Santiago</a> was very pleasant and easy to work with. As first-time renovators, we appreciated his patience in answering our 1,000,000 questions. He was very flexible in helping us define a scope for the project that matched our budget and helped us strategize to make our money go the furthest. During the work phase, his team was mindful of the fact that we still lived in the space (with a toddler!) and did their best to minimize disruption to our lives. They also finished on time and on budget!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Consistent, clear communication</h3>
<p>&#8220;Working with <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pellumb (Paul)</a> was hands-down the best renovation decision I made. He has incredible communication skills and kept me informed from start to finish. As an interior designer in the industry for over 12 years, I was pleasantly surprised to meet a contractor with such pride and commitment to his work. His crew was timely and respectful when working in my home. I was lucky enough to go on vacation for 2 weeks towards the end of the project, and when 2 surprise leaks were discovered, the problem was resolved without hesitation. Paul was only a WhatApp message away with pictures and updates of the problem being solved.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Friendly subcontractor teams</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During the construction, we got to know all the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor&#8217;s workers</a> and really enjoyed having them around. (And even know all their personalities and preferred playlists!) They are respectful and diligent. Most importantly, they&#8217;re very experienced and are able to give good suggestions and to make decisions. We lived on-site for the second half of the project. It was definitely messy and frustrating at times, but the crew made it easier for us. We truly appreciated that.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Helping hands for materials &amp; design</h3>
<p class="p1">“From the beginning, <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/paulina-albert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paulina</a> &#8216;got&#8217; what we were looking for: a modern, minimalist aesthetic that is functional for a family. Her creative design of the space, kitchen, closets, and built-ins helped to maximize our space and make our apartment feel much more spacious than the actual square footage would suggest. Our 9-year-old daughter gave her a nearly impossible task to find &#8216;teal and rainbow&#8217; tiles for her bathroom and she found a beautiful iridescent tile that has drawn the admiration of all who have seen it.”</p>
<h3>Keeping a clean worksite</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During the work, I was able to stay in my apartment because <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/meet-sweeten-general-contractors-nina-ilya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ilya and Nina</a> took great precautions to cover everything with plastic so that it wouldn’t be covered with dust. At the end of each workday, the team also cleaned up the workspace, to the extent possible, and stored everything in one, compact space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul</a> and team have been amazing the whole way, and while we did more than half of the work before we moved in, we moved in while the top floor was still being renovated and lived in the space for about 8 weeks during construction. The team was great in keeping the site clean, but we really noticed that they kept the dust and construction contained once we had moved in too!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Problem-solving pros</h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Chris is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver. He was always quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls regardless of time of day. My project was a gut renovation in an apartment that hadn't been occupied for over 6 years. Despite some challenges, including a bathroom so small that a standard sized tub couldn't fit in, a leak discovered by Chris's plumber, and a switch from a gas stove to electric, Chris was able to deliver the project on time and close to the initial proposal. The few change orders were my chosen enhancements to the project - including a custom closet and moving the bathroom pipes closer to the edges of the wall to gain a few inches for the bathroom. Highly recommend Chris. Gut renovations in a New York City apartment co-op are incredibly stressful and Chris was a reliable contractor I trusted to get the job done and appease the board.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16773836},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">&#8220;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5698#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver. He was always quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls regardless of the time of day. My project was a gut renovation in an apartment that hadn&#8217;t been occupied for over 6 years.

<h3>Tackling big projects with ease</h3>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil</a> is great to work with. Our project was massive! New roof, gutters, windows, and siding, to our 95-year-old free-standing house. Plus, we completely gutted and redesigned the basement with upgrades in plumbing and electrical, as well as finding and fixing a leak issue that caused the basement to flood during heavy rains. Doing such a variety of work required tremendous organization, workweeks planned weeks in advance and staying flexible when the unexpected arose. Neil handled each step with patience and humor, and so when each project was finished, we felt happy, confident, and satisfied that the craftsmanship was what we desired and all problems were resolved.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Meeting your contractor over video can help you renovate safely during COVID-19. </span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-45033 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VideoVisti-CHOSEN.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VideoVisti-CHOSEN.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VideoVisti-CHOSEN-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">With COVID-19 quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, it can be difficult to move ahead with home improvement and building projects. Social distancing practices are vital to everyone’s health and safety. Many states and cities have halted all construction they consider non-essential. Luckily, there is an important virtual solution to help homeowners renovate safely during COVID-19. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">At Sweeten, we’ve worked with our community of contractors to create the following guidelines for conducting virtual site visits. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> </span><span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.. </span><span class="s2">We’re in the business of taking the complication and uncertainty out of the renovation process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is a virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Homeowners preparing for a renovation or new construction must meet with a general contractor for a thorough review of the property. Traditionally, the general contractor looks at the property in-person to understand the existing site conditions, take measurements, review documents, and discuss the project with the homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">A virtual site visit is the same process, conducted by video call. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit gives the contractor the same visual information as an in-person visit. It also has similar limitations; don’t expect to resolve everything in one visit. Lingering questions can always be resolved during a later visit, over video, or in-person. </span>Do note that contractors&#8217; estimates will be considered “commercially reasonable” but not ironclad. A physical site visit will need to be done at some point to make their own measurements and account for every detail.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">A streaming video conference replaces both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If done effectively, a virtual site visit usually gives the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s1">I truly believe a virtual site meeting for most projects will be enough to send an estimate for the labor cost,” says Long Island-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6806#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Robi</a>. “The one item that is held up is the material selection process.” However, if you’ve hired a design-build firm that is assisting you with design and materials, “then even the design process can be done virtually in order to get the price of material selections.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">One important limitation: an estimate based on the virtual site visit will be considered “best-effort” or “commercially reasonable.” It may require adjustments after the contractor makes their own measurements. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do I prepare for a virtual site visit? </span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Think of it more as a formal interview than as a chat with friends or family. It’s important to be well prepared. Make sure you’ve organized your brief and any supplementary papers, your measurements, and your questions and talking points (see “</span><span class="s1">Post your project + p</span><span class="s1">repare background information</span><span class="s1">,” below). </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 1: Prepare your video technology</span></h4>
<h5 class="p6"><strong><span class="s1">The Sweeten Video tool:</span></strong></h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">Sweeten&#8217;s in-platform video tool for virtual site visits makes it easy and organized to work with a potential general contractor. It will run on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. No outside video apps or other downloads will be necessary. Save time on working out Android/iPhone compatibility issues. </span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">All parties will receive a link to the video meeting in an email.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you can, try testing it with a friend or family member. Make sure your signal is strong enough to let you chat while walking through the worksite. This will all cut down on time spent fiddling with technology during the virtual visit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your video camera cannot be anchored to a desktop computer or laptop. Phones and tablets are the best tools for walk-throughs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s6">Agree on a backup plan, in case your video quality breaks down during the call. Will you move to a regular phone call? Or, if you think you can resolve the connection problems, will you reschedule a video call?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you choose to use a third-party app, you and the general contractor must use the same video chat app. If one or both parties use an Android, you won’t be able to use Facetime. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 2: Post your project + p</span><span class="s1">repare background information</span></h4>
<p>The Sweeten contractors you meet with will need <span class="s1">background information and a thorough project description to supplement the visuals. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post your project</a> on Sweeten where the contractors can review this information before the video call. </span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to include in your project post:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">A clear description of all work you would like done<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Length, depth, and height measurements of each room being worked on<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">A simple floor plan. This is optional and can be obtained from a property closing or an online realtor site like StreetEasy.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Age of the property<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Prior renovation work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Homeowners association covenants applicable to the project<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Entry access such as stairs or elevator<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Parking availability<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Take photos: </span><span class="s1">Prepare three or four well-lit still photos of the project area that convey a sense of scale. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 2a: One-page briefs</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you are not in our service area, the local contractors you meet will still need this information. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Create a one-page brief that includes the bullet points above, including the still photos. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To prevent information overload, keep the brief truly brief—ideally, keep it to one page. E-mail the brief and the photos to the general contractor at least a few days before your virtual site visit. Keep your copies with you during the visit, for reference.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 3: Prepare your talking points</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Site visits typically begin with a walkthrough, followed by a sit-down discussion of the project. These typically last between 60—90 minutes on average. Prepare a list of topics that you would like to discuss. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Important points to cover:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s5">Whether particular spaces </span><span class="s1">will or will not be available for a certain amount of time</span><span class="s5"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">What materials and fixtures will be recycled and reused<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">How the non-remodel parts of the house will be protected during the renovation<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p6"><span class="s1">Step 4: Prepare your house</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As with an in-person site visit, you need to prepare the area before the virtual walkthrough.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Remove any clutter and any furniture that could block important views<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Maximize the light by uncovering all windows and turning on the lights<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Prepare to close off the area from wandering pets or children<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Tip: you can make your virtual walkthrough more productive by conducting a practice run with a friend. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What can I expect during my virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit usually has three phases: introduction, walkthrough, and a sit-down conference.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Introductions</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This is your opportunity for a casual hello, and a stand-in for a handshake. You get to see each other’s faces. You may also want to discuss what time you’ll end the call.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Virtual renovation site walkthrough</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let your contractor play an active role. As you move through the space, make sure you’re showing them what they need to see. They may ask you to double back or move in closer to something, and may ask you to pause at certain points so they can take screenshots. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Unless the general contractor requests otherwise, walk through the space in this order, always moving the camera slowly:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Establish the general environment directly beyond the intended work area. If this is a bathroom remodel, for example, show the rooms and the hallways just outside the bathroom.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Move into the work area through its main entrance.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">In the work area itself, stand at the center and turn the camera slowly, 360-degrees.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Standing at various points along the perimeter, pan the camera slowly across the space.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Move the camera from the ceiling to the floor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Highlight key sections. In the bathroom remodel example, the shower or bathtub would be a section to highlight. Direct the contractor’s attention with a “show-and-tell” technique; hold the phone in one hand and point with the other. Make sure you can see your pointing hand on your own screen, and that it’s clear what you’re pointing to. <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44885 mt-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha.jpg" alt="virtual renovation site visit in bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Show a few close-ups. For example, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/remodeling-a-bathroom-six-trends-to-consider-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a bathroom renovation</a>, show a close-up view of the shower walls, open up the vanity doors to show the valves under the sink, and show where the toilet valve is located.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">As long as you can maintain a video signal, move to the outermost part of your property such as the exterior door, sidewalk, driveway, and street to give the contractor a sense of access. The contractor doesn’t need to see your face as you’re walking through the home. They just need to see the space.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Sit-down conference</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Move to a table or desk. Turn the camera back around to your face. Discuss the walkthrough, the contractor’s questions, and the talking points that you prepared earlier.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What comes after my virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">E-mail your contractor. After the formalities of thanking the contractor for the visit, document in writing your common understandings of the project, particularly anything not covered in the brief.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">First, clarify the project’s status. Do you want the project to move ahead, which means asking the contractor to submit an estimate? If so, state this clearly. Confirm with the contractor whether they are able to submit an estimate for your review.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your contractor may come up with more questions while preparing the estimate, known in the industry as “Requests For Information.” Your email establishes a clear channel for these requests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">Be aware that your contractor’s estimate will be considered “commercially reasonable” but not ironclad. Contractors will not be able to account for every detail before they’ve done a physical site visit and made their own measurements.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When you’ve received estimates from all the contractors you’ve approached, it will be time to make your choice. Sweeten can help by “<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/"><span class="s7">bid leveling</span></a>,” which means translating all the estimates into equivalent terms so they can be directly compared.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit is a powerful tool for renovating safely during COVID-19. It will let you take important steps on your renovation, including booking a contractor, all while sheltering-in-place. When restrictions lift and the economy recovers, your preferred contractors will be much harder to book. We hope these guidelines will help you get a head start, and help you complete your renovation as quickly and safely as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">—</span></p>
<p class="p2">Turn your home into a space you love. Post your project and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten will guide you</a> all the way through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Grow your contracting business by following these easy steps on Facebook and Instagram</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44674" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having social media business pages enables business owners like yourself to easily grow your contracting business. These accounts will help you to establish a custom online presence in communities where your past and potential clients already spend their time. Whether you have already created pages or you are looking to start from scratch, business pages allow your audience to easily find your company, increasing the credibility of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a service that connects qualified <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/signup/expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractors, builders, and remodelers</a> with homeowners and design professionals with renovation projects, offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this guide to help you establish an online presence. When speaking with clients, frequently referenced sites include Facebook and Instagram. Pulling together cohesive messaging and showcasing past projects on these platforms can help give your firm a leg up. Ready to grow your business’s presence on social media? </span></p>
<h3><strong>Facebook Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your profile</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before creating a Facebook business page, you must establish an individual profile on Facebook if you do not have one already. You can use an existing individual profile to create a page for your contracting business or start a new individual profile specifically for the purposes of setting up your company page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that there is some overlap in login information between company pages and individual profiles, so if you want team members to have access, it may make sense to start an individual account that is solely for business purposes. </span></p>
<p><strong>Create your business page (or clean it up!)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve established an individual profile, “Create a Page” for your business. Upload a Profile Picture and Cover Photo &#8212; pages with cover photos typically get more page likes and visits! Choose photos that showcase your work and that you’d be proud to have potential clients see. This is where you want to show your best work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a profile, take some time to remove any content or posts that don’t support or strengthen your business profile. A good gut check is to ask yourself, would I show this photo to potential clients? If the answer is no, take it off your business page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Describe your services</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Description: Write a brief description that will appear in the search results. This is where you can let people know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they should engage with your business and what neighborhoods you operate in. What are your specialties and in-house capabilities? How will you help clients achieve their goals? Evaluate this description once a year and consider using it across your online profiles including in your Sweeten company description! </span></p>
<p><strong>Use quality pictures that showcase past work</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should choose 3 or 4 projects (like you did to join Sweeten!) that showcase your strengths and the beautiful work that your company does to get your business page started. In general, post valuable content that will resonate with your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an awesome project underway? Post photos of in-progress projects or completed projects so your audience can get a taste of your work experience. Pick a few photos and write up a few sentences to describe the scope of work that you accomplished for each project. Again use that gut check, if you wouldn’t show the photo to potential clients &#8212; don’t upload it to your page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Promote your page</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You now have a Facebook business page that will give potential clients a feel for your firm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When people like your page, it&#8217;s easier for others to discover it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use your other channels like your website or Sweeten profile to promote your page. You can even connect it with your firm’s Instagram account so you can update both simultaneously. Linking the page can be one way of minimizing upkeep, but remember to check in on the account at least every 6 months to make updates and add new photos of recent work.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Instagram</strong><strong> Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your account </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the Instagram app as there are many features not available on the desktop version of their site. Pick a username or “handle” that represents your business. Try to use some combination of your company name or initials and keywords for the industry (think “home,” “remodeling,” “GC,” “contractor,” etc.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you just signed up or already have a handle, switch the account to “professional” and review the privacy settings to set your account as public so potential clients can easily find your account. </span></p>
<p><strong>Define your business and a company bio</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add your company name so clients can identify or search for your firm. Write a brief company bio and try to stick to the 150 character limit. Include where you are based, and highlight your firm’s strengths, goals or accolades. </span></p>
<p><strong>Fill up the grid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick at least nine photos that you are the proudest of to get your profile off the ground. Once you’ve filled up the initial grid, you’ll have a great base to build off of. If you already have an account, consider deleting any posts that don’t support the services you are trying to convey.</span></p>
<p><strong>Provide captions for your photos</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write a short caption for each posted photo to let clients know why that photo is significant. Don’t be afraid to use hashtags in the caption or tag other accounts in the photo. Engaging with other accounts through hashtags, tags, and comments can help others find and follow your account. You can also add geotags so potential clients can see the general location of any projects that you post. These features can be edited or updated at any time, so they’re ideal you’re looking to refresh old posts with photos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Follow others in your industry</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@sweeten_home on Instagram</a> and then follow any industry contacts that you might have, including designers, architects, subcontractors, or showrooms. Not only will this help you stay current on industry news or events, but it will also inform your explore page, which Instagram generates to help you find new accounts. </span></p>
<p>Follow these steps to enhance your social media business profiles and you&#8217;ll make great progress to grow your contracting business online.</p>
