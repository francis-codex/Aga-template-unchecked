										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Adding color to a bathroom<span>—in small accents or large splashes—</span>can have a big design impact</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47686 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bathroom-Pop-Color.jpg" alt="color ideas for bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bathroom-Pop-Color.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bathroom-Pop-Color-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Adding colorful accents to your bathroom when you renovate is a good way to show your own style and personality. These colorful accents can be in the form of vanities, wall paint, and tile.  By selecting your favorite hue and incorporating it into your next bathroom remodel, you can effectively create any mood/vibe you like.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how some Sweeten renovators incorporated colorways outside of neutral making a trip to the bathroom a happy event.</p>

<h3>Bold in blue bathrooms</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40139" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Blue comes in all shades, making it a good color choice to accommodate many design styles. Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-bedroom-conversion-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine and Chris</a> needed more space for their growing family. They found a promising two-bedroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that they could transform with the help of a Sweeten contractor. Their contractor overhauled the bathroom and the couple decided to add a splash of color with a dramatic blue vanity and storage closet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43251" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06.jpg" alt="shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their 1,800-square-foot full apartment renovation, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/full-apartment-renovation-smooths-out-traffic-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dara and Mauricio</a> posted their project scope to Sweeten and found a contractor to update their bathroom. &#8220;In terms of style, we tried to reach a middle ground between our preferences,&#8221; says Mauricio. &#8220;I chose a more eclectic style for the second bathroom: gray-and-blue patterned tiles on the floor and shower wall mixed with large white subway tiles.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="powder-blue-vanity-white-farmhouse-sink" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44229" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="powder blue vanity with white farmhouse sink and large frameless vanity mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-historic-brownstone-bath-remodel-stays-true-to-its-roots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy and her husband</a> also found themselves in a similar situation in that they couldn&#8217;t put off a renovation any longer. Except for this couple, there wasn&#8217;t a new baby on the way: the bathroom was leaky and in bad need of repair. They wanted to stay true to the feel of their circa late-1800s brownstone, so Peggy selected classic design elements, including a blue vanity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-door-with-knob-to-white-bathroom" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49090" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="White door with knob opening to white bathroom with blue penny tiles with white vanity and white tub after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When Kate and Daniel redid their bathroom, they went spent a lot of time researching different styles online and on social media. They went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic subway tile</a> for the walls and hexagonal tile in a royal blue colorway for the floor.</p>
<h3>Greens with envy</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With so <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/bathrooms/g756/colorful-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many different shades of green</a> to choose from, it is no wonder so many renovators are finding it easy to pick the one that suits their style. Brooklyn residents <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/green-bath-renovation-ditmas-park-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gus and Katherine</a> (<em>above</em>) used a clever mix of tiles for their bathroom remodel, which includes a herringbone ceramic in Jadite for a statement wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="green-hex-tiles-sunburst-pattern" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48509" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09.jpg" alt="Green hex tiles with sunburst pattern double floating vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Fellow Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi and David</a> also selected an unconventional tile for their bathroom renovation. They replaced a subdued floor with a cement Dandelion tile in Lawn/Milk. These hex tiles with watercolor edges and abstract white lines depict sunburst.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="sea-green-shower-wall-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40914" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with recessed shelf and sea green tiles on wall and brushed gold shower head and fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="1475" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07-203x300.jpg 203w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07-600x885.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07-585x863.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/eclectic-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allyson,</a> an attorney who purchased a 1920s home in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, also used green to make a design statement in her bath. “I really wanted my bathroom to reflect my love of travel and combine vintage and mid-century modern elements,&#8221; says Allyson. Her Sweeten contractor installed shower tiles in a rich aqua green that features a windblown texture—the idea behind them was to make you feel like you&#8217;re surrounded by water.</p>
<h3>Orange is the new black</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35491" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg" alt="wallpaper, bathroom, home, design, renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">These Brooklyn homeowners</a> turned to a Sweeten contractor to remodel their apartment that hadn&#8217;t been updated since the 1980s. A black color scheme was chosen with a pop of color in the flooring tile. They installed black tile on the wall by the sink, and offset it with a geometric tile on the floor in burnt orange.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48285" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09.jpg" alt="women general contractors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Liz and Kevin</a>, residents of Los Angeles, were thrilled with finding a home in SoCal. The catch? The 1923 house had water damage that required the bathroom to be gutted. With the help of a Sweeten contractor, they were able to transform the space into a modern oasis. They took a chance and added a striking backsplash to the sink area. “The orange,” Liz said, “felt like a risk, but a little playful, like us.”</span></p>
<h3>Back in black</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44041" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Today, a lot of home design blogs are touting &#8220;blue is the new black&#8221; or &#8220;yellow is the new black.&#8221; But rest assured black is back—and here to stay. Look no further than Sweeten renovator <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veronica&#8217;s bathroom remodel</a>. She worked with a Sweeten contractor to update her entire bath after she found a leaky pipe in her Manhattan co-op. She was happy to get rid of the outdated beige tile and old jet tub and replace them with more chic options. By painting the walls black, it lends a modern aesthetic to the room. “The bathroom got very little light to begin with, so I decided to embrace the cave-like atmosphere and go dark,” Veronica says.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27231" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />When <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia and Ed</a> got a new dog, Roxy, they realized they wanted a pet-friendly neighborhood. They found a 1,400-square-foot brownstone in Brooklyn but it needed to be renovated. The bathroom had broken tiles and much of the space was outdated and in need of repair. For the guest bathroom, the couple selected a black-and-white color palette. The result is a classic yet sleek aesthetic.</p>

			<h2>These white subway tile kitchens showcase 5 fresh takes on a classic trend</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40333 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09.jpg" alt="Image of a white subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>Many homeowners choose classic white subway tiles to give their kitchens a polished finish. They&#8217;re a versatile design feature, with styles and textures found in multiple materials like marble, glass, and ceramic. They also have many uses, most frequently as statement pieces in backsplashes, or as a complete wall design. Ultimately, white subway tiles have become popular because they offer a minimalist look that matches all styles and sizes of kitchens.</p>
<p>Here, we&#8217;re sharing 6 Sweeten kitchen renovations that used white subway tiles in inspiring ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Cleverly-disguised kitchen cabinets</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44867 mb-0 size-full" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="white subway tile kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>When <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners Tara and Brian </a>decided it was time to update their home, they knew they wanted a modern atmosphere. They were done with their dated oak cabinets and cluttered room design and were ready for a <a href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/styles/modern/minimalist-kitchen-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more minimalist, open layout</a>. To get there, they added a glossy white subway tile backsplash that extends through an entire wall. The subway tiles also double as doors to their hidden pantry, giving an otherwise incognito cabinet a sleek finish.</p>
<h3>A marble take on white subway tiles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23867 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="marble subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Romuald</a> renovated his Elmhurst home to achieve an open concept cook space. In the kitchen, he opened up the walls to get a direct sightline across the ground floor. Before, his kitchen was dark and closed off. Now, a marble subway tile kitchen backsplash brings a clean look to the room.</p>
<h3>A chevron-patterned subway tile enriches a kitchen</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 10 years of residency, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim and Igor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were ready to upgrade their Carroll Gardens kitchen. Kim &#8220;knew from the get-go&#8221; that she wanted a white kitchen. So, the main focus of their renovation was reducing the dull and uninviting feel while bringing in </span><a href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/two-tone-kitchen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more dual-tone white &amp; gray pieces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They added chevron-patterned subway tiles that had the right textured element to give them the modern and vibrant look they dreamed of. </span></p>
<h3>Glass subway tiles energize a small kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25335 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="glass subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/56-square-feet-small-kitchen-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Jill</a> wanted to renovate her 56-square-foot Yorkville kitchen after 20 years of use. Her goal was to update the design and personalize the small space to better suit her lifestyle. With help from her Sweeten contractor, Jill selected a subway tile for her backsplash in an elegant glass finish. This not only gave her kitchen an upscale, clean look but also visually expanded its small square footage.</p>
<h3>A white-tiled kitchen with a retro-industrial feel</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44329 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03.jpg" alt="white subway tile kitchen " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike </a>were inspired by their building’s historical industrial architecture and decided to renovate their kitchen to achieve that same theme. In order to obtain this, they added classic white subway tiles that line the walls as a way to contrast the darker cabinets. This tiling <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-quick-fix-brightens-a-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brightened up the space </a>and softened the surrounding retro-industrial aesthetic.</p>

Can opening the shower to the rest of the room create a more efficient, luxurious-feeling space? Sweeten explores the possibilities of this intriguing approach.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What is a wet room bathroom? </span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1">A wet room is a bathroom that typically has no enclosure separating the shower or tub from the rest of the bathroom. All of the walls and the flooring are sealed against water, just like the surfaces in a typical shower stall. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The main flooring of the wet room is on the same level as the shower floor. The section of the wet room where the shower is located has a floor with a sharp slope to aid with water drainage. The rest of the bathroom floor is sloped toward the same drain. But the floor slope is more gradual.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because there is so much water, bathroom facilities such as the toilet and sink are either raised or are water-sealed.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Due to how wet rooms work, the function of the room is prioritized over the style. Subsequently, most wet room design is clean and spare.</span></p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Why are wet rooms so popular?</span></h3><ul><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Frameless showers let in more light. These use sheets of thick, unframed glass to surround the shower in a wet room. They make</span><span class="s1"> the whole room lighter and airier. </span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Since wet rooms are designed with excellent ventilation, they typically see less mold and mildew growth.</span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet rooms are much easier to clean. There are no cramped enclosures to deal with, and the whole floor can be hosed down.</span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet room bathrooms are ready for all phases of a person’s life. There are no steps or curbs keeping walkers and wheelchairs out of the shower area. The toilet area merges seamlessly with the shower, too. </span></li></ul><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of wet rooms</span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Pros</b></span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The bathroom feels brighter and more spacious because it has fewer walls and barriers.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The floor is easy to clean—all water can be directed to a single drain.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Accessibility: there is no shower curb or bathtub wall to step over. </span><span class="s1">Wet room designs comply with many <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aging-in-place design rules.</a><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">There&#8217;s less chance of mold, mildew, and water decay.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The bathing area does not steam up because it is not enclosed.<br /></span></li></ul><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Cons</b></span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Splashes from the shower can go everywhere.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s best to have plenty of space, to keep the shower separate from dry areas.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">In smaller bathrooms, dry areas need to be made water-resistant.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">It can feel colder in the shower, since there&#8217;s no enclosure to hold in heat.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The need for more tile work may increase costs.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">They can be acoustically loud and bright because of the open design and hard materials.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Most things stored in the bathroom need to be enclosed in water-resistant cabinets.<br /></span></li></ul><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Features and special considerations</span></h3><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Shower enclosures</b>: Many wet room bathrooms are built without any shower enclosures. However, you can opt for an open enclosure with no door. Or you can add a half-wall to minimize splashing.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom storage</b>: Locating storage and linen cabinets outside of the bathroom is one way to deal with moisture. Another is to install water-resistant cabinets in the room.<br /></span></li><li><span class="s1"><b>Large wet rooms</b>: If you have a big enough space, you may be able to store moisture-sensitive items in the bathroom without special cabinets. </span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Radiant heating</b>: You can install <a href="https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/7-myths-about-radiant-heat-debunked-49301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiant floor heating</a> even though the floor will see plenty of water. Special underfloor radiant heating kits are available.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Raised sink cabinet</b>: Pedestal sinks or cantilevered countertops are ideal choices for keeping cabinetry off the floor.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Relocated heating register</b>: Heating vents cannot be built into the floor. Either build the vents into walls or use another type of heating.<br /></span></li></ul><p>When you&#8217;re ready to begin your bathroom or home remodel, discuss with your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor if a wet room</a> is possible in your space.</p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Wet room bathroom maintenance and cleaning</span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners may worry about installing wet room bathrooms on upper floors. Yet a professionally installed wet room is no different than locating a freestanding shower on an upper floor. The waterproofing methods are the same—just on a larger scale. Be aware that just like with any bathroom, a wet room could eventually spring a leak and require maintenance.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet room floors are easy to clean. You can clean the flooring with a mild floor cleaner and a rubber-bladed mop. Start on the far end of the room and push water toward the shower drain. You can also use a hand-held shower head as a hose.  </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Walls in regular bathrooms can be difficult to clean, especially when they&#8217;re made of drywall or plaster. Wet room walls are hardscaped and water-sealed. So, you can clean them with soap and water without fear of damage.</span></p><p class="p1"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally. If you’re in the NY/NJ metro area, in-stock items typically deliver within 2-3 days.</p><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"></div><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"></div></div></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider <em>all</em> of the materials (not just the tile itself!) plus labor to get a true picture of what it&#8217;ll cost to tile a bathroom</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49028" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg" alt="tiling costs" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When budgeting for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/measure-for-bathroom-tile-accurately-what-youll-need-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom tiling project</a>, it&#8217;s easy to become focused on the cost of the tile itself. After all, tile is at the heart of the project; it’s the main look of all of this. However, crucial (and often overlooked) steps like prep and time for labor can impact how much it&#8217;ll cost you to tile a bathroom. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this guide, Sweeten outlines three categories that go into the cost to tile a bathroom: <strong>prep</strong>, <strong>materials</strong>, and <strong>labor</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Tiling prep work</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before beginning the tile project, a number of items in the bathroom must be removed. After they have been removed, the subfloor must be assessed.</span></p>
<h4>Using ceramic tile in your bathroom?</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ceramic tile requires a stable base (substrate) that is rigid and does not bend. The bathroom’s existing subfloor should either be strong enough or it should be strengthened. For natural stone tile, the industry group <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">Ceramic Tile Education Foundation</span></a> (CTEF) recommends that the substrate be twice as rigid as for tiling with ceramics or porcelains. If the substrate is not smooth enough, it may require an additional layer of underlayment.</span></p>
<h4>Removing bathroom items</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Toilet: The toilet must always be removed before tiling a floor. The toilet will either be replaced, or a new toilet may be installed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Baseboards: Wall baseboards and any type of horizontal wall molding that touches the floor must be removed before tiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Door casing: Door casing—the vertical trim that forms a door frame—usually doesn&#8217;t need to be removed. Tile workers can cut the bottom of the casing and fit the tile underneath.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Shower/bathtub and bathroom cabinet: Showers, tubs, sink cabinets, and any permanent pieces do not need to be removed. However, sometimes they are removed during a full bathroom remodel.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Preparing (or repairing) the subfloor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When installing tile in a remodeled bathroom, it is common to find a damaged subfloor. This damage tends to be concentrated around the toilet, sink, and shower/bathtub. If you are removing the shower or bath, you may find even more damage under the shower pan or bathtub.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sometimes, large sections of the subfloor may need to be removed and replaced with a new subfloor. In some cases, the damage may extend to the floor joists (the beams below the subfloor). Both of these fixes are separate from the tiling.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are working with a general contractor, the contractor will remove all of the necessary items and make repairs. This prep work should be done ahead of time before the tile subcontractor begins.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While removing items is heavily a labor cost, some materials may figure in. This depends on the scale of the project. For example, large projects may require the rental of a dumpster. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Raw materials for prepping</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though tile is the most visible feature of bathroom tile, a support system of other materials makes a bathroom tile surface possible. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Subfloor prep materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Solid subfloor: Exterior-grade, tongue-and-groove plywood is a standard subfloor material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Underlayment on top of subfloor: Many tile pros recommend laying down an additional layer of thin cement board on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Leveling compound: Dips in the subfloor can be corrected with a liquid leveling compound. Poured directly onto the subfloor, this compound is self-leveling. It fills gaps up to 1-1/2-inch deep.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Tiling materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Thin-set: Thin-set is the mortar base that is applied under the tile.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout: Grout is the filler that is applied to the joints between the tiles.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout tint: Grout usually comes in a few variations of gray, black, cream, or white. But grout can also be tinted to nearly any color you desire.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout sealant: Grout is porous and must be sealed to prevent moisture infiltration.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Haze remover: A light haze remains from the grouting process. A liquid haze remover is needed to clean this up.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Optional materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Uncoupling material: When installing tile on concrete, many tile professionals recommend that you use a special material to avoid cracking. An uncoupling material disconnects the tile from the concrete slab. This prevents concrete from transmitting cracks to the tile. <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">CTEF recommends</span></a> that all concrete floors with pre-existing cracks be installed with uncoupling material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Radiant heating: To combat cold tile floors, many homeowners opt for radiant heating underneath the tile. This electrically operated mesh is embedded in the thin-set mortar. It is controlled by a wall thermostat.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Time and cost of labor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many types of home projects are DIY-friendly. But tilework is a long-established, highly skilled craft that can be tricky for many DIYers to master. So, hiring pros to expertly lay the tile pays for itself many times over.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If the cost of tiling materials (thin-set, grout, etc.) is not broken out in an estimate, it may be included in the labor cost. If so, it will be noted as such.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One more factor that affects the cost of tile installation labor is the need for the tile contractor to return several times to the job site. After setting the tile, workers must allow at least 24 hours before returning for grouting. After grouting, workers must wait at least another 4 hours before returning to remove the grout haze. </span><span class="s1">All consults and the clean-up are usually included in the installation cost.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Choosing the style and color of your bathroom tile is an exciting remodeling step. But as you now know, there are many other factors that can impact the total cost to tile a bathroom. Knowing those factors will give you a leg up in understanding the bottom-line total cost when discussing the project with your contractor. </span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with the Sweeten homeowner. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Jaksnap Photography. Stylist: TFStyle Homes, LLC.</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Deciding to </span><span class="s1">remodel an uncomfortable small bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We initially looked for a move-in-ready home, but didn&#8217;t find many in our budget in Clarkson where we wanted to live. The bathrooms in our new split-level house were built in 1982. They would need to be remodeled eventually but we’d tackle them as we could afford them. Three ye</span><span class="s2">ars later and with a toddler in our midst, we were ready. The master bathroom would be our first big project.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We had many problems with the original en-suite bathroom. Mainly, it was hideous. I disliked the color scheme on the wall, the warped laminate vanity, and the stick-on floor tiles. Not only was the pattern terrible, but the tiles were coming unglued. The plastic-insert shower was the worst offender. It was small and claustrophobic, and no amount of scrubbing would remove the mold and mildew stains. Even if it was just cleaned, the bathroom still felt dirty. I couldn’t stand showering in there.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The search for a compatible contractor in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I’d already gotten a few estimates, but we were looking to work with a Black-owned contracting firm and hadn’t found one with availability. In addition, not many contractors want to take on a small space bathroom renovation, not to mention on a minuscule budget. Then I stumbled on a Sweeten blog post featuring <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-owned general contractors</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a> on Sweeten and found one that was also a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contracting firm</a>. I felt really good about her, and she was willing to squeeze us into her schedule.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48164 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3.jpg" alt="blue bathroom with vanity and toilet" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Finding solutions on a shoestring budget</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, our biggest question was, “What does a bathroom remodel cost?” We had a limited budget and no idea what was reasonable. Our budget was $5,000, but quickly realized how below the average cost it was. We would have had to cut too many corners. We couldn&#8217;t afford to change the floorplan, so we agreed on the goal of transforming the bathroom into a pleasant, relaxing space. As a result, I decided to save money by designing the bathroom myself and doing it around an existing light fixture.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A crash course in a small bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I started gathering bathroom remodeling ideas on Pinterest and making a vision board. We considered replacing the shower insert to keep costs down, but the contractor said it would just get gross again. I had no idea what went into building and tiling a walk-in shower. First, I found out it costs a lot more to install mosaic subway tile than larger tile. In addition, I learned that a shower floor’s drainage slope requires mosaic tile, and the ones that come in sheets require less labor. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel Atlanta with subway shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48171" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48169 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg" alt="in-shower storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With so many types of tile out there, we were glad to have the options narrowed for us. We chose large-format ceramic tile for the shower walls and hexagonal mosaic tile for the shower floor—in marble—as I wanted just one aspect to be luxurious. Even with the thoughtful choices, the materials and labor were costly. We gave up replastering the walls, removing the stippling from the ceiling, and installing a recessed light in the shower, all to keep costs down. We even kept the existing toilet, since it was fine.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Coaching and seeking economy</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There were moments when I felt like, “We just can’t afford to do this the right way,” but our Sweeten contractor helped us identify projects we could do ourselves (caulking holes and repairing molding). </span><span class="s1">We chose inexpensive bathroom flooring for the room. An inexpensive vanity helped, and I found the mirror at a discount home store for around $30. Consequently, we saved money and used quality materials where they mattered. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor provided great input and direction—including talking me out of some bad tile choices and kindly suggesting bright, simple colors and patterns. She never took over the vision. She was organized and communicative, and we appreciated her helping us stay (almost) within our revised budget, even after plumbing issues popped up.</span></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The final budget—and excellent outcome</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All told, we more than doubled the original budget (thanks to our family for the generous gift!) coming in just at the starting minimum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost for a bathroom remodel</a> in Atlanta. This included labor, materials, random plumbing parts, and a zillion trips to Home Depot for the paint and other stuff I did on my own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The final result feels larger and is the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spa bathroom</a> of my dreams. It’s so serene. My first bathroom with a walk-in shower and a natural stone floor, both of which feel truly luxe. It’s so lovely to step in there now. Everything is well-installed and of good quality. It’s exactly what we hoped for.</span></p>

<h3>Prepping the bathroom&#8217;s surface</h3>
<p>To measure for bathroom tile on floors or the walls, it would seem that everything is clear-cut, with nothing left open for interpretation. However, there are various factors to consider so that you purchase the correct quantity of tile.</p>
<p>In this guide, Sweeten outlines how to measure the space for accuracy. You&#8217;ll also calculate for enough extra to make the installation smoother.</p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p>When measuring bathroom dimensions and matching numbers to a physical product—tile—questions will come up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overage is required, but how much?</li>
<li>Should you tile under large bathroom components (like tubs and vanity cabinets)?</li>
<li>Does tile seam width change the purchase amount?</li>
<li>For wall tile, how far up does the tile go?</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What you will measure:<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"> </span></strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>You will begin with one set of measurements: those that cannot be changed.</li>
<li>Next, you tighten up that set of numbers by taking variables into account.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What you will need to measure for bathroom tile:</strong></h3>
<p>Begin with a tape measure, preferably one with a metal blade 1-inch wide or more for rigidity. Do not use a vinyl measuring tape of the type used for clothing and other fabrics. A laser measuring device is a great add-on but is not necessary.</p>
<p>You will also need a simple way to jot down numbers. Pen and paper work best, but if you are working with an app or program, you can use that. Having an extra hand, too, eases the process and produces more accurate numbers.</p>
<h3>Getting the fixed dimensions</h3>
<p>Certain dimensions in a bathroom are fixed; meaning, they cannot be changed. Begin there.</p>
<p><strong>To measure the bathroom floor tile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Measure the dimensions of the entire bathroom. Measure from one wall to the opposite wall. Then, measure the other walls from side to side. If the room has alcoves or areas in addition to that larger floor space, measure those separately as if they were separate rooms.</li>
<li>Measure the available floor space that will be tiled. Measure only the floor area that will be tiled. Rather than subtracting non-tiled areas (such as bathtubs) from the overall dimensions of the room, measure the floor space on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To measure the bathroom wall tile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full-wall tile runs from the floor to the ceiling. Areas near showers and bathtubs often receive tile from floor to ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a tile wainscot?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tile wainscot is a tile field that runs partially up the bathroom wall. Forty-two inches is a common wainscot height for a bathroom with a 7-foot or 8-foot ceiling. Even better, measure the height of the ceiling, then divide by one-third and use that as your wainscot height.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To measure the shower wall and floor tile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Measure all shower walls from side to side and top to bottom. Do not account for the shower pan or shower curb.</li>
<li>For the shower pan, measure from side to side in both directions to produce the area measurement.</li>
<li>If the curb or threshold will be tiled, assume a height on both sides of at least 2 inches and a width of at least 2 inches. Shower curbs may not rise more than 9 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips to control for variables:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tape measure will sag, so keep it as straight and level as possible. This is the benefit of having an assistant: to keep the tape measure tight. A laser measuring tool is helpful for distances over 8 to 10 feet, as it produces a straight line.</li>
<li>Ignore baseboards, as tile overlaps baseboards. Be sure to measure from wall to wall, not from baseboard to baseboard.</li>
<li>Subtract cutouts down to the square foot. Items less than a square foot, such as the toilet flange or shower drain, should not be subtracted.</li>
<li>If the sink cabinet will stay in place and you are certain that the bathroom layout will never change, do not tile under the cabinet. Subtract the cabinet from the flooring area.</li>
<li>If you think that you will change the bathroom layout in the future, tile underneath the sink cabinet.</li>
<li>Tile usually does not run under the shower or bathtub. Do not figure shower or tub floor space into your measurements.</li>
<li>Interior tile grout widths range from 1/16-inch to 1/4-inch. Unless this is an unusually large bathroom, do not use grout widths as a variable when measuring for bathroom tile.</li>
<li>Site-built showers do not always need tiled shower pans and curbs. You may subtract this quantity of tile if you expect to use a prefabricated shower pan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using your measurements to purchase bathroom tile</h3>
<p>Once you have a solid set of numbers in hand, you&#8217;re ready to buy the materials. You will need to consider a few issues before you make the final purchase.</p>
<h4>Tile overage: How much extra bathroom tile should I buy?</h4>
<p>After you adjust the fixed quantity of tiles with the control variables, you now have the total amount of tile required—almost! The last step is to plan for a standard overage amount of 10% or more.</p>
<p>For example, a 100-square-foot bathroom with 10% overage results in a purchase of 110 square feet of tile.</p>
<p>Products may <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrive damaged or otherwise unusable</a>. Too many unusable products must be returned, but a broken tile or two may not be worth the effort. More importantly, it is nearly impossible to order exactly the amount of tiles that will be laid down. Field tile edges are typically cut to fit the space. While tile installers strive to recycle cut pieces in other areas of the project, some pieces cannot be used. Boxed tile, too, often ends up with extra tiles left in the box.</p>
<h4>Special-shape or unique-size tiles and layout designs</h4>
<p>Most tiles are square or rectangular, and most layouts are grid or brick patterns. What happens if you vary the tile size or layout?</p>
<p>Unique tile shapes and sizes require that you purchase more tile. If these types of tiles cannot produce a straight edge when laid, increase the overage to 20% or more.</p>
<p>Layouts that differ from grid or brick patterns also require more tile. Diagonal, herringbone, or chevron patterns, for example, result in cut pieces in a variety of triangular sizes. Some triangles can be used elsewhere, but most cannot.</p>
<p class="p1">Measuring your bathroom for tile will give you a good idea of the material cost to add to your budget. When you’re ready to get started on your bathroom or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4>Other factors for measuring bathroom tile</h4>
<p>The ease with which you can return the tiles is an important factor to consider. A brick-and-mortar store may accept sealed, full-box returns for full value or for full value minus a stocking fee. Online tile suppliers may require you to pay to ship back unused tile.</p>
<p>Having some extra tile on hand has its benefits. Over time, installed tile may crack and need to be replaced. Or you may wish to use the tile for smaller applications within the bathroom, such as for a sink backsplash.</p>
<h5>Best tile and applications for bathroom flooring</h5>
<p>All bathroom flooring tiles should be specified as such by the manufacturer in the product description or in the technical specifications. Wall-only tile cannot be used for floors, as it is too thin for foot traffic and often too slippery.</p>
<p>Another clue is the COF (or coefficient of friction) slip ratings published by tile manufacturers. For foot traffic, higher numbers are better than lower numbers. Look for a COF rating of 0.50 or more for your floor tile.</p>
<p>Grout seams are necessary between floor tiles. Wide seams impart more friction, thus a safer floor. More seams, too, give the foot friction. This is one reason why <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mosaic tiles</a> are so popular for floor tiles: the increased proportion of grout to tiles.</p>
<h5>Best tile and applications for bathroom walls</h5>
<p>Like floor tile, manufacturers often label bathroom wall tile. However, in most cases, you can use bathroom floor tiles for bathroom walls.</p>
<p>One exception is with showers, bathtubs, and other high-moisture areas. Look for tiles with a water absorption rate of 0.5 percent or lower. Tiles labeled specifically with the name “porcelain,” as certified by the Porcelain Tile Certification Agency (PTCA), are guaranteed to fall under the absorption rate range.</p>
<p>Given the visibility of bathroom wall tile, it is often best practice to keep tile seams narrower, to use more routine layouts, and to use tiles with less complex visuals. Highly ornate types of tiles are acceptable but are best limited to use in borders or for smaller applications, like backsplashes.</p>
<p>Having a shortage of tile will cause delays, while ordering too much tile affects your budget. Use this guide to measure bathroom tile accurately and you&#8217;ll get even closer to the exact tile quantity you need!</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Leah. &#8220;After&#8221; photos by Miao Jiaxin.</i></span></p>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3>Starting a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah, a lawyer in the finance industry, bought her prewar one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. She spent several years living in the apartment before embarking on a kitchen renovation. She also redid the floors. “The decisions I made after really living in the space were just better—how I moved in and out of the kitchen, how the rooms communicated with each other,” she said.</p>
<div></div>
<h5><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="frameless glass enclosure for white bathtub in a white bathroom with white oval sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31831" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h5>
<h3>Reaching out for help</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation projects became exhausting, so she took a break—even though the bathroom was disjointed from the rest of the apartment, with its beige tones and frumpy &#8217;70s aesthetic. It also had a dropped ceiling for seemingly no reason, which cramped the small space. “I backed away because it seemed like too much to take on,” she said, but she finally took the plunge and posted her NYC prewar bathroom remodel on Sweeten to find a general contractor.</p>
<h5><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="glass enclosed tub" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31836" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Raising up a dropped ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah envisioned something that was reflective of her co-op building’s beautiful foyer with its marble and clean look. “I think my design was to let the space speak for itself,” she said. The Sweeten contractors she hired set out to raise the ceiling. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know what we were going to find,&#8221; Leah said. Because they could not find any pipes or any other obvious reason for the dropped ceiling, they were able to raise it again.</p>
<p>She selected classic subway tiles for the walls and a marble top for the vanity. With the floors, the Sweeten contractors made a reassuring discovery—the original tiles were still underneath, and matched the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new creamy hexagon tiles</a> Leah had chosen. It was a confirmation that her design choices were in line with how the bathroom was originally meant to be.</p>

<h3>Adding warmth</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Leah had planned for white and silver tones, she made a last-minute decision to bring in gold fixtures. “I wanted to add warmth,” she said of the 11th-hour choice. Luckily, she found the renovation process to be far less taxing than she had anticipated. She was in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily communication</a> with her Sweeten contractors, who helped solve problems and helped her make those nuts-and-bolts decisions, like how far up the wall the tiles should go. “It was a very collaborative process,” she said.</p>

<h3>Saving for a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah decided early on where she would save money (like tile choices) <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with her remodeling budget</a> and where she would spend more lavishly. Because of the small space, she decided on a custom bathtub, which took six weeks to make in South Carolina. “Every bathtub that was standard was made for bigger spaces,” she said. “I needed something that fit my dimensions.” The shower enclosure and tub combination became a show stopping centerpiece of the bathroom and were well worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="bathroom reno" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31832" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h2 class="p1">Breaking down the cost of bathroom tile and the top go-to designs for the floor</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-49070 size-full" title="beveled subway tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg" alt="bathroom with black subway tile in the shower" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3>Floor tile from modern country and classic to monochrome</h3>
<p class="p1">While it’s most important for bathroom floor tile to be functional, finding the right design style is what gives the room its personality. Fortunately, the cost of bathroom tile presents a wide spectrum of shapes, colors, and finishes. From the penny round to cement tile, increase or lower the design volume to match your vision.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are some top looks from our Sweeten bathroom renovations—along with pricing info—to guide your search. The price points below fit a wide range of budgets—from $2 per square foot for a classic ceramic and $18+ for a more handmade look to $30+ for a marble mosaic.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>

<h3>Herringbone tile</h3>
<div></div>
<p>(<em>1st photo</em>) Kyli and Luke&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black herringbone tile</a>; (<em>2nd photo</em>) Karun&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/concrete-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industrial bathroom</a>; (<em>3rd photo</em>) Greenwich Village <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loft bath</a></p>
<p class="p1">The herringbone floor tile pattern can easily be the featured focal point in the bathroom. Choose a neutral and the design still delivers dimension and texture. Or opt for a bolder hue for more impact. In a variety of sizes and colors, the tile is popular in marble, porcelain, and ceramic between $4.25–$50 per square foot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Kyli and Luke renovated their bathroom in their 1920s house and used materials that would last. They designed the room to be stark and graphic. Black porcelain tile with black grout produced the artisanal effect they wanted. Sweeten homeowner Karun brought a modern industrial look to his bathroom. A marble herringbone floor tile softens the edgy raw feel overall. In a Greenwhich Village loft, marble is a main feature in the kitchen. The homeowner followed suit with marble in the bathroom with a larger-format herringbone.</p>
<h3>Cement tile</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25.jpg" alt="cost of bathroom tile with cement black and white floor tile" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56693" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Top slides</em>) Mitzi and Jenifer&#8217;s blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cement bathroom tile</a>; (<em>bottom photo</em>) Katy&#8217;s patterned <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cement tile</a></p>
<p class="p1">Cement tile, or encaustic, is durable and its texture has more grip underfoot. Therefore, it is a safe and good-looking choice for the bathroom. Made from natural materials, cement tiles are also porous so they need to be sealed properly. Sweeten homeowners Mitzi and Jenifer installed the same federal blue floor tile in their master and guest bathrooms: one in a stacked bond pattern and the other in a herringbone.</p>
<p class="p1">Plenty of linear shapes coordinate nicely in artist Katy Garry’s master bath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Her Sweeten renovation mixed glossy subway tile with graphic cement floor tile in primarily black neutrals. These tiles can cost between $10–$18 per square foot for an 8” x 8” tile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Ceramic tile</h3>

(<em>Top photo</em>) Brooke and Sam&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powder room</a>; (<em>bottom photo</em>) Nicole&#8217;s patterned <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-sibling-duo-renovates-an-arlington-basement-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ceramic bath tile</a></p>
<p><span class="s1"></span>Ceramic tile is a versatile choice if you’re looking for solids, patterns, or the look of natural materials like marble or slate. Its water-resistant qualities make it function well in the bathroom. <span class="s1"></span>Brooke and Sam fashioned a perfectly balanced style in their powder room. Wood-looking ceramic tile was the right neutral to complement a black-and-white floral wallpaper in a large-scale pattern.</p>
<p class="p1">Initially, Nicole thought she wanted an all-white bathroom for her basement. She decided, however, to let this room give the bottom floor the personality it was missing. Thanks to her Sweeten contractor, she had guidance with material selections. So, Nicole settled on a 16” x 16” patterned gray ceramic floor tile. Depending on shape and color, <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>expect to spend between $3.50–$40 per square foot.</p>

<h3>Hexagon tile</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45008 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3.jpg" alt="hexagon bathroom floor tiles" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>(<em>Top photo</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara and Brian&#8217;s bath</a>; (<em>bottom photo</em>) Hexagon floor tile in an all-white bathroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Tara and Brian&#8217;s bath, dark hexagon tile paired with light grout grounds the design and gives it a modern vibe.</p>
<p><span class="s1"></span>A Sweeten homeowner in Prospect Heights chose classic white on white for her bathroom renovation. Except for a few modern black finishes, her marble hex floor tile has the graphic pattern of a honeycomb. Expect prices to be between $5–$45+ per square foot. <span class="s1"></span>Marble and ceramic start at around $15 per square foot, and porcelain at $10.</p>
<h3>Penny tile</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="cost of bathroom tile with gradient blue and white penny tile" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56694" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29227 " title="mosaic penny tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom tile costs" width="769" height="1151" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />
(<em>Top photo</em>) Katy&#8217;s blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny bath tile</a>; (<em>b</em><em>ottom photo</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/penny-tile-beige-bath-blue-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Michael’s shower</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Penny tile is a classic option that gives off major vintage vibes. The goldfish artwork, created by artist and Sweeten homeowner Katy Garry, inspired the dappling of gradient white and blue penny tile. It covers her bathroom from floor to ceiling invoking the sense of being in the water. In Brooklyn, Rachel and Michael’s shower renovation transformed it into a waterfall mosaic. Penny tile is a type of inexpensive floor tile, costing as little as $5 per square foot for white porcelain. The price increases to $18 or more for colorful mosaics.</p>
<h3>Basketweave</h3>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Basketweave is truly old-school, but it’s been making a steady comeback. For example, in Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s master bathroom, it feels surprisingly modern as part of the minimalist design. In Tara and Mike’s bath, the tile lends itself to a more traditional look without making the space feel dated. Porcelain, a material used in inexpensive bathroom tile, can cost around $8 per square foot; high-quality marble begins around $30 per square foot.</p>

<h3>Remodeling for a fresher aesthetic</h3>
<p>Erica purchased her first apartment, a one-bedroom in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. “Everything was in working order, but my hope was to eventually fully gut and renovate the kitchen and bathroom,” she said. First the kitchen, and two years later decided the bathroom’s time had come. The all-pink-everything (the toilet, tub, sink, and wall tiles) had to go. “I knew I wanted a more zen, spa-like bathroom without the added expense of switching the location of the existing plumbing,” she shared.</p>

<p>Ready to get started, Erica posted her project to Sweeten. “Sweeten was extremely attentive to my needs as I searched for a contractor,” she shared. After reviewing her options of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local general contractors</a> in Brooklyn, she hired one to work with. Then, her renovation team—her Sweeten general contractor and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interior designer Amy E. Bishop</a>—joined forces to revamp Erica’s bathroom into a relaxing retreat.</p>
<h4>Key design element: hexagon tiles in the bathroom</h4>
<p>They developed a design that would maximize style and storage. Amy and Erica created a Pinterest board to share ideas, and the designer helped guide the overall look, starting with a three-drawer vanity the homeowner loved. As they were finalizing their concept, Erica’s mom pointed out the lack of a backsplash behind the vanity might be an issue, calling her &#8220;a splasher.&#8221; Hence, they designed a backsplash with hexagon tiles in the bathroom. The cascading formation carried over from the shower wall, offered a creative and practical solution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="Hexagon tiled shower wall with large vanity mirror over sink and backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="678" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48825" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11-300x203.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-11-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="Light pink bathroom with built in shower niche and bathrobe hook after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48821" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Erica-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Storage in a small bathroom</h3>
<p>With limited space, the storage options would get creative. Shelves above the door hold toilet paper and other supplies, while a large medicine cabinet and custom in-shower shelves host Erica’s growing collection of skincare and beauty products. Her general contractor played an integral part in executing the custom idea. The original design placed the shelves on a different wall. However, once her contractor discovered it was solid cement, they relocated the double-stacked niches to the bathroom&#8217;s back wall accented by the hexagon tiles. The contracting team also made sure all the electrical was up to code (which wasn’t the case before they came in).</p>

<h3>Hexagon tiles in a bathroom bring on the calm</h3>
<p>Living with her cat Gigi onsite throughout the renovation and using the powder room in her building’s laundry room were the biggest hardships Erica experienced during the five-week renovation. They were well-worth the sacrifice.</p>
<p>“I absolutely love the bathroom!  Everything is so fresh and clean with a much more sophisticated color palette and design. With my enormous medicine cabinet, shower niches, vanity, and shelving over the door, I appreciate the ability to be much more organized getting ready for work in the morning,” Erica said.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Choosing tile for your bathroom floor and walls is the fun part for many. Often a particular tile is spotted and is a &#8220;must-have&#8221; and the space is designed around it. The tile becomes the focal point. Other times a fixture style or a certain color palette is leading the design. In this case, the tile would be chosen as a supporting—but important—background role. In terms of price, the bathroom tile costs for a remodel will range depending on colorway, material, shape, pattern, and finish.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve rounded up popular looks to guide your search and the prices you can expect to pay. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractor</a> will hire the right subcontractor depending on the type of tile being installed. </p>

<p>If you’re looking to showcase a single feature in the bathroom, consider the herringbone pattern. Sweeten homeowners Mitzie and Jenifer laid down their floor with cement tile in Federal Blue. Katherine and Gus set matte black fixtures against a pale green ceramic tile on the backsplash and shower wall.</p>
<h4>Cost for herringbone tile styles</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Herringbone bathroom tile costs start around $3 per piece and can go up to $17 per piece. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Jill’s bath, a bold black hexagon floor tile balances a long double-sink vanity. The tile can also exhibit a softer side in a neutral color as seen on Erica&#8217;s shower wall. Check out her creative backsplash design idea. Lia and Chris&#8217; smaller scale on the floor can resemble a mosaic. The smaller the tile, the more grout is used, helping with the grip on the floor so it&#8217;s less slippery.  </p>
<h4>Cost for hexagon tile styles</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Porcelain hexagon bathroom tile costs start at around $10 per square foot; marble begins at around $15 per square foot.</p>

<h3><b>Subway tile: A go-to classic design</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten homeowners Nikki and Chris aimed for a prewar look. Iconic of old New York, white subway tile lined the shower and halfway up the bathroom walls. The white tile was the right background for their decorative black-and-gold pineapple wallpaper. </p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost of subway tile</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Standard ceramic subway tile costs around $2 – $3 per square foot. The cost increases with marble around $6 – $9 per square foot.</p>
<h3><b>Subway tile variation</b></h3>

<p>A longer subway tile has been growing in popularity. It has just enough variation to give off a contemporary vibe. Sweeten homeowner Katy&#8217;s master bathroom mixes a glossy subway tile with a patterned hex in black and white. Steve and Lewis went with a tumbled, handmade slimmer variation in cerulean blue for a small niche half bathroom.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost of elongated subway tile</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an elegant variation on the subway tile, a 3&#8243; x 12&#8243; tile in polished ceramic spans a price range between $4 – $16 per square foot.</p>
<h3><b>Penny tile</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Penny tile is a classic option that gives off major vintage vibes. It works as floor tile in Alicia and Ed’s retro-inspired bath and transforms into a waterfall mosaic in Rachel and Michael’s shower.</p>
<h4>Cost for penny tile</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This kind of bathroom tile can range from $2 per square foot for porcelain to $10 or more for colorful mosaics.</p>
<h3><b>Basketweave tile</b></h3>

It feels surprisingly modern as part of the minimalist design in Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s master bathroom. A variety of tile patterns coexist in Cory and Andrew&#8217;s bathroom. For the couple, the basketweave design complemented the penny tile and herringbone shapes. </p>
<h4>Cost for basketweave tile</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bathroom tile costs for lower-end options, like porcelain, cost around $4 per square foot. Expect high-quality marble to begin at $15 per square foot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>This eye-catching design is having a moment</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its familiar broken zigzag is something you’ve probably seen before in a tweed suit or jacket, calling to mind the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Chanel. From fashion to home design, this elegant pattern—expressed in a range of materials—makes a big impact. Below, eight homeowners make herringbone their own.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A peek of oak herringbone underneath old carpeting inspired <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/prewar-apartment-estate-sale-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kasey</a> to restore the original floors in his prewar apartment. During his renovation, he discovered that the floors were in near perfect condition. A light <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touch-up</a> was all that was needed to return them to their former glory.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry</a> splurged on herringbone <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walnut floors</a> in the kitchen and downstairs parlor, which quickly became one of their favorite features in the townhouse. The pattern, combined with the warmth of the stain, adds plenty of interest and texture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30403 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-new-2-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Looking for something more durable than wood, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito</a> chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porcelain tile</a> with imitation grain to give the appearance of polished white oak. Their contractor laid the tile in a herringbone pattern to punch up the muted tones of the kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30397 size-chrono" title="herringbone backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-new-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wanting some &#8220;wow&#8221; in the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed</a> decided that subway tile was firmly off limits. Instead, the couple chose cream-colored marble laid in a herringbone pattern for a touch of warmth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30398 size-chrono" title="herringbone backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-03-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To inject some color into his all-white kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/home-improves-view-inside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gall</a> chose a gold-toned herringbone backsplash comprised of glass and marble tile. The combination of different materials and colors provides a refreshing update on a classic design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24172 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren and Ross</a> covered every inch of their master bath in marble. For the floor, they chose a white herringbone tile and paired it with fine lines of gray grout for some subtle contrast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27183 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-19-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana and Leo</a> amped up the drama in their modern guest bathroom with herringbone mosaic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile</a> in shades of gray. The addition is the perfect complement to the minimal design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24332 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile in the shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an all-white theme in mind, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cecilia and Jonathan</a> wanted to keep things bright and shiny in their full bath. A slight deviation from the plan inspired an accent wall of veined marble subway tile laid in a herringbone pattern.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 5 remodeling projects prove that with a $15-20K budget, homeowners can get <em>a lot</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tiles are popping off the wall, the toilet makes a strange gurgling sound when it flushes, and stepping into the shower feels like entering a dark closet. If this situation sounds familiar, then your bathroom is ready for an upgrade. But what will it cost? A $15k-20k budget is an excellent range to cover all the basic bathroom renovation costs—materials, installation, and labor included—for a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet</a>, sink, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanity</a>, fixtures, tile, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a>. With that in mind, it’s also important to consider that the need for plumbing, electrical, or layout changes will likely add to the amount. <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors showcases five of their bathroom remodels below as</span> good examples of what a $15K-20K budget will allow.</p>
<h3>$15k takes the blues away in a Brooklyn bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26277 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchasing a 1910 brick row house, Allison and Jovito got to work on a serious renovation, starting with the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom hadn’t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue—blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub—all in white—replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.</p>
<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1066" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono" title="$17k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1064" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.</p>
<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the ‘80s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.</p>
<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="509" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turn an old, run-down bathroom into something elegant and calming</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Mary Ann and Frank’s three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment had done its job since they had bought it in 1992.  But now, with their two kids grown and gone, the couple pulled the trigger on a long-planned master bathroom upgrade. “Our co-op building was built in 1929 and it was the bath from 1929<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></i>same tub, same tiles,” said Mary Ann, who works in publishing. Grime on the tiles wouldn’t budge and some tiles were no longer there at all. Paint peeled off the walls and with no vanity, shampoo bottles were always on prime display. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: To keep the costs down, the couple kept the original layout. But that was all they kept. What they wanted was a stylish sanctuary beginning with a hex tile bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hexagons were laid on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> topped off the vanity for a refined look. The shower also has matching marble tiles. Their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> suggested painting, not tiling, the wall opposite the shower and vanity. Rather than feeling enclosed, the bathroom now feels “more like a room,” said Mary Ann, “and plus it would have been a lot of cleaning.” They did lose storage space in their master and hall bathroom, which they also renovated. However, a large vanity and two large mirrors with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> built into the wall that were added to the master bathroom made up for that. When you open each mirror, there is also another magnifying mirror. The vanity has six large drawers and two cabinets for storing toilet paper and cleaning supplies. &#8220;We were just going for a more calmer, less cluttered look,” said Mary Ann. “Now, everything is put away.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Mary Ann’s centerpiece is a walk-in shower so large “you can do yoga in it.” The old tub was decommissioned and replaced with a walk-in shower with glass walls. “It’s so much fun to take a shower now,” said Mary Ann.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Whether granite slabs or a full-on marble bathroom, natural stone offers durability, resistance to bacteria, and the flexibility to match every style</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20725 size-chrono" title="natural stone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg" alt="natural stone" width="723" height="496" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Laura and Peter&#8217;s bathroom features <a href="https://Sink, shower, wall and floor tiles in marble shower" target="_blank">floor-to-ceiling marble</a>, including radiant heat flooring</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to the bathroom, nothing says luxury like real stone. Covering a wide price range, it makes it an easy go-to when designing the bath space. </span><span class="s1">Greater accessibility to quarries, wider distribution, and competition from dealers have all made this possible. An impervious (or nearly) surface also makes it suitable for almost every surface from walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floors</a>, countertops, and tub surrounds. Not all natural stone is alike, however. Some are more durable than others but with thoughtful attention to use and placement, you can enjoy this classic material in the bath. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing real stone</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Typically, the most common reason to choose one stone over another is to achieve a specific aesthetic,” says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank">Sweeten contractor Phil</a>. “There are just some specific nuances that people look for that can only be found in a specific stone.”</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b></b>The most popular choice for stone in the bath is marble, thanks to its timeless appearance. Before you make your decision, consider other natural elements each with their own distinctive qualities. </span><span class="s1">Granite, travertine, and slate are all hard stones that hold up well to water in the bath, and each offers a particular look. Shop around as every slab is unique.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Think about where you would like to see it used. Will it be used to cover vertical and horizontal surfaces, or as an accent? If you’re working with a strict budget, you can enjoy a small application of stone, as a border around porcelain tile or behind the sink, or as a slab for the countertop. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Marble</span></span><span class="s2"> <b><br />
</b></span><span class="s1">A classic and versatile option, marble works in both traditional and contemporary settings. Distinguished by rich veins, it comes in many shades of white, as well as subtle grays, pale gold, and black. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Among the most popular are the white marbles: Calacatta and Carrara. The veins on Calacatta tend to be bolder than those on Carrara. Calacatta Gold, as its name indicates, includes gold-colored flecks. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Crema Marfil offers a creamier tone, almost like ivory. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Bardiglio is a deep gray stone with a blend of paler gray and black veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Nero Marquino is a black marble with white veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">All of these marbles take a polished or matte finish. On a floor, use a matte surface or a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank">mosaic</a>. The smaller pieces, with lots of grout lines, help prevent slipping.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Marble is one of the more porous materials. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it. Ask the fabricator to recommend a sealant product. “Homeowners can seal stone themselves, and there are many easy-to-use solutions on the market,” says Phil. Seal the stone first when it’s installed, and twice a year or so. “The frequency can vary due to use and location,” he says. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it several times a year, and you may have to tackle mildew if you place it in your shower pan, where water is likely to hit it daily.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Granite</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>For many years, granite was a favorite countertop for kitchens. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s harder than most stones and nonporous so it can take moisture in the bath.</span> The pattern tends to be more granular than marble making it easier to coordinate with other designs. It comes in many more colors—whites, grays, and browns, as well as blues, greens, and reds. Install it as a slab as a countertop, or if you want to go all the way, apply slabs to the walls and tiles on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Travertine</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>Like marble, travertine conjures luxury. Think ancient monuments and historic buildings (Sacré Coeur in Paris). The surface pattern combines subtle veins and fine granular patterns for a rustic look. Honed or tumbled finishes soften the effect. Colors range from cream or ivory to earthier golds and browns.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Slate</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>A fine-grained stone, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank">slate</a> comes in variations of blues, greens, browns, and grays for an elegant yet rustic look. When finished, it’s not as smooth as marble or granite. This makes it more naturally slip-resistant but still needs to be sealed.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Check for variations<br />
</b></span><span class="s1"><b><b><br />
</b></b></span>Stone is mined from a quarry, not manufactured, so each piece is unique. Color can vary by a lot, so if purchasing stone tile, ask to see the identification on all the boxes and be sure they go together. Buy an extra box in the case of repairs so the replacement tiles match.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Choose the finish</b></span></p>
<p>Marble and granite can take many different finishes—polished, honed, tumbled. There are a couple of new finish treatments called “leather” and “flamed” that polish the surface to a matte effect while playing up some of the grain.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Caring for your floors</b></span></p>
<p>Every natural stone requires sealing before it is installed and then periodically afterward. Frequency depends on the stone type and the amount of traffic received. If your bath sees activity every day, particularly from shoes, put down an area rug to catch grit and scuffs. Make sure the rug is rubber-backed so it doesn’t slip.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider the pros and cons</b></span></p>
<p>If you want natural, unique surfaces in the bath, stone makes a great choice.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• It resists water, bacteria, odor, and fire. Wet areas, like the shower, will require </span><span class="s1">a waterproof membrane underneath. Factor in regular maintenance, such as sealing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• As hard as stone is, it’s also at risk from scratching, so lift furniture instead of sliding it, and sweep regularly to remove grit.  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Cracking can occur without proper installation, so make sure your contractor prepares an even subfloor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing a damaged area can be difficult and costly. This is particularly true if the area is large. Play it safe with tiles or mosaic on the floor, where damage, if any, is more likely to occur from a dropped item. The smaller-sized tile and mosaics make it easier to replace a piece or two.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Naturally cool, the material is a bonus in summer, but not so nice in winter on bare feet. Since natural stone transmits heat well, installing radiant heating before the tile is set may be a nice perk.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Faux stone and alternatives</b></span></p>
<p>With the recent refinements in high-definition printing, the look of stone is convincingly reproduced in porcelain tile. Porcelain is fired with a glaze making it impervious to water and less likely to scratch. This means it doesn’t have to be sealed regularly. At 3/8-inch thick, it’s also thinner and lighter than stone. The lighter weight makes it cheaper to ship, bringing down the cost.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Check out quartz, like Dekton and Caesarstone. This man-made material incorporates finely ground stone in a high-pressure manufacturing process to produce a surfacing material that is as hard as the real thing and claims to be impervious to stains </span><span class="s1">from liquids like wine and cooking oils. This super-hard quality requires less maintenance than real stone and contributes to the recent growth in popularity of quartz. Because it is a man-made material, you have more control over the appearance. </span><span class="s1">Manufacturers offer faux stone looks as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and colors, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Stone in the bath is an investment of time and money. Your payback is a unique yet timeless look that, with a little attention to regular maintenance, will afford you with a room that you can enjoy for your lifetime.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Range with white tile backsplash and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Consult manufacturers’ manuals for appliance care</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An obvious first renovation aftercare step that many homeowners skip. Most appliance manufacturers have a place on their webpage dedicated to manuals or product service and support. A model number will lead you to literature on cleaning and maintenance. Often, a simple Google search is enough. For example, a stainless wine refrigerator requires little attention except for periodically washing off fingerprints. This can be done with water and mild dish soap, then polished with a microfiber cloth dipped in mineral, cooking or olive oil. Note: Clean and polish with the grain. Look closely! Steel has grain just like wood. Here are extra tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://amzn.to/44JR5ag">Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes or Liquid Spray</a> work great</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Register major appliances with the manufacturer through their website.</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you know the model numbers for future reference &#8212; often they are on the back of the machine so take a picture or write it down for future reference.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak with your contractor about how to maintain your equipment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Safeguard your kitchen countertops</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You probably reviewed pros and cons of different materials before you made your final decision of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/">kitchen countertops</a>. Ready to start cooking? Here’s a refresh!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><strong>Quartz countertops</strong>, such as <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caesarstone</a>, are durable, non-porous and do not need to be annually resealed, but acidic foods or juices can erode the acrylic. This material is also more likely to be damaged by excessive heat than granite, crushed glass or concrete. Treat yourself to trivets.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Porous natural stones</strong>, such as granite and marble, may need to be resealed periodically and are susceptible to stains from oils and acids. Don’t let spilled liquids sit on your stone countertops. Spill? Swipe! Accidents happen &#8212; <a href="https://amzn.to/44LtExe">this etch remover</a> can be a lifesaver</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate or solid-surfacing countertops</strong>, in this case, renovation aftercare means cutting boards are mandatory because both of these materials are easily scratched.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp" alt="Shower with green and white patterned tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57255" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Tend to your tiles</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/">Bathroom tiles</a> get hazy with soapy residue, while kitchen backsplashes get splattered with oil, and floor tiles experience both! Regular cleaning will prevent the need to muscle through buildup, so break out a mild all-purpose cleaner and some basic cleaning equipment.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">For kitchen backsplash tiles, mix dish liquid with water and rub away the oily residue with a sponge or gentle cloth. White vinegar mixed with warm water is another option. A mild all-purpose cleaner will clean up bath tiles nicely. Mix the solution with water and wipe with a rag, a soft brush or sponge.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweep or vacuum floor tiles of any debris and grit on a regular basis to avoid dulling or scratching the surface. After clearing away large particles, use a mop and bucket with mild soap or detergent and warm water. If you wind up with a hazy film, consider switching up your mop material (sponge to chamois, for example) and/or wipe away the film with a fresh cloth and an all-purpose cleaner.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Seal your grout! Where there is tile, there is grout. <a href="https://amzn.to/3EusDPF">Use a sealant like this one</a>. For renovation aftercare for your grout, use gentle brushes to scrub it clean. And if your regular tile cleaning routine is not doing the trick on your grout, try a paste of baking soda and water, a mild bleach solution or store-bought grout cleaner. Remember to reseal grout periodically.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>4. Work with your wood</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Refinished or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand new hardwoods</a> can be beautiful foundations for your home. If you are the type of family that takes off your shoes before entering the home, you are off to a great start! Even if not, caring for your floors can be easy with a few simple guidelines.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Begin your flooring renovation aftercare by placing indoor and outdoor welcome mats. Mats placed before and after the threshold of your door are an important first step in maintaining scratch- and stain-free floors even in the winter.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Area rugs cut down on regular wear and tear on the floors in the areas where they are positioned.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Little felt stickers (<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z7SqXp">like these</a>) do a good job protecting your floors from furniture-driven scratches.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few rules of thumb when cleaning your floors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sweep or vacuum debris on a regular basis</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mop with water and a gentle soap and never leave water or other liquids sitting on your hardwoods. Water can eventually penetrate the finish and leave stains in the wood. If you are not sure what cleaner to use on your floors, manufacturers of wood sealants often offer hardwood floor cleaners, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3RcK4vs">Minwax® Hardwood Floor Cleaner</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Laura-pantry-09-scaled.gif" alt="Moving image off renovator in custom cabinets" width="1706" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57343" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Care for your cabinets</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although you likely will not be cleaning your kitchen or bathroom cabinets as often as higher-traffic surfaces (such as shower tiles and cooking countertops), don’t forget about them!  </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Knobs and pulls can harbor germs and cabinet doors can become grimy over time from moisture and oils in the air. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly to hardwood floors, wooden cabinets don’t do well with water or other liquids resting on their surface.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you clean your cabinets with soapy water, white vinegar water or mild all-purpose cleaner, remember these vital last steps: wipe away cleaner residue with a wet cloth and dry your cabinets with a towel.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tile revamps ho-hum walls and floors in an instant—from tile flooring to backsplash tile.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22453 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Geometric tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Geometric tile backsplash in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet&#8217;s Crown Heights kitchen</a><span class="img-label"> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;<br />
Your choice in tile can influence the entire space it occupies. Here is how <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur and Kate</a> used stacked patterns in minimalist fashion, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly</a> went bold with cement tile on the floor but subtly glamorous on the wall. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet’s</a> geometric backsplash become the kitchen’s centerpiece, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s</a> subtle 3D tile struck a perfect balance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The decisions to be made when designing a kitchen can be daunting—the sheer number alone, let alone the anxiety. Will this material work in the cook space? Will it hold up? Will I still like it in five years? Factor in a growing family and those worries begin to multiply: What if the kids drop their juice boxes; will it stain? What if my child falls&#8230;will he hurt himself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides looks and function, you need to consider what type of traffic the flooring will experience. Is it off the garage or a deck, where dirt can be tracked in? Do you also have pets that can scratch with claws or bring water and dirt from outside? Is your child in a high chair that gets dragged around frequently in one area, or has he graduated to his own mini vehicle during playtime, adding to the wear and tear? Health is a factor, too, of course, and any flooring that is manufactured and/or has a finish should be able to provide a rating for its various contents and performance, including VOC emission and slippage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take all of these factors into account as you consider the following materials underfoot. The good news: You can install just about whatever you want, and, with a few precautions, continue to enjoy it as your family grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hardwood</strong><br />
Sought out for its natural elegance, wood also delivers a lot: It offers a slight pliancy underfoot so items you drop are less likely to break than on a harder surface such as tile. The two basic wood options:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solid wood</strong></span><br />
If you love solid wood, opt for prefinished floors (aka, “factory finished”) that come from the factory with a hard-wearing top coat of aluminum oxide urethane that offers protection from scratches while minimizing upkeep, like waxing; daily sweeping should do it. Ask your dealer about the warranty, which should be provided by the manufacturer and not the installer, so you have greater recourse if the floor needs a major or immediate repair. This type of floor also can be refinished, as long as the dings are not too deep. If your preference is for hardwood but you worry about those dings, take a look at “distressed” styles that can disguise any new dents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: This type of floor will fade with regular exposure to sunlight, so don’t put it by a window that ushers in strong daily outdoor sun. You also need to think about exposure to moisture—say, a leak at the dishwasher or fridge, or water constantly splashed by the sink. And if your toddler drops food by the high chair, you will want to take a precaution and put a mat underneath, to prevent spotting or stains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engineered wood</strong></span><br />
The other option in this category is engineered wood flooring, which is made of a thin veneer of real wood attached to structural plywood. It should cost a little less than solid wood, but depending on the thickness of the veneer, you may not be able to refinish it, making it not such a thrifty choice after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Formaldehyde, used as an adhesive, can be found in some engineered wood floors, including bamboo (see below), but at the present time this chemical is not strictly regulated, so you need to inquire with the salesperson or manufacturer with regard to any floor made with pressed wood or medium density fiberboard (MDF).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bamboo</strong><br />
Although actually a grass, bamboo is sold with hardwoods for many of the same reasons—looks natural and warm, endures light to medium wear, is easy underfoot. Most bamboo flooring is made of a bamboo veneer attached to a backing such as plywood or MDF. But you need to be mindful of quality. Bamboo gets treated with many chemicals to turn it into a material suitable for flooring so off-gassing can be a factor. Also, this relative newcomer to flooring has many manufacturing sources and quality control is not yet highly regulated. Investigate thoroughly, as with any product you bring into your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate</strong><br />
This type of flooring is similar to laminate countertops, in that it is composed of dense fiberboard topped with a photographic image of a real wood (or other material) that is then topped with a clear protective layer. With the development of HD printing, laminate offers a lot of different wood looks, and you can mix several styles (e.g., a pale oak with a colored border) to achieve some fun effects. It tends to resist light scratching and fading from sunlight. And that hollow sound that turned off many homeowners once upon a time has been eliminated by many manufacturers that incorporate underneath a sound-muffling material like cork. Laminate is installed as a “floating floor,” which means there’s no glue or nails. Boards connect by means of an interlocking tongue and groove design. Since there’s no need to connect the boards to a subfloor, they can be installed over any uneven surface as long as it’s sealed and remains dry. This makes laminate a good solution till little ones are more grown up if you want to replace it eventually with tile or real wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Laminate wears well but like wood, it won’t withstand prolonged exposure to water, and it’s slippery when wet. Also, it can’t be refinished; if there’s damage, you’ll have to replace the entire board so order extra to have an exact match if needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resilient</strong><br />
Mostly vinyl falls into this category, but there’s also linoleum. As the term “resilient” indicates, this flooring is easy on humans, when little ones fall or adults stand for long periods when prepping a meal, and if you drop a dish, it’s less likely to break on this surface than on tile or even wood. It also handles a lot of wear or sunlight and resists stains from food and drink spills as well as crayons and magic markers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vinyl</strong></span><br />
Recent advances in manufacturing have improved performance since the days when vinyl was for your grandmother’s laundry room. You can now find vinyl that infuses the surface with cultured diamond particles for increased protection against dents, scratches, scuffs, and stains. HD printing advancements allow you to choose a vinyl that really looks like wood or tile. Peer closely, though, and you’ll know it’s vinyl, but the faux effects can be part of its fashion-forward appeal. Vinyl remains probably your thriftiest choice, depending on the pattern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Linoleum</strong></span><br />
Linoleum is sought for its range of saturated colors or marbled effects, resiliency, slip resistance and everyday wear. It comes in sheets, for an almost seamless appearance, as well as tiles if you want a classic checkerboard or just like that look. Made of linseed oil and other naturally sourced materials, linoleum is marketed as a “green” flooring choice, but in fact, it requires chemicals, too, to arrive at the finished product, so ask the salesperson about off-gassing and VOC ratings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Both wear well but can’t be refinished. Buy extra in case of repairs so you can match the area you need to patch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tile</strong><br />
While tile comes in both ceramic and porcelain, the latter is the harder of the two and thus more appropriate for most floors that see a lot of foot traffic. Completely resistant to fading, scratches, and moisture, tile is good for a busy household. And since it’s sealed with a fired-on glaze, it’s good if allergies are an issue, but you will want to take some precautions with youngsters in the house. Until children are old enough where toddling and falling is not an issue, use a rug in areas where little ones congregate. An expansive indoor/outdoor area rug that can be taken outside and hosed off will help protect little ones while adding a splash of colorful style. Many tiles are slip resistant since they are used in commercial areas, so ask the salesperson about this rating, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Dishware will break on this super-hard surface, and tile can crack if not installed by a pro on a perfectly smooth surface. A rug that protects little ones may have to be cleaned regularly.</p>
