										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Get an edge by installing connected smart home technology during your home remodel</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48936 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg" alt="Image of smart home technology in a shower" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home technology is everywhere today. It has made its way into our vehicles, our workplaces, and our pockets. With smart tech’s skill at automation, it’s no surprise that it has found a perfect place in the home. Nearly<a href="https://cta.tech/Resources/i3-Magazine/i3-Issues/2020/January-February/The-Ringing-Future-of-Smart-Home-Technology"> <span class="s2">70-percent of homes</span></a> already own some type of smart home tech. And that number is only growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some forms of smart home tech are more permanent. Sweeten outlines which ones can best be incorporated during a home remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters and controllers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from being smart, the average water heater is more like a blunt tool. It maintains hot water even when you don’t need hot water. Or if you turned it down before a vacation, you’ll need to manually turn it back up when you return. It can take hours for the water to heat up again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters connect to your home’s internet through Wi-Fi. This gives you remote access to all of the water heater’s functions. You can adjust temperature and set schedules. You can even monitor the status and shut it down if there’s a problem. This gives you a chance to call in a technician and avert disastrous water leaks.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart electrochromic (self-tinting) glass windows</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a sunny climate, you know the constant routine of lowering and raising blinds to control inside temperatures. Even northern zones experience peak sunny periods during the summer.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass darkens or lightens automatically in response to solar changes throughout the day. No blinds are required and nothing physically moves. While the windows require power for this operation, the amount of power is minimal. For 2,000 square feet of glass, the electricity required would only power a 60V-watt light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass is truly cutting-edge smart home technology. It is still not widely available. But it is worth looking into if you live in places with heavy solar and heat demands.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart connected appliances</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do all of your home’s separate appliances work as one? Probably not. Likely, they perform their own duties separately. A new and smarter option is to consider them as components of a larger system. According to<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/smart_home_tips"> <span class="s2">EnergyStar</span></a>, appliances with connected functionality use less energy than conventional appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a two-part system. One, you’ll need to purchase smart appliances with that next big remodeling project. That includes refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, and dishwashers. Two, you’ll need a unifying management system that can recognize and operate those appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EnergyStar’s SHEMS program is one program that is available for free. Google Home is another popular program that acts as a hub for an ever-growing number of smart devices.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home security systems</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, “smart” was the missing link of home security systems. Home alarms would report to an off-site monitoring center. From there, a call would be placed to local police and to the homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But smart security systems put homeowners front-and-center and keep them informed. That information is dually shared with the monitoring center and homeowner in real-time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While wireless security systems are popular, wired systems do have strong points. Cameras with wires running through attics or behind walls are difficult to tamper with. A hidden or locked-up digital video recorder (DVR) records hundreds or thousands of hours. Wireless cameras with SD cards record a few hours before rolling over and erasing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart radiant wall heating</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On cold nights, hot air gushing from the central heating system’s vents is a welcome feeling. But if you were to watch with a thermal imaging camera, you’d see just how inefficient this is. Orange and yellow areas of warm air build up in some areas. Blue and green spots indicate places where the heat does not reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Large radiant heating panels mounted on the walls evenly distribute the warm air. A thermostat notices that the room is cold. It signals to a smart controller located in a separate area. That signal is relayed to a manifold, which sends hot water from a boiler to the radiant heating panels.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water monitors</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your home may already have a smart water meter on the street. Installed by the water company, this meter reports the level of your usage wirelessly to the company. This is what generates your monthly bill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a similar device that you own and control. A licensed plumber splices the smart water monitor (not meter) into your home’s water supply line. The monitor communicates with your home’s Wi-Fi system. With an app, you can track your water consumption and can make adjustments to save water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, a smart water monitor can sense unusual fluctuations in the water flow. These fluctuations may indicate a break in one of the pipes. Since the monitor is located at the start of the pipes, it can shut down all water to the house. This can stop devastating water line breaks before they happen.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart garage door openers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garage doors remote controls are helpful, but they have a very limited radius. With a smartphone, you can control a smart garage door from anywhere you have a cell phone connection. You might be halfway to work and you think that you forgot to close the door. With the app, you can verify whether you did. If so, you can shut it remotely. Or you might need to open the garage door because a neighbor wants to borrow your mower. Smart garage doors expand the reach of the old remote control.</span></p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay but choosing a few or even just one device or smart home technology system can offer a convenient way to stay on top of the inner mechanics of your home.</p>

Increasingly, we are seeing renovation projects aimed at resale.

<h3><strong>Should You Remodel for Resale?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re moving sooner rather than later, your renovation should be strategic and targeted in the areas that will create the biggest difference to buyers with minimal cost to you. Walk around your home with your real estate agent and discuss whether there are any basic improvement projects that might facilitate a quick sale for top dollar. While decluttering and staging should be the first steps, some homes do need some extra work. If yours falls into this category, <b>ask yourself the following questions:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I willing to accept a lower price per square foot to compensate for the condition of the home?</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I scared off by the hassle of a renovation project?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer to both questions is no, it sounds like a renovation might be in your future!</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Apartments</h3>
<p>If you live in an apartment, there is usually another entity—a co-op or condo board—in conjunction with a management company, who is responsible for the upkeep of the building systems and its exterior, as well as any landscaping. Neither you nor the buyer of your apartment will need to deal with these issues personally (unless you’re on the board, but that’s a whole different story.) As an owner, you’re responsible for “walls-in,” so it makes sense to focus on cosmetic improvements that will help your apartment show better.</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Houses</h3>
<p>The priorities are different when renovating a house for resale. Since homeowners are responsible for the whole building and the lot on which the house sits, there will likely be more pressing concerns beyond the color of the bedroom walls. (Also, buyers of townhouses generally expect to do some work on their new homes after closing.) This means that your money shouldn’t go to renovations but to repairs: ensuring that all systems are in good working order, that there are no structural issues, and that nothing on the exterior needs immediate attention.</p>
<p>You’ll generally have to dig deeper into your pockets to fund these types of projects, but it’s likely that your house will sit on the market if you don’t address them. If you don’t deal with pressing repairs, and they come up during inspection, expect the buyer to ask for credits at closing in order to compensate for them.</p>
<h3><span class="s1">The best interior </span><span class="s1">home upgrades for </span><span class="s1">resale value</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tip: Focus your time and money on remodeling the most visible parts of your home. This approach tends to bring the best value (we’ll address exterior updates further down.) These are the interior, whole-room projects that recoup the most home resale value according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, minor kitchen remodel that costs $23,452 has a resale value of $18,206 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, major kitchen remodel that costs $68,490 has a resale value of $40,127 and recoups <b>58%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom remodel that costs $21,377 has a resale value of $13,688 and recoups<b> 64%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale bathroom remodel that costs $67,106 has a resale value of $37,995 and recoups <b>56%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom addition that costs $49,598 has a resale value of $26,807 and recoups<b> 54%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Small </span><span class="s1">home resale upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Add a fresh coat of paint. </b>Especially if the current colors are very bright or unusual. You might love lime green, but it’s safe to say that many buyers won’t. Many homeowners can repaint themselves, but sometimes, it’s worth calling in the pros.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Change out kitchen cabinet fronts.</b> You can do this in a few different ways—simply sanding and repainting the existing surface is the most budget-friendly, or you can choose to replace the doors and hardware while leaving the interior boxes in place. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Swap out your fixtures.</b>  If your lighting and plumbing fixtures look like they are from the ’80s—and not in a good way—consider switching them out. You don’t need to go high-end; there are plenty of good-looking options at big box stores. Our suggestion? Pick something with clean lines and classic finishes. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Refinish your floors.</b> If they are scratched, peeling, or look damaged, this is a must. Any sign of water damage, for example, is not only an aesthetic problem but is also an indicator to buyers that there may be a history of leaks in the building. And if you have carpets…this is a huge turnoff for many buyers, so consider replacing them.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Rip out outdated trends that serve no function</b>. This applies to vinyl faux-wood paneling, weird glass block walls, and “decorative” room dividers that are now just eyesores.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Single-space </span><span class="s1">home upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen updates.</b> This is an important room for buyers and is often immediately visible upon entering an apartment, so you’ll want to focus your attention here. In addition to refurbishing the cabinet doors, replace the hardware and fixtures. You can also go further and replace the countertops and backsplash. Visually, these make the biggest impact. If you have a very dark kitchen, going lighter will appeal to buyers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom updates. </b>After the kitchen, this is the most important space in an apartment. Particularly if there is just one—it’s important to make it look functional and clean. The easiest and most affordable ways to update the bath are to paint and change out the medicine cabinet mirror for an updated model. Updating the tile, vanity, and reglazing the tub will also be good ways to freshen up the space.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>“Flex space” addition</b>. While it’s impossible to add actual square footage to an apartment (unless you’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/"><span class="s2">combining apartments</span></a>), it’s often helpful to add the idea of one. This can be done by putting up pressurized walls to carve out an office nook, or by adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/"><span class="s2">sliding doors </span></a>across a large living room to create a den space. While this type of renovation won’t change the legal designation of the number of bedrooms in your unit, it helps buyers envision more uses for the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">The best exterior home upgrades for resale value</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale garage door replacement that costs $3,695 has a resale value of $3,491 and recoups <b>94%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing vinyl siding with mid-range manufactured stone veneer costs on average $9,357 has a resale value of $8,943 and recoups <b>95%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range wooden deck addition that costs $14,360 has a resale value of $10,355 and recoups <b>72%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range fiber-cement siding replacement that costs $17,008 has a resale value of $13,195 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing a mid-range steel entry door for a cost of $1,881 has a resale value of $1,294 and recoups <b>68%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Curb appeal project ideas</h4>
<p>Curb appeal catches the eye of prospective buyers. Consider these exterior ideas to boost a home&#8217;s resale value:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repair the driveway<b> $1,000-$5,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Spruce up the house number <b>$10-$100</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Invest in landscaping <b>$200-$2,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repaint the exterior<b> $5,000-$15,000</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remember: </b>In highly localized markets, like metropolitan cities, it’s important to make decisions in consultation with your real estate agent. What works in one neighborhood might not work in another. They will be the best person to guide you on where it makes sense to invest in a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep in mind you don’t need to spend a lot of money to upgrade your home. Weigh the financial and time costs, and consider whether you’d take a lower purchase price to save yourself the trouble. And remember, it’s not about recouping the exact value of the renovation in the sale price, but getting buyers to make offers in the first place!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How a passive house design can achieve top-notch energy efficiency</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32316 size-chrono" title="white-farmhouse-exterior" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-723x542.jpg" alt="white farmhouse exterior with blue sloping roof after renovation" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#8217;ve heard the term &#8220;passive home&#8221; to describe a home that needs almost no help from HVAC equipment to heat or cool itself. Its temperature and comfort are adjusted via passive rather than active mechanical systems. For example, it might have large south-facing windows next to a room with a floor of dark stones that absorb the sun&#8217;s heat and retain it for hours to produce warmth in the winter, and sophisticated shading to keep the stones, and the room, cool in the summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building or renovating using passive house principles can reduce energy costs by 80 to 90 percent when compared with standard buildings—saving the owners money, reducing the carbon footprint of the building, and making the house more comfortable. That&#8217;s good news!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path to reaching those savings calls for professionals with expertise in building techniques that are more exacting and often different from standard practices. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors and architects, offers an overview of achieving maximum home efficiency and comfort when it comes to construction.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Certified passive house techniques</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These projects start with designs that are geared to the local climate. Sophisticated computer models are used in an attempt to get energy use down near zero. Here are elements that are common to new construction and renovation projects:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super insulation</span>: Passive houses contain much more insulation than standard houses. Where a standard well-insulated house may have R-38 in the ceiling, passive houses routinely have R-49 to 80. Walls can have R-40 or higher. (The R-value refers to the ability of insulation to resist heat flow; the higher the number, the better the insulation.) To reach those levels in a brownstone while preserving the look of the exterior, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Isaac</a> says contractors must add new framing inside the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tight construction</span>: Buildings using this technique are extremely airtight, so there is very little infiltration of outside air or loss of inside air that has been heated or cooled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">High-performance windows and doors</span>: While double-glazed windows are the most common energy-efficient windows used in standard construction, triple-glazed windows with energy-efficient coatings are common here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ventilation systems</span>: Because the buildings are so airtight, mechanical ventilation is necessary to control moisture levels and maintain good air quality. The systems contain energy-recovery systems so that outgoing air can either heat or cool incoming fresh air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solar gain</span>: Windows are sized and oriented so that they can use the sun&#8217;s energy for heating in the winter. Roof overhangs help shade windows during the summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the outset, expect costs to be about 10 to 15 percent higher than standard renovation costs. Fortunately, the high-tech materials and techniques usually mean smaller heating and cooling units can be used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;But passive home is about more than just energy efficiency,&#8221; said Isaac. &#8220;When you step into a passive house, it is very quiet. If you are not getting air from outside, you are not getting much sound, either. And because the air is filtered, it is very clean. It ends up being a nice way to live.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Retrofitting your home</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most passive house designs are new construction, but renovations can retrofit an existing apartment or house. These types of remodels require a full-scale commitment to saving energy. Most are complete gut-to-the-exterior-walls projects to accommodate high insulation levels and other passive house techniques. EnerPhit is the certification program for retrofit renovations, and the requirements are less stringent than those for new construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kitchen-8-edit-RW.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32344 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kitchen-8-edit-RW-723x467.jpg" alt="passive house" width="723" height="467" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Townhouses and brownstones are good candidates,&#8221; said Sweeten contractor Isaac, who has been involved with passive renovations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. &#8220;They have these massive walls all around and there are usually other houses on either side, so there is already an advantage in controlling heating and cooling.&#8221; In addition, basements in a brownstone are so packed into the city infrastructure, little heat is lost into the ground. Focus on the roof and the short, exposed end walls of the house. Complete a home&#8217;s energy efficiency with triple-paned windows, a lot of insulation, and air sealing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For individual apartments within a larger building, “you can build an airtight envelope around your unit and make it separate from the outside and the rest of the building,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. “Pack in as much insulation as you can and wrap up the apartment all the way around.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may encounter problems with building regulations if you want to make changes to the outside of the building, such as installing high-performance windows that don’t match what is already there. The same applies to buildings with landmark status. Anthony says that in theory, custom covers to hide the window frames might be a solution. This would have to be worked out with the condo or co-op board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the standalone house, all four sides of the house, the attic, and the basement need to be considered. A building—high on insulation and low on air leakage—creates a strong building envelope. All windows should be swapped out. Outfit the attic and roof with a ton of insulation which works out if the roof needs to be replaced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost is high in the short term but many people consider it worth it. Some homeowners do deep energy retrofits to existing houses—a big step towards passive house—but hits the sweet spot financially. A substantial amount of money will be saved on heating and cooling costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A homeowner can use just about any passive house technique because EnerPhit is a performance standard that depends on how the house performs overall, not how individual components perform. “If you can make the envelope extremely airtight, you may be able to compensate if the windows are a problem,&#8221; explained Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>The story behind passive house</strong></p>
<p>While passive building is becoming more popular, it&#8217;s not entirely new. Its concepts were used as far back as the 1980s in the U.S. The ideas were refined and honed in Germany and other parts of Europe and the movement regained momentum here in the past 15 or so years.</p>
<p>A number of international, national, and local organizations have formed—there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.nypassivehouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Passive House</a> association and the <a href="https://www.phius.org/home-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passive House Institute US</a>, which conduct research, write standards, and certify architects, contractors, and other professionals. Third-party certification ensures the building will save the amount of energy predicted by the original design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When compared with the overall building and renovation industries, projects using passive house concepts make up a small percentage of the whole. But as more and more people become aware of the benefits, products and building techniques used will no doubt make their way into the standard construction practice in a bigger way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to retrofit your home to passive house standards, these Sweeten general contractors are passive house-certified and can get you on your way to living efficiently with lower costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">A primer on how to keep track of your home equity</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28744 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-12-723x482.jpg" alt="renovating home equity" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As homeowners, we sometimes find ourselves obsessed with how much our home is worth: “Our neighbor’s home sold for how much?”, or, on the flip side, “The property tax assessor thinks my house is worth how much?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Home improvements can really affect home value. Putting in a new kitchen in a hot market, for example, can really pay off in terms of making your home worth more. As homeowners, we take this into consideration when considering priorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the more important number that you want to pay attention to, instead of your residence&#8217;s, is really home equity. Whether you are curious about general appreciation or interested in getting a return on your home improvement investment, home equity is what you want to focus on. Let me explain.</p>
<p><strong>What is home equity?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Home equity is the amount of money in your home that’s yours, that you don’t owe to anyone else. An easy way to think about it is to think back to when you bought your home, how much of a down payment you put in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you paid $500,000 for your home and put $100,000 down (20%) and got a mortgage for the rest, that $100,000 is your home equity, while the rest is what you owe to the bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over time, you pay down your mortgage and build more and more equity in your home, owing less and less to the bank, making your home equity grow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your home equity also grows when your home appreciates and shrinks when your home depreciates. Here’s a simple diagram that shows the relationship between home value, home equity, and what you owe.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Home-Equity-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28761 mb-0 size-chrono" title="determining your home value" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Home-Equity-1-723x503.jpg" alt="renovating home equity" width="723" height="503" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why is home equity important?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Home equity is important because it determines how big a check you get when you sell your home. You’ll get a check for your home equity, minus fees related to the sale, such as real estate broker fees, etc. That’s pretty important!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of home equity is also important if you want to refinance, as you’ll want to maintain 20% equity in your home to be able to qualify for most refinances.</p>
<p><strong>Home equity changes as your home value changes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, let’s talk about what happens when the value of your home goes up. If your home value is $500,000 when you buy it, but in five years it’s worth $550,000, congratulations! You have $150,000 in home equity instead of just the $100,000 from your down payment. Your home equity can also shrink if home prices drop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An increase in home equity from a renovation is your return on investment.</p>
<p><strong>Home equity before and after renovations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s good to think about your home equity before you begin a renovation. If your home value goes up from a renovation, your home equity increases accordingly. An increase in home equity from a renovation is your return on investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a project costs you $10,000, and it raises your home value by $10,000, then your return on investment would be 100%. When it’s time to sell your property, you’ll get that $10,000 back (assuming the enhancement holds its value until the time you sell).</p>
<p><strong>Home equity loans and renovations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another reason to think about your home equity before and after a renovation is if you are taking out a home equity loan to pay for your renovation. Remember, home equity is the value of the home minus what you owe on it. If you owe more, then you have less home equity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take out a home equity loan; you just want to be aware of how it affects you. Remember, home equity is what you get back from a sale, and is often your profit. If your home equity dips below 20%, it can make it hard or impossible to refinance as we discussed above.</p>
<p><strong>An easy, 3-step way to know your home equity at any point in time</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, find your home’s current value. Do a search online for homes sold in the last six months and find three that are most like yours in terms of size, location, and interior condition. Use these to extrapolate a general home value based on current sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second, take a peek at your mortgage statement, either online or your printed statement, however you receive it. Look for the “remaining loan balance” or “remaining principal balance” field. Add to that amount any other outstanding loans you have on your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Third, take your home value and subtract what you owe. That’s your home equity.</p>
<p><strong>Home equity as major net worth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A U.S. Census report update from 2017 stated that homeowners have on average nearly 69% of their net worth in their home equity! Yet, it remains a mystery to most homeowners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By being aware of your home equity, you’ll better protect your net worth and have greater control and awareness of your financial opportunities related to homeownership, for both the short and long term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Keeping gas and plumbing in place? A contractor may be all you need</h2>
<p>Ever imagine what’d it be like to take your kitchen down to the studs and start over again? We’re not talking about knocking down walls or changing the placement of the sink or range—or anything that would mean moving plumbing or rerouting electricity. What we’re talking about is a clean swap. Out with the old—cabinets, countertop, backsplash, appliances—and in with the new. Perhaps you’re just looking for a simple upgrade for your kitchen (and by simple, we mean minimal changes to the structure, plumbing, or electrical). Or you’re dealing with budget or structural limitations that require an architect. Whatever your reasons for this kind of kitchen renovation, which typically takes between 1-2 months to complete, a general contractor may be all you need for a total refresh.</p>

</a><span class="img-label"> A <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/quick-download-greenpoint-kitchen-basks-newly-found-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a> in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dark, crowded kitchen in Greenpoint was in desperate need of some lightening and brightening. The original kitchen had wood cabinets with a dark finish and a matching black backsplash and countertop that consistently showed dirt. In order to give this kitchen the facelift it needed, all of the kitchen cabinets were removed and replaced with white, flat-front <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets</a> to provide a more modern look. Some of the upper cabinets were removed to make way for open shelving to give the space an overall lighter feeling. The old countertop got swapped for stone in a medium gray shade and the backsplash was replaced with veined marble tile. While the homeowner kept the original appliances, new cabinets, shelving, counters, and backsplash gave the kitchen the boost it needed for a bright new beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cybele_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26496 mb-10  size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation with semi-custom cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cybele_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-goes-low-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybele’s kitchen</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything in Cybele’s kitchen—old cabinets, coffee-colored backsplash, dark counters, and mismatched appliances—was ripped out, making the space an empty box ready for a fresh start. The old penny tile on the floor was removed, the subfloor was leveled, and then new flooring—faux wood porcelain tile—was installed. Walls were gutted to gain extra space for new counters and the old dark <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertop</a> was replaced with white quartz. New cabinets were installed, including taller upper cabinets with crown molding, and some of the lower cabinets were removed to make room for a dishwasher. Old backsplash tile was replaced with glossy teal subway tile and crisp white grout. The kitchen renovation thoroughly refreshed the space without any changes to the original floor plan, and new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appliances</a> included a compact microwave with a matching stainless steel shelf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26494 mb-10 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation with high-gloss cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="496" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lisa’s kitchen was tiny, just 54 square feet, its cabinets were too shallow to hold her servingware or pots and pans, and the drawers were too narrow. Nothing was as it should be, so the kitchen was gutted right down to the studs and subfloor. Semi-custom cabinets with a high-gloss finish and greater depth were installed, instantly improving the form and function of the space. The stained, laminate countertop was replaced with a bright, white quartz. White subway tile took the place of the old, cracked <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backsplash</a>, and a pinstripe of gray tile was added for a bit of flair. The existing appliances, which were beginning to short out and die, were substituted with a new dishwasher, counter-depth refrigerator, range, and microwave. The new look is clean and minimal—exactly what Lisa had in mind when she set out to upgrade her kitchen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Pre-fab cabinetry—like a pantry cabinet from IKEA—can be a simple way to fulfill the kitchen renovation ideas you’ve been dreaming about</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning your new kitchen design is an exciting time. It’s fun to walk through a big-box store like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a>, <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, or <a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and start brainstorming the look and feel of your space. These types of stores offer pretty much everything you need to build your kitchen, from cabinets and countertops to appliances, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucets</a>, sinks, and more. Even if you’re choosing to design and sketch out your own kitchen renovation ideas from scratch, it’s good to know what’s out there. Below are five examples of Sweeten kitchens that feature IKEA products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25466 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, pantry cabinet, countertop, sink, and oven range</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a contemporary design that would mesh well with the original molding and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in their new home, Jerry and Janet chose <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base cabinetry</a>—and a tall pantry cabinet—with molding from IKEA. To give them a modern edge, they had them painted in Balboa Mist and Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore. The gray tones were then incorporated into the design of their geometric backsplash tile and contrasted by a white countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25467 size-chrono" title="range, hood, cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25468 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Ursula</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, island, and hood</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ursula transformed a dark kitchen that lacked windows into a lighter and brighter space by incorporating white cabinets with a high-gloss finish. Since the kitchen didn’t offer much in the way of prep space, she implemented a few clever kitchen renovation ideas with an island from IKEA that resembles a dresser and went for a dusky shade of gray to add some contrast. Stainless steel appliances completed the look, including a super sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> that reflects the light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25469 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Fabio and Melina</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a narrow <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> that hadn’t been touched in 40 years, Fabio and Melina set out to design a whole new space that matched their personal tastes. They chose black cabinets to cement their strong point of view and included a few glass-fronted doors. A white countertop adds the perfect amount of contrast while a patterned floor tile helps tie the look together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25470 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Laura and Matthew</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, countertops, sink, faucet, and microwave</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Matthew realized that the original cabinets in their new home had been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painted</a> several times over and couldn’t be salvaged, so they purchased all new cabinets in a soft shade of gray. They also found a stainless steel microwave at IKEA that matched the look of their new range for a crisp, uniform appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25471 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregg and Kelly</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With two windows nestled in shadowy nooks and dark cabinets in the existing kitchen, Gregg and Kelly knew that they wanted it to feel as light and airy as possible. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knocking down walls</a> filled the space with natural light, and white, high-gloss cabinets with flat front doors brightened up the kitchen even more. Honed black granite countertops provide a pop of contrast against the white backdrop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These homes were stuck in the past until a (long overdue!) home renovation brought each one back to the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who are feeling ambitious and want to take on a home that hasn’t been changed in decades have a unique opportunity. In an older home that’s been given new life, updated features sit alongside quirky and charming details from the past, such as crown molding and arched doorways. This kind of home renovation where the marriage of old meets new provides all the benefits of a modern space while retaining the character that can only come from a place that has a history. Below, three Sweeten homeowners take on the challenge of revamping older homes—and the results are truly magical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25404 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25402 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Meredith’s townhouse</a>, built in 1941</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meredith set out to find a fixer-upper and fell in love with a two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington that only had one owner since 1941. With good bones and plenty of personality in the form of arched doorways and a 1950s Caloric stove, the home had potential, but it also required intensive repairs. Lead paint, cloth-wrapped aluminum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank">electrical wiring</a>, and old steel windows all had to go. Meredith found a contractor on Sweeten and started her renovation, focusing on maintaining some of the ‘40s charm while making necessary functional updates. A new kitchen was designed around the old stove, and in keeping with the theme of nostalgia, Meredith installed a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge and vintage enamel sink. The Pepto-Bismol pink bathrooms were redone in a much more tasteful palette of muted blues and received all new fixtures. Upstairs, the renovation included converting the second kitchen into a master bath, building a nursery, and updating the master bedroom and closet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of this lovely townhouse.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ron lived in his Upper East Side postwar apartment for 40 years before making the decision to renovate. He worked closely with his interior designer, who came to Sweeten to find a contractor to complete their team. The plan consisted of a total gut renovation of the kitchen as well as painting the apartment, stripping and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinishing floors</a>, cleaning up the crown molding in the living room, and adding custom millwork to hide old radiator units. He decided against joining the kitchen and living room and instead chose to keep the kitchen enclosed and add finishes that would make it feel larger and brighter. With all new appliances from Thermador, including a refrigerator<strong>, </strong>gas range, hood, and dishwasher, the kitchen got the functional upgrade it desperately needed. Architectural details in the kitchen mixed well with traditional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">custom cabinets</a> and beveled countertops for a refreshed yet classic style. In the living room, custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank">built-ins</a> with ample shelving were built to show off Ron’s collection of art and treasures from around the world. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of Ron’s home, including his updated bedroom and bath.</p>

</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after moving into her Upper East Side apartment, Claudia felt ready to renovate. It had been three decades since the apartment’s last home renovation, which had brought with it dated finishes, carpeting, and boxy built-ins. Claudia wanted to highlight the original bones of the home that had been covered up, reclaim some of the square footage lost to the old built-ins, and install some much-needed electrical outlets. She also ripped up the 30-year-old carpeting, uncovering original parquet floors. The windows in the living room were combined, allowing the space to become flooded with natural light, and the built-in surrounding the fireplace was demolished, revealing a wood-burning hearth. Crown molding was designed and placed along doorways, windows, ceilings, and floors to evoke some of the lost 1920s charm. To brighten up her home, the walls of the apartment were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white, replacing the dark green shade that had ruled the living room for decades. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see her updated kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Revamping a kitchen&#8217;s original floor plans can take your space from workable to wow!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a major kitchen transformation is your wish, going beyond swapping out kitchen cabinets or simply replacing existing features, you&#8217;ll want to enlist an architect to make changes to your floor plans.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Architects can see potential in the bleakest and most uninspiring places: Where we see darkness, they see spaces capable of being filled with natural light; where we see dead space and awkward cabinetry, they see new configurations and storage solutions. Whether you decide to work with an independent architect and a general contractor to execute your vision, or hire a design and build firm that can provide both architectural and construction services, chances are you won’t recognize your beautiful new kitchen once it’s done. Read on for five Sweeten kitchens that underwent an about-face in the best possible way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24795 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry and Janet’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Crown Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to find a fixer-upper that had a “bring your architect” vibe, Jerry and Janet came across a historic rowhouse that needed major work. After finding an architecture firm, as well as a general contractor, on Sweeten, they set their sights on updating the severely outdated home. New electrical, plumbing, and gas heating were installed throughout the rowhouse, followed by the framing of walls to create new floor plans. The kitchen was relocated to connect both the living and dining room, improving the flow of the home. Since the couple likes to cook, the space was laid out to allow ease of movement with plenty of counter space, and gray-toned IKEA cabinetry was installed to maximize storage space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24796 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A spacious one-bedroom with loads of potential led Joel and Eric to Sweeten to find a general contractor for their renovation. One of their contractor’s references turned out to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners and designers Casey and Kumar</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who were brought on board to design the new space. The 1920’s-era apartment had a sunken living room, high ceilings, and lots of ornamental details—as well as a kitchen that was too small and dark. Updates to the floor plans were necessary, starting with a plan to connect the living room to the kitchen. Casey came up with the idea for a unified countertop, a piece that would serve as a bridge between the two rooms with a wraparound counter and plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> underneath. The peninsula allowed the kitchen to feel much more open and inviting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24797 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="1085" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris’ kitchen</a> in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lia and Chris came to Sweeten to make over their two-bedroom, top floor unit with high ceilings, tons of light, and spectacular views. They chose to work with a design and build firm to address the outdated, open plan kitchen that looked out to the living room. The result provided more counter and storage space, filled in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hid the fridge</a> for a more streamlined look. By far the most exciting part of the design included opening up the ceiling and exposing building beams in the living room for an industrial look, with the last exposed beam acting as a visual separation between the two spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20833 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s kitchen</a> on the Upper West Side, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natural light was not an issue in Sophia and Leon’s three-bedroom apartment—they had three exposures during the day that received a ton of light, but none of it ever made it into the kitchen due to its “bento box” layout. Working with a design and build firm that they found through Sweeten, they took down unnecessary walls that completely cut off the kitchen. The new floor plans included a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-built</a>, open kitchen between the living room and dining room, allowing light to flow through the entire apartment. Open shelving on one side of the kitchen helped transition the space into the living area with storage for books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="483" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p>Not wanting a cookie-cutter apartment, architect Tina was drawn to a two-bedroom garden duplex with high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room, a space that she was excited to customize for her family. With the couple’s first child on the way, any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work were eliminated in order to cut down on both the permit approval and construction timelines. Tina completed her architectural drawings before meeting with contractors and decided to work with a Sweeten contractor who proposed an ambitious six-week timeline. Her main goal: to create an open kitchen by removing a floating, non-structural wall that had separated the space from the living room. New cabinets were continued around a corner, transforming the space from a narrow galley into an L-shape complete with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom kitchen island</a>. Semi-custom cabinets were designed around the existing appliances and maximized storage vertically.</p>

<p>Working with an existing galley kitchen layout has its challenges, but there are also many benefits that you can take advantage of with smart planning.

<h3>Moving forward with top contractor choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Sweeten, we know a lot about general contractors. One frequent question from homeowners involves how to prepare for a general contractor meeting. Site visits assess if a pro will be a good fit and to also secure the most precise estimate possible for the project.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">We recommend:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">reviewing three expert profiles that Sweeten matches you with</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">having at least three phone calls and site visits with the matches</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">requesting three estimates so you can make an informed decision</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A phone call to discuss the project before the site visit may save you valuable time. It&#8217;s a good first introduction and gauges whether you&#8217;re both on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—</span>for free.</p>
<h4>Why it&#8217;s important to meet general contractors on-site</h4>
<p>Site visits are one of the first steps in a renovation. The meeting lasts 60–90 minutes on average and gives you a chance to interview experts who will help you get the job done. More importantly, it checks whether there&#8217;s chemistry and good communication between you and the contractor.</p>
<p>While Sweeten simplifies the search by matching vetted and licensed professionals to your project, you&#8217;ll still want to make an informed decision by having an in-person meeting. The visits should be with one contractor at a time. As you begin to schedule visits and solicit bids, here are a few ways you can prepare for a successful meeting with potential general contractors. Click here for more on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-align: justify;">how to work with a contractor</a><span style="text-align: justify;">.</span></div>

</div>
</div>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Preparing the details for a remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">To prepare for your site visit, keep the following on hand for easy reference: </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Anticipated start date</span></span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>:</strong> Include information about any flexibility, as well as variables that might affect/change the date.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Renovation goals</span></span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>:</strong> Be prepared to discuss your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves&#8221;</a> items. You may request that bids include ways to remove items from the latter category if the budget is going over. Be specific about how you plan to use the new space, and how the old space falls short. If you need more storage, be specific about what you want to store there. Sharing this information with your contractor will help them create tailored solutions for you. If you are unsure of your end goals, let the contractor know. This will establish that you are looking for guidance, and the contractor can advise accordingly or suggest a designer or other expert to work in tandem with you.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Budget</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Reiterate your budget so that the contractor can keep it in mind while discussing options. For example, this will affect whether they suggest custom or stock cabinets. You can also specify a labor versus material budget. If you plan to apply for a loan to finance your project, mention this upfront since it’ll add time to your project. At the end of your meeting, ask when you can expect an estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Inspiration photos</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: One of the best ways for a contractor to get a sense of your vision is to provide a Pinterest page, photos on your phone, or magazine tearsheets.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Plans and sketches</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you have these, provide them. Even if it’s a rough sketch you did by hand on scrap paper, it can help the contractor understand your vision. If you did them in SketchUp or had an architect draw renderings already, have them ready.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Division of labor</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Who will do what? If you plan to source the materials yourself, make that clear so that the expert does not include those estimates in the bid. Should you need a designer, an expediter, a project manager, or custom millwork, discuss who will be responsible for securing those services and whether they will be included. If you don’t yet know, make a point to discuss these options with the contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>House rules and alteration agreement</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you live in a condo or a co-op building, ask your management company for these documents. Review them with or prior to meeting the contractor. Restrictions on working hours and building requirements can often affect the budget. Some co-op boards will not work with specific insurance carriers so <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check with your board</a>. Share this with the contractor prior to the site visit. You want to be sure that your top contractor choices can work in your building. </span></p>
<h3>How to prepare for a general contractor meeting</h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Questions for a general contractor</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that many factors go into a smooth working relationship. Understanding as much as you can about the contractor’s experience, and how they work, is crucial. Try to have</span><span class="s1"> all decision makers present during the site visit. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page. </span><span class="s1">The following are examples of questions to ask: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often will they be on-site? </span><span class="s2">Who will oversee the work on a daily basis?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the contractor take clients shopping for materials or provide shopping resources?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often do they meet with clients to discuss the project&#8217;s progress?<br />
</span></li>
<li>Will the contractor send progress reports via email or by phone, and how often? If you have a preference, let them know this.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How do they approach problems during an emergency? If a pipe should burst, what is the protocol?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">What is the best way to reach them?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for an estimate. The length of time to receive it depends on the size of the scope. Ask them what the ETA is for the estimate. An estimate for a one-room project that&#8217;s straightforward should take one week, while a gut renovation of a townhouse may take a month.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for references or read contractors&#8217; reviews on our site. For bigger projects, a contractor may take you on a walk-through of a project they completed for a past client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other topics to bring up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss with the contractor if you and your family plan on living/working in the space during the renovation. What will this arrangement look like?</li>
<li>Share any important dates that affect the completion date, such as family coming to visit. Will the project be completed by then? If not, what is the plan?</li>
<li>Inquire how the contractor&#8217;s company is set up. Do they have more than one project happening at once?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Communication is key</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like all great matches, there is a lot that can’t be determined on paper. Face-to-face meetings are not only an opportunity for the contractors to get a sense of the scope of your project and the actual site conditions but also for you to get to know them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two of you will be working closely together for the duration of the project. It’s important that you feel the contractor understands where you are coming from and the vision you want to execute. Having a contractor who&#8217;s had similar experiences in handling the scope you are presenting is more important than whether they&#8217;ve done work in your neighborhood. How to prepare for a general contractor meeting also includes listening to your “gut feeling.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your site visit is a chance to interview an individual who will become a key part of your life for the next few weeks to months. You will rely on them to make decisions when you’re not available, but also to know when a discussion is necessary before taking action. So consider these questions as you’re getting to know the contractor during the site visit:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does this person communicate clearly and effectively?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do they have a clear understanding of what I need, and can they provide it?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do I feel supported in my decision-making?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does it seem like the contractor will be responsive and organized throughout the process?</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Schedule a bid-leveling call</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After the walk-through, take the time to sit down and debrief. If you go over the full scope of the work and ask for the contractor&#8217;s feedback on your ideas, this will create a firm foundation for working together.</span></p>
<p>When all estimates are in hand, schedule a one-on-one <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling call</a> with Sweeten to help compare them. Estimates are not universal and can differ in terminology, organization, and basic assumptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A licensed GC brings protection and accountability to your project</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47784 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>You’ve spent months, even years, dreaming up your home renovation. You’ll want to hire a licensed*, experienced, and professional general contractor to execute the remodel. Make note that the term &#8220;licensed&#8221; can also be referred to as registered or certified.</p>
<p>*An important note: <em>Sweeten contractors are fully licensed in states that have licensing laws. Some states in the United States such as Texas does not license contractors.</em></p>
<p>Renovations can stretch budgets, making it tempting to go with a lower quote from someone who is unlicensed. However, in the long run, this can cost you more—in some cases, a LOT more—if anything goes wrong or the work isn’t up to par. Renovation matchmaker <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> vets all the contractors in its network, and checks in on the project until it’s completed. Cities, states, and towns have varying degrees of requirements for a licensed contractor, but chances are, if you&#8217;re hiring a licensed general contractor he or she will likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be required to have insurance</li>
<li>Be required to be bonded</li>
<li>Have gone through a criminal background check</li>
<li>Have taken and passed a contractors’ exam</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s why every home remodel should be done by a licensed building professional:</p>
<h3>When do you need to hire a licensed general contractor?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Projects in New York City that require a license include basement conversions, demolitions, bathroom or kitchen remodels, and wall additions. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/master-electricians.page"><span class="s2">Specialty skills</span></a> such as an electrician or plumber must have their own license that is specific to their trade even if they are operating as a subcontractor.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In California, a licensed general contractor is a must for any project above $500. Electrical and plumbing trades must also be licensed for jobs over $500 and are required to take a different exam from a general contractor (more on that below).</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Check your local building department</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The maximum value of a project that can be completed without a license varies from state to state and county to county. It is wise to check with your state and local building department for what project type and size calls for a licensed contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New York City, projects under $200 can be done by someone without a license. Jobs under $500 in California, such as painting can also be completed by someone without a license.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you live in the suburbs or city in most areas of the country, it is very likely that all but the smallest home improvement projects, like swapping out a faucet or painting room, will require a licensed general contractor. </span><span class="s1">Anyone taking on a project over your area’s minimum without a contractor&#8217;s license is doing so illegally. Besides breaking the law, there is no accountability if an issue should arise (more about that below).</span></p>
<h3>You want a contractor who has insurance for your protection</h3>
<p>Your home insurance might cover a few things, but when something goes wrong with a renovation, an average policy won’t cover everything. For example, if a bathtub is installed incorrectly and causes water damage to your floor, your home insurance might cover the water damage. However, it won’t help you when it comes to fixing that shoddy installation job.</p>
<p>With people working in your home, you are something of a pseudo employer. If any workers are injured while on the job in your residence, you could be vulnerable to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Those reasons are why licensed general contractors are required to carry two types of insurance:</p>
<ul>
<li>General liability insurance: This covers the contractor against any third-party lawsuits involving injury to a person or damage to property. For instance, if your contractor reverses into your neighbor&#8217;s car, the cost of damage is covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your state, city, or county will dictate a minimum for general liability insurance. In New York City, it is $1 million. If you are remodeling an apartment, your co-op or condo board could request over and above the level required to get a licensed professional in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker’s compensation: This covers any medical costs associated with a workplace injury for anyone working in your home. It also covers lost wages due to a work-related injury.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do contractors need to have insurance in all states or counties? Although uncommon, <a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/blog/general-contractor-license-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not every region</a> requires a general contractor to have all types of insurance. For example, <a href="https://generalcontractorlicenseguide.com/nebraska-contractors-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebraska</a> only requires GCs to carry worker’s compensation and not general liability insurance. Just to be safe, it is best to check what your state requires as well as the requirements in your local city or county.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A bonded contractor offers another safeguard</h3>
<p>Many jurisdictions require licensed contractors to contribute to bonding, which offers financial help to clients often when insurance doesn’t. Bonding is a pot of money that pays out clients if a general contractor fails to complete a job, doesn’t do the job properly, or damages a home due to negligence.</p>
<p>Bonding is required basically <a href="https://www.markupandprofit.com/articles/state-by-state-guide-to-general-contractor-bond-amounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everywhere</a>. If your state doesn’t require it, then your local area will. To get a license in New York City, contractors are required to pay $200 into a trust fund with the Department of Consumer Affairs or prove they have a surety bond through a third party. In California, a bond is always done through a third party licensed by the state.  Similar to insurance, the contractor pays a fraction of the bond amount required to a third party, who agrees to pay out the full bond amount if it is needed.</p>
<p>In other states, <a href="https://www.bryantsuretybonds.com/contractor-license-bond/illinois" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like Illinois</a>, there are different bond amounts for different types of work. For example, plumbing contractors must have a $20,000 bond, whereas roofing contractors only need $10,000. Again, as with California, the contractor pays a fraction of this amount to a third party. General contractors in<a href="https://www.suretybonds.org/contractor-license-bonds/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Florida </a>only need to be bonded if their FICO credit score is below 660.</p>
<h3>Most areas conduct a criminal background check</h3>
<p>Most areas will put applicants through a criminal background check. However, a criminal record won’t automatically disqualify someone from getting their license. It’s likely the licensing department will assess each applicant individually, weighing factors such as the severity of the crime, if it is related to an individual being able to carry out the functions of a contractor, and evidence that indicates rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>Passing a contractor’s exam</h3>
<p>It is common to sit for an exam before a license is issued. How difficult that test is and what questions are asked can vary greatly from area to area. In New York City, 21 out of 30 questions must be answered correctly to pass the exam and be taken by a sole proprietor or general partner owning 10% or more of the company. The questions focus primarily on the knowledge of the city’s regulations and best practices. Examples are “Must a contractor furnish a consumer with a written estimate?” and “What are the penalties for false or fraudulent representation?”</p>
<p>California requires two tests. One is a more general law and business examination that all building professionals must take. In 2018, more than 51,000 exams were scheduled, according to California’s Contractors State License Board. The other is more specific to a contractor’s line of work: general engineering contractor, general building contractor, or specialty contractor. The second test takes more than three hours and contains technical questions such as “According to the California Residential Code, what is the minimum allowable width of a residential hallway?”</p>
<h3>How to check a general contractor’s license</h3>
<p>Always request and check for an HIC number. Many areas make this easily accessible and the information is often through a city or county’s consumer affairs department. For New York City, there is an online search tool where you can check whether a contractor’s license is legitimate and current (a license in the Big Apple lasts for <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/general-contractor-registration.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three years</a>). <span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, where licenses are renewed every two years, there is</span> a similar <a href="https://www2.cslb.ca.gov/onlineservices/CheckLicenseII/checklicense.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online tool</a>.</p>
<p>The United States is a patchwork of state, city and county regulations with licensing requirements differing from place to place but the process your licensed contractor will likely have had to undergo will be similar. In some cases, such as with California, licensing is handled at the state level. In other states, such as New York, licensing is mostly handled by counties. But in some cities, like New York City, it is handled at a city level.</p>
<p>Sweeten thoroughly vets its network of contractors including interviewing past clients, reviewing past renovations, and assessing the quality of the work. Start the path to your dream home with the right construction team and be a step closer to your dream home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Editor’s Note: This post, originally published on October 30, 2016, is all about giving your neighbors a heads up on your home renovation timeline. </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Letting your neighbors know that there will soon be construction happening in your apartment is a considerate thing to do. Especially if complications arise—like during <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/movie-set-comes-life-studio-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy&#8217;s renovation</a> when 60-year-old pipes burst onto her downstairs neighbors, who were thankfully very understanding—you&#8217;ll want your neighbors to be aware that construction is happening nearby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Advance notice is also helpful if your neighbors work from home or have small children and need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plan</a> around your construction schedule, particularly when noisy work is going to happen. Plus, your neighbors are likely to be curious. Many people asked <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris and Amber</a> about their renovation, so letting people in your building know about your plans beforehand will help cut back on questions. Being considerate of how the construction will affect your neighbors is vital in maintaining a good relationship with the people who live next door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many ways to approach this often overlooked step in home renovation etiquette, depending on the tone or terms of acquaintance you already have with those in your building. Here’s a letter I sent to my building’s upstairs, downstairs, and same-floor neighbors before <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-doing the floors</a> in my <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation/decluttering-home-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small East Village apartment</a> with a few thoughts on why it worked to preserve peace in my little corner of the building:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11934" title="Notifying Neighbors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kerry-letter-to-neighbors-B.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="596" height="664" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kerry-letter-to-neighbors-B.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kerry-letter-to-neighbors-B-269x300.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /><br />
My letter is a good bit longer and more conversational than it may need to be. It’s possible that I was overeager, but I was genuinely concerned about how my neighbors might be affected by the noise and the presence of workers. I had met some of my neighbors in passing, but others were total strangers, so I took a formal, professional approach to outlining the dates of the work and assuring residents that I had chosen a reputable contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I went further and wrote about the specifics of my project, why I was doing the work, acknowledged that there might be some unknowns on timing, and issued a friendly open invitation to future neighborly get-togethers. In short, I knew that the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/8-ways-minimize-mess-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noise and dust</a> might be a headache for next door neighbors and I tried to demonstrate that I had gone out of my way to be considerate about the plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A three-day flooring project is not the worst thing that can happen in the apartment next to you, but I found that neighbors were generally understanding and reasonable about the disruption, and enjoyed swinging by after the work was done to see the new floors and say hello.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re planning your own home renovation, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project on Sweeten</a> and feel free to use my letter as a starting point to keep your neighbors in the know!</p>
