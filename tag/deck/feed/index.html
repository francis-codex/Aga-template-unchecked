<h3></h3>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">A country vibe in the Westchester County suburbs</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">“This unbelievable property felt like it was in the country, rather than the suburbs,” Shana Sandberg of <a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revel Craft and Design</a> said. The 1953 estate, comprising of 1.3 acres in Westchester County&#8217;s Harrison, NY, had a pastoral feel. When the current owners purchased the derelict foreclosure, the house was 5,900 square feet of interior space with seven bedrooms. But the home’s interior had no large meeting space—not a great room nor a dining hall. The existing hang-out spots were a small living room, a cramped kitchen, and a basement den.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The house’s owners, part of a large extended family that had long enjoyed summers together, had grown out of their previous five-bedroom home. Wanting to turn this new, bigger house into their happy place, they hired the Revel team. Shana’s firm found the property and helped guide the family through its purchase. The next challenge was to create and carry out their transformational Westchester County home remodel.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Gathering spots for the family</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">At the top of the To-Do list was to make a place, or places, for the </span><span class="s10">family to gather.</span><span class="s9"> Shana posted the renovation on Sweeten and assisted the homeowners in hiring a contractor who would help bring her vision for the home and property to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, Shana recalled, the existing dining room couldn’t accommodate her clients’ dining table. The kitchen was so poorly designed, it cut off the first floor’s flow. Finishes throughout the home were dated or in bad shape. The property’s outside spaces also had issues. “The outdoor space felt cut off from the land around it,” Shana said. She set out to transform this old home into the ultimate multi-generation compound. The house would have its very first whole-family gathering room along with an inviting chain of indoor and outdoor places and spaces.</span><b></b></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;">An addition with an outside view</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s9">The property’s overhaul was truly a vision in motion. The new house was a dream with its seven sleeping rooms, each of which needed only light renovation, but its kitchen and bathrooms needed total redos. Creating common rooms would require additional square footage. “It was clear where a new family room would go,” Shana said, and how a 750-square-foot addition could make the house function better. She also wanted to enhance the owners’ connection with the property and natural surroundings. “It was easy to see,” Shana added, “decks and pools as the new gathering spaces.”</span><b></b></span></p>
<p><span class="s9" style="color: #000000;">The vision for all areas was to engage with the outdoors. “The addition was planned so it did not disturb a huge, gorgeous oak tree,” Shana explained; the family room extension pushes into the backyard, and windows on three sides provide 180-degree views. The plan also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added a screened-in porch and a deck</a>.</span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">A facelift for the house’s interior</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, the remodel changes were just as transformational. Terracotta tile floors were replaced with smooth, warm white-oak flooring. Carrara-looking porcelain tile was chosen to bring a timeless feel to the family’s bathrooms. “For the main-floor powder bathroom,” Shana said, “we’ve had some fun with a surprise moment of a wallcovering called Sumatra.”</span><b></b></p>

<p><span class="s9">Throughout the home, Shana put an emphasis on functionality and took every opportunity to incorporate storage. “We actually made the kitchen and an adjacent bathroom smaller,” she said, revising the layouts and carving out hidden storage, including a pantry, hall closet, and much-needed laundry room cabinetry. “In the new family room, we integrated a built-in bench to hide toys and blankets.”</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">Shana had eyes on everything down to the little details, playing many roles over the course of this renovation. “We were excited to wear most of the hats in this project, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from planning to architecture, to interiors</a> and landscape,” she said. The renovation touched more than 8,000 square feet. The final square footage totaled 8,176 square feet of interior space and 3,000 exterior square feet. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Revel completed it in a year.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Making the most of a rocky situation</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">For the main exterior space, the goal of communing with nature was similar. “We designed cascading decks,” Shana explained, describing &#8220;hoppable&#8221; platforms that are large, inviting steps into the landscape. Minimal steel cable railings guided walkers downward.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The project was complicated, and the team geared up for unexpected issues. “We hit a doozy when we found that the property is mostly built on ledge or rock. The grade was too high, causing termite issues and more,” Shana said. Much of the property required regrading and excavation for the pool involved weeks of chipping. “We were prepared for it budget-wise, but it delayed us,” she said.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">An outdoor family playground finally emerges</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Shana extended a stone retaining wall by nearly 40 feet in making a surround for the new pool, and created a planting bed between the pool and the wall. “Now, from the decks as well as the family room, you look onto a wildflower garden that surprises with new blooms throughout spring, summer, and fall,” she explained. Instead of putting a traditional fence around the pool, the Revel team designed a bucolic log enclosure including almost transparent safety mesh. </span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">Teamwork in action</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">From beginning to end, Shana “drove the concept of creating this feeling of being out in the country</span><span class="s9">, with a palette and layout for both the interior and exteriors.” The Sweeten contractor, she said, was paramount to the project’s success. “The contractors truly felt like our partners,” she said, citing strong daily communication and accounting transparency. “They put us first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Sweeten supported the process. “They checked in during the project to make sure we were getting what we needed from our contractors, and on how the project was coming along,” Shana said.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The end result? An easy-access forever family home that feels far from the fray. And construction challenges that have completely faded into the woodwork thanks to good partner in her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a>. “Renovation combined with new construction is a game of planning, patience, and pivoting,” Shana says. “So much can and will go wrong. Knowing how to pivot can turn a bad circumstance into a great solution.” This family haven is living, breathing proof of it.</span></p>

<h3>Planning out the backyard space</h3>
<p>K.V. received suggestions from friends, including calls for a pool, but found herself inspired by the gardens of Mexico and Brazil. She preferred lush retreats and welcoming <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor decks</a> for relaxation and fun. Hosting friends and barbecues was top of mind.</p>

<p>Her vision for cedar fencing became the focal point of the project. The Brooklyn <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard renovation</a> was framed by horizontal cedar boards with areas to lounge and dine. The red perimeter incorporated natural clean lines.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor started by clearing the yard entirely. They pulled up everything until they reached fresh dirt, making way for a clean slate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="backyard-with-stained-cedar-fencing" class="alignnone wp-image-50617 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg" alt="Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />After clearing and leveling the plot, he installed stained cedar fencing around the full yard. A lone mature tree in the far right corner of the yard was preserved. Her contractor discovered bluestone under the rubbish during demolition. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No two renovations</a> are the same. As a result, he suggested upcycling them as part of a pathway leading to an elevated oasis at the back filled with gravel. Post your project on Sweeten to see what creative backyard ideas you and your contractor can <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan together</a>. Here are some <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard renovation costs</a> to take into consideration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50622 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated backyard with cedar walls, gravel floor and hammock area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Discovering the green thumb</h3>
<p>Although they used fresh sod sparingly, the yard’s midsection revealed a green, lush aesthetic. K.V. admitted that having grass was a lot of work. As a consequence, however, she acquired a green thumb, a better sense of gardening, and plans for increased plantings next year. A row of mulch ran along the left side of the fencing with annuals, perennials, and blooms. It made a great foundation for her newly acquired landscaping skills.</p>

The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/backyard-deck-goes-wall-to-wall-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated deck</a> included bright Acapulco chairs, a fire pit, and a hammock (which she considered tossing until she made peace with the fact that she spent most of her days relaxing here). A grill and dining area sit along the walkway.</p>
<p>With a completed backyard renovation in Brooklyn under her belt, K.V. is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready for outdoor living</a> in the city.</p>

Outdoor space can range from a small patio to an outdoor kitchen. Some costs to consider include flooring; bluestone is popular but slightly pricey at $8/square foot. It’s heavy as well and requires a crane. Concrete pavers cost $4-5/square feet. Both have the same labor costs. Demolition costs will be determined by the existing conditions: What is the access? Is there grass? Other costs can include fencing or lighting that may involve running buried electrical lines or removing overhead lines.</p></div>

<h3 class="p1">Overhaul an overgrown urban garden</h3>
<p class="p3">Two years ago, we bought this 2,000-square-foot townhome, located between the Crown Heights and Prospect Lefferts neighborhoods. The attached single-family house was built in 1908, and we’ve been slowly working on updating it. Last year, with the pandemic grounding us at home, we got to work renovating our backyard.</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard</a> was a blank canvas. The previous owners had laid concrete slabs on the ground in the area closest to the house, but the space was otherwise covered in grass. We allowed it to grow wild our first summer here. The brush got so high that our dog, Sasha, would walk out and disappear. <span class="s1">We wanted to turn our barren backyard into a place that we—my husband, Henry, our son, Gavin, and myself—could enjoy.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1">Solving the rain problem</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henry and I knew we wanted a deck with built-in seating, and we loved the modern look of horizontal fencing. </span>We liked <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluestone pavers</a> and wanted to incorporate it. But our first concern was to identify and solve some engineering problems. We’d had a water issue in our fence-enclosed backyard since we bought the place—flooding whenever it rained. We needed a contractor who could fix that.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Seeking the right expertise</h3>
<p class="p3">The process of finding our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor was streamlined and direct. We posted our project and soon received a bid from a small firm we thought we wanted to hire. We threw out many concerns as well as ideas when we discussed the job with the contractor, and when <span class="s2">we saw his great sketches incorporating everything</span>, we knew he was the one we were searching for.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Designing an outdoor living room</h3>
<p class="p6">Once we had what we needed, the team began the work of reengineering the drainage system on our property. This made for a lot of holes in the ground, but they knew what they were doing and they ultimately solved the water problem. To create the deck, they drilled down in a series of spots, so large deck beams could be sunk into the earth. They then created a structural platform connecting the beams, which became the deck foundation.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3">Our Sweeten contractor and his team were wonderful from beginning to end. </span>We’d decided on the raised deck to break up the flow of the backyard. We agreed there should be a clear delineation between the ground and the spot where you &#8220;step&#8221; up onto the deck, like an outdoor living room. Whenever they had an idea, they would either lay it out or draw it for us. <span class="s3">The result was a truly collaborative design that perfectly reflected our aesthetic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">Customizing a Brooklyn deck renovation</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">Long boards were framed horizontally to create the high vertical walls. </span>The contractor came up with the idea of spacing between the boards, and we loved it.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">Atop the foundation they’d made, the contractors built <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/building-your-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the large platform deck</a>. Benches and planters were built around the perimeter. </span>They customized everything. The contractor had Henry and me sit on a &#8220;mock&#8221; bench and rest our arms with drinks to determine what height to build the side tables. The bench seat slides out to reveal built-in storage for pillows and gardening tools.</p>
<p class="p7">We picked a wood stain in a color we love—it gives the wood a mixture of brightness and warmth we were looking for. A small but impactful detail was that the design team chose nails in a similar color so it blended with the wood. I didn&#8217;t even realize that nails came in different colors.<span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">We chose square, untextured slabs of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluestone pavers</a> to surface the area between the house and the step-up onto the deck. The backdrop is the beautiful old brick of the building behind us!</p>

<h3 class="p3">Loving our Sweeten construction crew</h3>
<p class="p3">The project manager and crew were great. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a Sweeten contractor </a>who stayed in constant contact, giving us progress updates. <span class="s5">He was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledgeable, detail-oriented</a>, and efficient, and he was also great with kids. </span>He informed us of any challenges we were running into ahead of time, so that Henry and I were mentally prepared. This helped us to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make informed decisions</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Our Sweeten contractor shared everything from design and decor ideas to recipes and movie recommendations. The crew brought such great energy to our backyard that we missed them when work was complete.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Feeling beyond satisfied</h3>
<p class="p3">Now that our backyard is finished, we love everything about it. Having a private spot of green in the city feels like an absolute must. Our backyard is a sanctuary where we can relax, eat, drink, enjoy nature, <span class="s1">and </span><span class="s5">feel at ease.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><i>Thank you, Jess and Henry, for sharing your inspiring Brooklyn deck renovation with us!</i></p>

<h3>A homecoming for Americans abroad</h3>
<p class="p2">Before the word “Covid” entered our collective consciousness, Andrew and I lived as American expats in Hong Kong. As educators, we worked long and active terms, which were often fulfilling, but sometimes thankless. We cherished our long breaks.</p>
<p class="p2">In our first few years together, we traveled all over Asia and Europe. However, we knew at some point we would settle back home in California, close to family, both given and chosen.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50465 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05.jpeg" alt="Image of LA homeowners who used Sweeten" width="1536" height="1152" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05.jpeg 1536w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05-600x450.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><span class="img-label"><em>(</em></span><span class="img-label"><em>Above)</em> Family portrait courtesy of Sweeten homeowners</span></span></p>
<h3>Purchasing the right-size bungalow home</h3>
<p class="p2">2018 was our year. After I returned from a visiting professor role in the South of France, Andrew and I married in the south of California. Right after we said “I do,” we started looking for a home, for living in when we visited Los Angeles, and for renting out the rest of the year. Our goal was to find a modest, move-in-ready house in a central location, with a spectacular view.</p>

<p>We soon discovered, though, that the supply in the market meeting both our needs and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a> was greatly limited. Eventually, we chose the hillside of Glassell Park. Our 650-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bathroom bungalow was still nearly double the size of our apartment in Hong Kong. It was more space than we&#8217;d had in a long time, and we knew that it would be the perfect place to welcome us back to this side of the Pacific. Best of all, our southwest-facing view meant we could watch the sun rise and set without moving from our perch.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Working from home during Covid</h3>
<p class="p1">Then Covid happened. In the summer of 2020, we left Hong Kong, our cat Velcro in tow. Moving during a pandemic was not easy, but a larger space and the LA weather made <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working from home</a> more manageable. We decided to enjoy actually living in our home before renovating. When the time was right, we started with the bathroom, and then added something special for our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor space</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">The total renovation time, from when our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor began demolition to painting, took about six weeks. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small bathroom</a> was the biggest challenge. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wanted a space</a> that was updated, but timeless. Which meant everything had to go!</p>
<h3>Inspired by a classic bright blue</h3>
<p class="p1">We’re not afraid of color but prefer to inject it as an accent. I chose black-and-white as the base with 3” x 6” white subway tile. (It reminded us of our years in New York). To add some whimsy, we decided to mix geometric shapes—herringbone in the shower and a brick layout for the rest of the bathroom. <span style="color: #333333;">The tile installer ended up laying the herringbone horizontally instead of the classic vertical configuration, but this added to the quirkiness we had envisioned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05.jpg" alt="Yves Klein blue bathroom remodel in los angeles" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50458" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovators-converted-tubs-to-showers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub was removed and replaced</a> with a freestanding shower. Andrew is 6’3”, and was thrilled when he discovered the ceiling could be moved up by a foot, allowing the showerhead to be mounted several inches above his red curls. For the shower floor, I chose a simple porcelain penny tile, trying to match one of my favorite hues: Yves Klein blue. To tie this rich color back to the rest of the bathroom, we painted the walls with custom-matched semi-gloss paint.</p>
<h3>Making a small space feel open</h3>
<p class="p1">I sourced all of the bathroom components myself. The pre-fabricated glass shower door plays with the geometric theme using varying sizes of rectangles. Its frosted glass helps to diffuse the light while providing a modest cover. I carried this into the blocky console sink with exposed legs. Above it, the round vanity mirror with a medicine cabinet ties back to the round penny tiles. Due to the small size of the bathroom, it was important to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open it up</a> as much as possible. So we avoided closed cabinets. This also forced us to be more mindful of our clutter.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03.jpg" alt="white herringbone tile with black grout in blue bathroom remodel in los angeles" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50456" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">For the most part, I was conscious of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not over-spending</a> on the decorative components. We did splurge with the pieces for the sink and shower. And with the pièce de résistance: a Japanese-style toilet and bidet with seat warmer, air dryer, and warm water setting. Andrew doubted the necessity of this but now can’t imagine life without it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The tile installer ended up laying the herringbone horizontally instead of the classic vertical configuration, but it only added to the quirkiness we had envisioned.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The finishing touch was the porcelain basketweave floor tiles in black and white. I thought this would be a nice way to ground the complexity of the rigid and organic shapes with one last element.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50461 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated deck entrance from living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p1">Bringing the deck inside</h3>
<p class="p1">When we’re home, we find the most joy <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching the sunset from our deck</a> that looks over the neighborhood. Our goal was to bring that view into the home itself, so we decided to replace the two living room windows with a set of pre-hung French doors. The best feature of the doors is that the blinds are set between two panes of glass, making it ideal for thwarting a mischievous, climbing cat. Velcro loves to play! Now all three of us can lie on our rugs and pillows on the floor, watching the sunbeams stream into our home. We even got a retractable screen door so that Velcro, too, can enjoy the fresh air from inside.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re very happy with <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the progress we’ve made</a> on the home so far. It <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feels more like ours</a> every day! That being said, we’re still not done. Next project: <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen redo</a>! As a home chef, this is my most sacred space. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Cory and Andrew, for sharing your hillside home with us!</em></p>

<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stone-counter-granite-countertop" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg" alt="stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4277#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

<h3>Choosing between a house or apartment</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My husband and I used to live in Manhattan in a one-bedroom apartment. Once we decided to have children, we knew we wanted to live closer to our families. So we opted to buy a house in the Bronx and have our parents partake in child-raising. Originally we thought we would have one child, live in the area for a few years, and then move back to Manhattan once school started. </span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Our house addition plan: Envisioning more space</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we soon fell in love with having a house and wanted to have more kids. Our neighborhood is quite ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. It feels like a nice mix, like we’re away from the city, but not quite in the suburbs. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wanted more living space on the first floor because it’s where we spend most of our time as a family. We also wanted our children, who are 9, 6, and 3, to have larger bedrooms and decided to add a 250-square-foot attic dormer for that purpose. The idea was for the new space to be airy and maximize the view of beautiful trees in our backyard. Our 280-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement converted</a> into a ping pong room for extra recreational space.</span></p>

<h3>Transformation outside the kitchen</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, the window that previously looked out on the old deck was converted to a passthrough window that now connects to the new sunroom. The kitchen countertop was extended about two feet to the end of the wall that divides the dining area and kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Off of the kitchen, we added a 280-square-foot sunroom that includes a bathroom, pantry room, and living area. We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs. The pantry provides tons of food, toy, and sports equipment storage. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor deck</a> is off of the sunroom and is 250 square feet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our favorite part of the renovation was working with the architect and our Sweeten general contractor on the layout of the new rooms.</span> <span class="s1">However, the most anxiety-provoking situation was waiting for support beams to be delivered and installed. For two days we had no roof and obsessed about checking the weather to make sure it didn’t rain! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had experience with all aspects of our project. He was great at giving us ideas and then executing the plan. We also shared the same taste in simple, modern, open design. He was able to deliver exactly what we envisioned. And if you need to file for city permits, our advice is to use an architect who can do that. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You don&#8217;t need to confine your living space to the inside of your home. Your backyard or side yard can offer a paradise of fresh air, natural light, plants, and flowers. Outdoor decks tie these two living spaces while also adding to the value of your home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of a deck as the perfect connection from inside to outside. An outdoor deck elevates users from the ground and provides a unique view of your property and beyond. Decks also can be a centerpiece of outdoor social life, a gathering place for barbecues, parties, or even restful solitude.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Decks are a great way to add space to your property,” said New Jersey-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5408#overview"><span class="s2">Sweeten general contractor Chris</span></a>. “By extending your outdoor living seasons, they basically make your home larger.” <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span></a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, explains what you need to know about building or renovating an outdoor deck.</span></p>
<h3>Types of outdoor decks</h3>
<h4><b>Freestanding</b> outdoor decks</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freestanding decks, also called floating or ground-level decks, hug closer to grade than attached decks. You can build these decks alongside the house or anywhere within the yard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many municipalities don&#8217;t require building permits for outdoor deck designs less than a certain height above grade (often 30 inches) and not built over a basement or lower story. The deck area may not be part of an accessible route to either of these lower areas. The deck should still follow all applicable building codes.</span></p>
<h4><b>Attached or fixed</b> decks</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Attached, or fixed, decks are more elaborate structures than freestanding decks. They may be taller, require special footings, use guards and handrails, and attach to the home with a ledger board. Because this deck design is complex, most homeowners will hire a contractor or other professional to build an attached deck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Attached decks better integrate with the home, compared to freestanding decks. Maxx, a designer for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6267#overview"><span class="s2">this Sweeten general contractor in Chicago</span></a>, said that his company aims to blur the line between inside and outside. “We allow the exterior to be an extension of the indoors,” he said, “and we like to have the indoor flow to the outside so that it doesn’t feel like an appendage. We like to take the whole-house approach.”</span></p>

<h3>How do you build an outdoor deck?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building a new outdoor deck will require all of the following steps, while renovating a deck may involve only a subset. Building a new deck usually takes between 1 and 3 weeks.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The homeowner meets with the deck builder to discuss their vision for the deck. The builder may advise the homeowner on appropriate styles and designs.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Next, the team draws up detailed blueprints and prices out materials to create a solid cost estimate for the homeowner.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The builder submits deck plans to the building department. City technicians visit to mark the site so digging doesn&#8217;t damage underground services.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">They prepare the site by staking out string around the outline of the deck, and removing any necessary sod.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">After establishing the position of the piers and footers, the builders create the the deck: dig the holes; set the piers and footers; install the ledger board on the house; install the posts, followed by beams and joists.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">After they establish the general structure, they attach and trim the decking boards.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">They add additional features, such as stairs and railings.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If needed, they stain the deck, and seal it for weather resistance.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>What materials are used in outdoor decking?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pressure-treated lumber is the most common material for the lower structural part of the deck. Although code requirements may determine lower decking materials, there are several options available for the top deck. One way to renovate a deck is to remove old deck materials from an existing deck and replace them. This method reduces costs since the entire outdoor decking structure does not need to be rebuilt.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Composites: </b>Most composite material is made of recycled plastics and wood fibers. Wood composite is a popular material due to its softness underfoot and durability. Wood composite decks don&#8217;t ever need staining or sealing. However, colors can fade over time, especially in sunnier areas. While composites are low-maintenance, they are not maintenance-free. Like other outdoor decking materials, you must periodically clean composite wood of moss, mold, and mildew, especially if the deck is in shade.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Fiberglass:&nbsp;</b>“Fiberglass deck material is very popular now,” said Chris. “It can be painted or stained and it lasts forever.” Slip-resistant fiberglass panels overlap to form a continuous solid surface, which is beneficial when decking over a lower area needs to stay dry. Fiberglass deck panels do not rot, rust, or harbor mildew; which makes this material ideal for high-moisture conditions.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Tropical hardwoods:&nbsp;</b>Ipe and tigerwood are two common species of tropical hardwoods used for decking materials. These dense woods are difficult to cut and drill, but their density means that the deck’s longevity will beat that of pressure-treated wood, redwood, and cedar. Because of their natural fire resistance, building codes may allow some tropical hardwoods in situations where other woods aren&#8217;t an option. Tropical hardwoods are expensive—but they may help both the deck and the home maintain value over the years, even into resale.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Redwood and cedar:&nbsp;</b>Redwood and cedar are softwoods mainly sourced from western states. These materials are a good compromise between expensive tropical hardwoods and pressure-treated wood. These kinds of wood are imbued with natural tannins and oils, and do not require chemical preservatives.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Pressure-treated wood:&nbsp;</b>The most economical choice is pressure-treated wood. Southern yellow pine, which is pressure-injected with chemicals that help the wood resist rot and wood-boring insects, is popular. One disadvantage to pressure-treated wood decking is that the wood splinters easily and isn&#8217;t safe for walking on with bare feet. Be sure to always coat pressure-treated deck materials on top to extend their durability. Because of these issues, Sweeten contractor Chris says that pressure-treated wood has become less popular for upper deck materials, though it is always used for the lower structure.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What is the best time to build an outdoor deck?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inclement weather will complicate any building project. Tarping the deck during rain or snow may improve conditions during construction, but it&#8217;s usually easier for crews to work without a cover. Frozen ground can slow digging. Late spring to mid-fall is the most comfortable and efficient time to build or renovate. Nevertheless, most deck builders work year-round. The trick to working through all seasons, said Chris, is to dig the holes for the footers in advance—before the ground freezes.</span></p>

<h3><strong>How much does it cost to build an outdoor deck?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The average national cost for a deck addition is $14,360, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs Value</span></a> report. A composite deck returns 66.8% of its cost in added home value, while a wood deck returns 72.1%. Premium decks with full-service features, similar to all-purpose outdoor entertainment areas, can range up to 2,000 square feet in suburban areas. Deck sizes in downtown areas tend to be smaller (between 70 to 120 square feet), but the decks are often higher and with multiple levels. Costs can range from $40,000 to $60,000, increasing with extra features. For example, when a deck extends and includes larger amenities, like a swimming pool, costs can exceed $100,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Facini,&nbsp; deck-building costs are highly variable. They depend on factors like decking materials, condition of the site, grade, number of decks and their height, plus special items like glass railings. Generally, you can expect decking material to cost around $20 to $30 per square foot for composites or tropical hardwoods like teak. Overall, total costs generally range from $25,000 to $30,000.</span></p>

			<h3>An overview of how to start planning for your outdoor remodel</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50622" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Outdoor remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sprucing up the out-of-doors</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether your outdoor space is seasonal or livable all year-round, having an exterior spot to relax is an upgrade in lifestyle and property value. You may be wondering how to make the most out of a rooftop deck or an urban backyard. Preparing for an outdoor remodel has many moving parts—some projects more complex than others. We break down how to begin planning and share a timeline so your green space can be ready by summertime.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Decide on your outdoor space plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Santi, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who transformed <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V.’s backyard</a>, shared the following advice with us: “Just like any other project around the house, I recommend taking some time to decide what your goal is” for your outdoor space. Will you be using the space primarily for dining, grilling, gardening, or play? Decide what you want to prioritize: functionality or ornamentation. If there are kids involved, that will be a determining factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning her attention to her brownstone’s backyard, K.V. knew she wanted to use the space to host friends and barbecues. She took inspiration from gardens in Mexico and Brazil, leaning toward a more tropical atmosphere. A tall cedar fence to provide privacy was a must-have.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate remodeled <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their rooftop deck</a> to double as a &#8220;bonus room&#8221; for hanging out. It was outfitted with comfortable seating and plants to make it feel cozy. However, the rooftop felt open and exposed, so a visual barrier of plantings was placed along the perimeter. The couple also brought in a fire pit for chilly, late-summer nights.</p>
<h3>Be flexible with material choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">K.V. had her heart set on bluestone to create a walkway to the elevated patio in her backyard. “She had a budget she didn’t want to go over,&#8221; Santi said. &#8220;She asked us to price out bluestone, but it was a little too high, so we looked for other materials.&#8221; He added, “Homeowners should always price projects with different materials [because] changing the materials doesn’t mean changing the final goal or look of the design.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a surprise twist, they discovered bluestone buried under the dirt in the yard during demolition. K.V.&#8217;s backyard remodel paved the ground with gravel, pavers, and bluestone. While a budget might limit some choices, your contractor may be able to suggest alternative materials that fit the budget and achieve the look you want.</p>
<h3>Choosing plants for color, texture, and to enhance privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We asked Justin, a horticulturist at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>, to fill us in on how to choose the right plants. “The first and most important thing is to get a realistic sense of your area’s growing conditions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consider the sun, moisture, and exposure to wind, and then pick plants that like or at least tolerate what your space has to offer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those sunny spots, Justin recommends heat-loving tropical plants, such as hibiscus, mandevilla, and allamanda. In shady areas, birds of paradise and majesty palm are perfect for adding drama. Croton and colorful aglaonema provide a pop of color. If you choose plants that won’t survive the winter, keep them in a pot so you can bring them indoors when temperatures drop.</p>
<p>Nate and Michelle turned to landscaping to soften their space. Their landscape designer proposed lavender and feather reed grass to frame the seating area and a Japanese Maple tree. Justin also suggests other tall plants, like arborvitae, columnar juniper, and yew for privacy.</p>
<p>In K.V.’s yard, Santi filled in the spotty grass with fresh sod to transform the lawn into a thick green carpet. He also added a row of mulch along one wall for a small but manageable garden. Potted plants fill out the patio and walkway, providing color and texture.</p>

<h3>Choose low-maintenance plants and automated irrigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors, New Yorkers prefer outdoor spaces that are low maintenance. A landscape plan with a three-season oasis, automated irrigation in the morning, flowering shrubs during the day, and accent lights illuminating trees and fences at night would be ideal. If you find yourself unlucky in plant-love, Justin has some advice: “Coleus is a fun choice that thrives in sun or shade and has delightful, dramatically colored foliage you can enjoy from spring to frost.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Similarly, consider sweet potato vine: It spills down over the side of a planter, creating an elegant look. It also grows as a groundcover or can be trained to grow up a trellis or other structure,&#8221; Justin said. &#8220;Torenia, also called wishbone flower, is another option you can grow in sun or shade.” And if watering is your biggest concern, he advises planting mandevilla, lantana, angelonia, purslane, and evolvulus.</p>
<p class="p1">For the renovation, your landscape design should be set before demolition begins, said NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5301#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Shenna</a>. “The design will determine where plumbing and electrical lines are run, as well as the rough-in for the sprinkler system,” she said. “These are laid down right after demolition.” However, there&#8217;s time with final landscaping choices. They get planted around the last month or so of the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Plan your outdoor remodel in the off-season</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to remodel a green space, start planning and working in the off-season. For those not ready to plant or are just building up towards a green thumb, use the warm seasons to find inspiration, and plan during winter.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a typical timeline to guide you. Pro tip: Start the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the fall, begin mapping out the design, landscaping, and materials with an architect/designer/contractor. “Planning, designing, and finalizing the fine details of the project can take months,” said Shenna. This gives the contractor enough time to work with the homeowner and/or designer to get all of the pieces in place.</p>
<p class="p1">By December, permits should be submitted, your contractor hired, and materials ordered (keep delivery times in mind).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Demolition should break ground by March/April for an outdoor remodel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The best time to physically start working on an outdoor space is in the spring.” said Shenna. “The weather makes it possible to get everything prepped and ready.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg" alt="Backyard deck area with horizontal wooden fencing and barbeque grill after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50569" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Managing the outdoor remodel infrastructure</h4>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6256#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor</span></a> Mike, who is based in NYC said, “The scope of the project, the square footage of the outdoor space, and material delays” will affect how much time goes into the planning phase in advance. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. However, an outdoor kitchen that requires plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals than a deck remodel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an outdoor space, there’s a lot more to consider, like drainage. Your general contractor should have an in-depth understanding of how bulk water will be managed and how your plans will impact the neighbors. If you’re working on a roof, make sure you have access points for clearing roof drains.</p>
<h4>Organizing material delivery and approvals</h4>
<p class="p1">Your team will also have to haul all of the materials to your outdoor space. Hauling roof deck lumber, soil, sod, and plant matter up through service elevators can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative is booming materials to the roof by crane. Contractors usually have partnerships with local greenhouses and lumber yards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They can move materials from the street to a garden more efficiently and cost-effectively than using a service elevator.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, make sure you have the necessary approvals. Most exterior improvements will require an alteration agreement and approval from the building&#8217;s architect, and many will require filing with the city. If you live in a landmarked building, special regulations will apply.</p>
<p class="p1">Start and plan early with the right professionals onboard. A well-planned deck or garden can greatly increase the value of a property. It will be time and money well-spent.

<span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Michelle and Nate&#8217;s <a style="color: #76808f;" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deck renovation</a> in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Serving as either an open gathering place or a cozy retreat, the deck has become a popular alternative to the patio and porch. Outdoor deck materials have improved in durability and beauty, with a range of types to choose from. Rather than choosing based on looks alone, it&#8217;s useful to know the pros and cons of the most common material options available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Importance of the deck&#8217;s foundation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how you design it or outfit it with planters and pergolas, at its essence the deck is a large outdoor platform. Typically, it is connected to the house, and raised from the ground anywhere from a few inches to several feet. This is in contrast to a patio, which is made of stone or concrete and set into the earth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though made from moisture-resistant or repellent material, decks should be isolated from the ground by supports set into concrete footers. Contact with soil will eventually rot any kind of wood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decking boards come in specially milled or manufactured sizes that are typically 2-by-4s, though widths can vary from a given manufacturer to provide you with more design options. Look for rounded edges that resist splintering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find many choices for joining systems. Some systems conceal screw heads, for a cleaner appearance and and to keep water from seeping into screw holes. Other systems are designed to allow expansion and contraction of the boards. “Decking boards with slotted sides can be installed using a clip system, so you do not have to surface fasten the boards,” says Doug L. Mucher, Senior Marketing Manager for <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/decking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>. “This provides a cleaner installation.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-10.jpg" alt="large wooden patio and swimming pool with wooden deck and cable railing dividing patio and deck after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51209 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Zoning and local codes for outdoor decks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure your deck is in compliance, deck supports are best installed by an experienced contractor who knows the local codes and zoning laws. Some cities or counties require approval from the planning commission and inspections during the building process. Keep in mind: these rules might limit your grand plans, or require some creative adaptations. It&#8217;s wise to consult with your contractor before proceeding with the build. “Most homeowners can handle replacing the deck surface,” says Mucher. “However, if the project requires the deck substructure to be built as well, you’ll most likely want to hire a contractor. A contractor can be required to make sure it is built to code.”</p>
<h3>How to choose outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Your choice of outdoor deck materials will be driven by your lifestyle, taste, and local climate. Does your area get a lot of rain and humidity? Heat and sun? Most modern deck materials can withstand any climate, but some require more upkeep than others to stay in good shape and appearance, especially in harsher climates.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Different types of outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Wood continues to be a popular choice. If you like classic materials, you can choose from a range of softwoods and hardwoods. You&#8217;ll get good-to-great performance, as long as you follow a regular maintenance routine. There are some synthetic alternatives, too. Consider the following:</p>
<h4>Pressure-treated pine hardwood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: This is an inexpensive softwood that&#8217;s been impregnated with chemical preservatives, making it more resistant to insects and to splitting, swelling, and rot from humidity than other woods. It&#8217;s easy to paint. It&#8217;s also strong, and well-suited to the structural parts of the deck, even if you choose different woods for the deck surface and other visible elements. Pressure-treated pine is the thriftiest option, so it&#8217;s good for homeowners on a strict budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: It is a natural material and requires frequent maintenance to assure top performance. Pressure-treated pine is not as attractive as some other popular wood options, including cedar or redwood. As with all real wood, it can splinter. Upkeep includes deep cleaning and application of a lumber preservative annually as well as occasional sanding. The chemicals used in the pressure treatment are toxic. This isn&#8217;t typically a problem in an outdoor setting, but some homeowners prefer to keep this treated wood in places like the deck&#8217;s support structure, where they won&#8217;t have to come in direct contact with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $1.50 per square foot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg" alt="Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50575 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Non-treated wood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: There’s a reason why many synthetic decking materials simulate the look of wood. There is nothing like this natural material for its warmth and expression of quality. The most popular softwood species are cedar and redwood, for their good looks and natural moisture resistance. Natural tannins and oils resist insects well, and these woods are easy to stain, paint, and seal. Some decks are built with tropical hardwoods, such as ipe, which are incredibly resilient, and in some cases are accepted by fire codes that otherwise require concrete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Even hardwoods are not as long-lasting as plastics. Wood can dent, split, splinter, fade, and require frequent upkeep to maintain the best appearance and life. You will need to not only wash with a wood cleaner or pressure-washer, but also seal it at least once annually. Best to sweep daily or weekly to avoid damage from gritty dirt. Darker shades will heat up in sunlight, making them unpleasant underfoot in the summer when you are likely to spend the most time there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot for cedar; from $6 per square foot for redwood, $8 per square foot for ipe.</p>
<h4>Composite</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: Made from wood fibers bound by a resin, synthetic decking is nearly maintenance-free. It will not warp, splinter, or rot, and it repels insects. It requires no stain or sealing and offers a wide selection of simulated wood looks and colors. It also can be molded and so lends itself to curved shapes. It requires little care except cleaning with soapy water and a soft-bristle brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Surfaces in darker colors can become hot in the sun and may fade over time. It can melt if exposed to high heat, such as from a grill. Scratches can’t be buffed out, and dropped greasy foods might leave stains. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $5 per square foot.</p>
<h4>PVC</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a thermoplastic that can be shaped and formed into a variety of products including decking. A particularly hard plastic, it won’t scratch, warp, rot, split, or stain; it’s lightweight and easy to install and requires no annual treatments other than cleaning with soap and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: More limited palette than composite. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Vinyl</h4>
<p>PRO: Lightweight vinyl is comprised of PVC and polyethylene. Available in faux-wood styles and textures, this material is easy to install thanks to its light weight and ease of slicing with a saw. It never needs painting, resists staining and fading, and won’t heat up, unlike natural wood and some composites. Easy to clean with soap and water.</p>
<p>CON: Over time, it may sag. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $3 per square foot.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How to personalize your outdoor deck</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve narrowed down your choice of material, you can think about ways to customize the deck. “With all the styles and colors available, homeowners are really only limited by their imagination,” says Mucher.</p>
<h4>Outdoor deck design ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mix different colors or shades of planks</li>
<li>Combine different plank widths</li>
<li>Run planks in different directions to create a pattern, like a herringbone or a fan</li>
<li>Add a contrasting border</li>

<h4>Make the deck resemble an actual room:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create steps and two or more levels for different activities, such as relaxing, dining, taking in the view</li>
<li>Install an outdoor kitchen, chiminea (freestanding, front-loading fireplace or oven), or spa</li>
<li>Incorporate a pergola or a lanai</li>
<li>Include lighting, for use at night or to highlight an area</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, most decks, particularly those that are raised or tiered, include a railing. You can match your deck material or choose a complementary style or finish. Work with your contractor to make sure all the necessary elements are incorporated, for safety and security as well as environment and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Invest time in planning and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selecting a vetted general contractor</a> to guide you through the process. You want your deck to be dependable and a space you enjoy sharing with family and guests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>To outfit this crowd-pleaser, choose the right spot to build; add a good grill and other outdoor kitchen appliances</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25421 size-chrono" title="outdoor kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg" alt="outdoor kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(Above) This Kalamazoo outdoor kitchen features a built-in grill, weather-tight cabinets, refrigerator drawers, and a pizza oven sitting on the countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to eat out more often, but hate spending a fortune on restaurants, you should consider an outdoor kitchen. While you can spend almost as much on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/outdoor-kitchen-patio-ideas/">outdoor kitchen</a> as your indoor one, it’ll ultimately add resale value to your home. In a recent study, the National Association of Home Builders reported that outdoor kitchens add at least 100 percent of their value to a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the most of your outdoor kitchen, consider carefully these points:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance your outdoor kitchen space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work with your contractor on finding the ideal location to build out your kitchen. Classic materials like brick, stone, or stucco can work nicely with many architectural styles of a home. These materials work especially well with older homes—and appear integrated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Make your outdoor kitchen comfortable</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allow room for dining and lounging both before and after the meal. You&#8217;ll need a shady or covered area paved with stone or wood to support furniture. You also want to add lighting for the dining and seating area, plus the kitchen area. This way, you&#8217;ll enjoy the space after sundown, while having an <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/entertaining-kitchens/">open plan that keeps the cook near the guests</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pick outdoor kitchen appliances wisely</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buy only what you know you will really use. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Avoid fixtures that serve only one function, unless you will use them regularly</a>. If your family loves pizza, by all means, add the pizza oven. If you entertain frequently, you can use a warming drawer. But do you really need that smoker?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Invest in high-quality outdoor kitchen materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything that goes into your outdoor kitchen should be made to work outdoors. But, still, everything you have installed will remain outside year-round, so it needs to be able to withstand changing weather. Buy from brands with national reputations so you can get a customer service person when you need one, including on the weekend. Also, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ways-care-renovated-home/">check the warranties</a> to make certain the company will back up their products.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point, an appliance or pipe will have to be repaired or possibly replaced. Work with your contractor to design installation so that electrical, gas, and water can be easily reached for repair or adjustment, if needed, without breaking down any beautiful stone surround or concrete foundation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan the setup and location of your outdoor kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your setup can be built-in or freestanding, depending on its location in relation to the structure of your house. Freestanding is quicker to get up and running, and you can take some features (like the grill) with you, should you move. However, built-in gives a more designed look and allows for optional but important features like a sink. ”If they are relatively close together, an outdoor kitchen can utilize the indoor kitchen’s capabilities, such as prep space and storage,” says Russ Faulk, chief designer and head of product for <a href="https://kalamazoogourmet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet</a>, a manufacturer of outdoor kitchen appliances. “Conversely, a fully independent outdoor kitchen with refrigeration, warming cabinets and cabinetry is more self-reliant, but will require more space and connections for gas, water, and electricity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also outdoor kitchen appliance “kits” from companies like EP Henry. These include everything—the grill, cabinets, countertop, even bricks for the surrounding structure, plus a sink. Only experienced DIYers should put this combo together and will need to pull all the permits for construction and utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the location of a built-in kitchen, if you place it against an outer wall of your house, you won’t have to run water and gas lines as far as if you were to locate it some further distance within the yard. You will, however, likely need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/">ventilation hood to prevent cooking smells from drifting</a> into your house. Work with an experienced contractor who can help you maximize your budget by finding the best location for easy utility access. He or she will also be able to tell you if you need that vent hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location (and climate) will also be a factor as to whether your outdoor kitchen grill station should be sheltered or exposed. Even appliances made for outdoor use shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to driving rain or snow, or prolonged, sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Always check to see if a permit is necessary before starting your outdoor kitchen project,” advises Russ. Your contractor can handle this, as he or she should be highly knowledgeable about local codes. These codes would include easement, permeable surface requirements, water restrictions, and height restrictions. Besides getting help with all those permits, learn about the other benefits of working with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed contractor</a> on your outdoor kitchen project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing the right features</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outdoor kitchen can be as large and tricked out as your space and budget will allow, but to make it fully functional, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">outfit it like you do the indoor kitchen</a>, with designated areas for prep, cooking, and clean-up, as well as dining and hanging out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: The grill</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the center of any kitchen is the stove or, in this case, an outdoor kitchen grill.  Outdoors kitchen grills can be as sophisticated as you want, with two, three, or five burners, plus an accompanying warming drawer, side burners, and pizza oven. Confirm that whatever outdoor grill you choose is from an established manufacturer that specializes in grills and offers a solid warranty.  If you’re in the market for a freestanding outdoor kitchen grill, look at companies like KitchenAid, Dacor, and Monogram. These brands are known for their indoor cooking appliances, and also offer outdoor gas-operated products. Their outdoor products have modern combos of multiple burners and side grills, which let you cook several items simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers devoted just to grills, like Weber, also offer plenty of choice for both freestanding and built-ins. Check that the area below the grill can handle the grill&#8217;s weight, and the heat it will emit, as well as any sparks that might fly out. The counter or workspace should be adjacent to the grill and burners. Make sure you can sanitize it for food preparation. “Keep a buffer zone between hot grills, ovens or cooktops and any people,” says Russ, who recommends a minimum of 9 inches of countertop extension behind and to the sides of all hot appliances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: A fridge or freezer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably don’t need a full-size fridge outside. An under-counter version will do the trick to chill protein until cook time, while keeping drinks cold. If you have the room, you could enjoy two fridges, one for food and one for beverages. The most common width for under-counter models is 24 inches, but 21- and 18-inch versions, as well as drawers, are available from major commercial fridge makers like Summit. Expect to pay $1,000 to $2,000 (for a double-drawer version)—as much as a grill. Make sure the model you buy is UL-listed and rated food-safe for outdoor use.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Sinks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sink, while not mandatory, makes outdoor entertaining much easier. You&#8217;ll be able to rinse hands and wash dishes, so you don’t have to take dirty dishes back into the house, or fill up a water pitcher. You&#8217;ll just need a water line connected to your home water supply, or a hook-up through a hose if you just need cold water. You’ll want weather-resistant 16-gauge stainless-steel for the sink. Then ask yourself, single or double basin? Splurge on a bar station that includes a sink, plus condiment trays, and an insulated ice bucket from Home Depot. Or, supplement your cook station with a modular side burner and sink combo from Master Forge. Wondering about a dishwasher? Demand is low so they are hard to find. Best to rinse dishes in that sink and cart the load to the house to finish inside.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Lighting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For comfort and aesthetics, outdoor lighting is a no-brainer. It’s also necessary for safety. As with the indoor kitchen, you want the prep and grill areas well-lit. Dining and seating areas can get by with softer, ambient lighting, but make sure pathways are lit so no one stumbles at night. Your contractor can help you determine the appropriate outdoor options for spotlights focused on task areas, as well as pendant, post, or string lighting to illuminate the dining and lounging areas, and lantern or path lighting for groundcover. Again, you want fixtures made to be operated outdoors, but look for LED versions. This option is preferable because LEDs give off little heat, can handle temperature swings from -40F to 180F, and last up to 10 years or for 100,000 hours of continuous use. You’ll find the widest range of selection at box stores where you can see the lights illuminated to help you decide if you like the effect.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tip: Keep convenience within reach</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your contractor is running lines for utilities, ask them to include electrical outlets for small appliances, like a blender, portable stereo, and space heaters. Your contractor will know the correct type of outdoor outlets, which should be ground fault circuit interpreter (GFCI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking on the grill is a great American pastime, whether entertaining friends or feeding your family. Maximize your enjoyment by adding some sizzle to al fresco dining with a beautiful, super-functional outdoor kitchen.</p>

<p class="p1">Enjoy a change of scenery in your own home. Outdoor spaces present an increase in living space and an upgrade to lifestyle. However, not all backyards are ready for “prime time” and a remodel is in order. NYC landscaping costs for the backyard include scope, flooring, demolition, fencing, electrical, and structures.</p>
<p class="p1">Fortunately, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every outdoor space can be improved</a> substantially with some great ideas and expert help. Our guide will help you understand the most common elements to consider in NYC with some tips from our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors. </p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Building an outdoor space: where to start</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor space runs the gamut from a simple patio to a full outdoor kitchen. What you can achieve at your home is going to be limited by three main factors: space available, your budget, and building codes. Of those three factors, codes might be the most perplexing—and least flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the most part, building codes exist for safety and you can either comply or change the design. They’re not that onerous for most outdoor projects, but you might face challenges from setbacks, for example. That means you can’t build right up to the property line in certain cases. Once you <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose a NYC contractor</a> to work with, your GC will be invaluable in guiding you through design decisions that meet your desires <i>and</i> codes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Space available and budget are easier to grasp. When your contractor gives you a good idea of the buildable space and rough estimates for your “must-haves” and optional features, you can get going on your plan. Do a deep dive and check out projects that appeal to you. Creating a photo montage of completed projects that get you all frothy is a fun way to design!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg" alt="Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50617" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) General contractor Santiago renovated this <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard space</a> for Sweeten homeowner KV Harper</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Backyard landscaping cost: Outdoor flooring </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Knowing how you want to use your space is the first step to setting the budget. The outdoor-room concept is multi-faceted. Some people don’t want much besides a table for meals, others want to sunbathe, some want a spa, and the cooks want a full kitchen. Whatever your wants, you’ll have to start at the bottom: what you walk on. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you have an existing patio or roof to use, great, then you can move on to other elements. If your space does need some help with the flooring, though, you’ll find a host of possibilities. One of the most popular options, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Santiago</a> in New York, is bluestone patios. This material is durable and beautiful, if fairly expensive. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone is a natural stone paver that offers beauty, durability, and flexibility. Cut bluestone pavers will cost from around $8/square foot for 1” thick stone and is available in many sizes. Smaller stones of about 12” square will give you a slightly different aesthetic than huge slabs, and are definitely easier to work with. Access can be a challenge in the city, and you might have to spring for a crane if you want large, heavy stones. There’s just no other way to move them in tight spaces. This process will cost you at least $2,000, not including the stone and site preparation. Smaller sizes are more manageable, though, and can be hauled by hand if necessary.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Concrete pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To spend less, “Concrete pavers are available in dozens of size and color options for $4–5/square foot,” Santiago said. In addition, they don’t need a crane for installation. Installation for both concrete and stone pavers will be the same, with costs varying depending on the current base rather than the material you choose. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calculating your backyard landscaping costs</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Determining your </span><span class="s2">backyard landscaping costs</span></a><span class="s1"> are also determined by demolition work. That type of work will vary by what you have in place now, so contractors don’t want to guess on costs. Do you have an existing patio that must be removed? Or grass? How good is the access? Are you working on the ground floor or higher up? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are so many variables that rough estimates without seeing the site aren’t possible, our contractors said. They need to see what’s there first and learn what you want before they can give an estimate. </span>Post your project on Sweeten to discuss the possibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="s1">“I have to look at the job; two jobs are never alike. Labor is not easy to price. There are a lot of elements factoring in,” Santiago noted.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">NYC-based Sweeten general contractor Steve concurred, saying that there are backyard remodeling jobs where all materials have to come in and out through the front door. “A lot of the time you have to take the garbage out through the first floor, out the basement, or out the window. Everything has to be protected.”</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to patios, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decks are popular</a> and sometimes do not require demolition and hauling out old materials. Decks can offer great flexibility in fitting into existing spaces, and they can also be particularly budget-friendly by overlaying an existing shabby concrete slab, saving the cost and hassle of demolition and removal.</span></p>
<h3>When to start planning your outdoor space</h3>
<p><span>Enjoy your green space for the summer by starting the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the Fall, begin planning with an architect/designer/contractor on design, landscaping, and materials. By December submit permits, hire your contractor, and order materials (keep delivery times in mind). Demolition should break ground by March/April. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. Although an outdoor kitchen requiring plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals vs a deck remodel.</span><span> </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Creating fencing and perimeter walls</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fences and walls, too, are basic elements of most projects, and serve several functions. Privacy is usually a main concern, but view control and wind control are also important. Most people opt for wood fences, said Steve. As for design elements, “People in general want big wide planks; materials that are more architectural looking, with bright backgrounds,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“It depends on each client. Some people want a lot of space for seating. For all intents and purposes it’s an outside living room,” he noted. Fences offer a lot of design freedom, as well, including horizontal and vertical elements, natural wood tones or painted surfaces, and using wood, stone, and/or metal. “Most people do wood fencing,” Sweeten contractor Santiago said, “some choose pressure-treated, while others opt for cedar. It depends on the budget.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor lighting </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some details, such as lighting, are easy to overlook at first. It’s a major element in both ambiance and useability, however, and should be tackled at the design stage rather than tacked on later.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Everyone is into lighting,” Santiago said. “For this, you&#8217;ll need to factor in outlets. Floodlights can accent the plants. They can be simple but very cool.” Lighting and electrical are simple and easy compared to some other elements, but they require planning for running buried lines and removing overhead lines. When your contractor has a design for you, then it’s time to consider the lighting based on function. Lighting in the dining area is different from lighting for walkways and for plants. It’s all part of the design process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding pergolas and arbors</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As another distinct element, pergolas and arbors provide shade, structure, and beauty to your outdoor room, as well as an often-needed vertical feature. Arbors are simple and small structures that often frame a pathway, while pergolas are larger and more substantial, sometimes attached to the house. You might train vines or climbing roses on the arbor, for example. Pergolas can use a slatted, cloth, or solid roofing material, making them flexible so you have both sun and shelter in your yard.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Landscaping front yard</span><span class="s3"> options</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In New York City, front yard spaces aren’t as common, but you can still add natural beauty. In addition to using fine materials for your front entry, steps, and railing, do you have room for planters? If you like plants, this is a great option for tight spaces and lets you add some color and texture. If live plants are too much work or tough to keep alive, planters can also house durable and seasonal items like spruce tops. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can see a multitude of high-quality planters and pots online, and talk with your contractor about building some that fit your space exactly. Many people choose cedar for this project, as it’s beautiful and relatively rot-resistant. Other woods work fine, too, and can look great finished in paint or stain. Add your ideas to your photo montage and discuss with your renovation team.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Landscaping costs</span><span class="s1"> for homes in New York City can be tough to estimate without a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit from several firms</a>. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home or outdoor remodel, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with the right local contractor</a> to get you to your dream space. </span></p>

A general contractor will need to view the site and walk through your wish list before an estimate can be given.

Other costs depend on the nature of the demolition required and if any perimeter fencing or structures, like pergolas, will be installed. Costs will increase if outdoor lighting requires running buried electrical lines. The contractor uses these factors and more to determine labor costs.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10481 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_cover-41.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="385" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_cover-41.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_cover-41-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nate &amp; Michelle had just about finished settling into their Greenpoint condo last spring, when it came time for the new homeowners to tackle their unfinished roof deck with its killer skyline views. The couple, both creative professionals in advertising, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on Sweeten</a> to find someone who could help convert the derelict roof into an extension of their home &#8212; an outdoor room with comfortable seating and plants to soften up the space. We introduced them to a few matches, and before long, they awarded their project to Sweeten member Hutson Landscape, owned by Corey Hutson, whose expertise in landscape design &amp; construction was a perfect fit. When we stopped by to see how the project turned out, Nate, Michelle, and their bouncy labradoodle, &#8220;Kid,&#8221; were setting up to host some friends on their renovated roof.<span id="more-10460"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10465 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-1c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="389" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-1c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-1c-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10466 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-1c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="389" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-1c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-1c-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In just 2 months, Corey and his team were able to turn the bleak roof space into a polished outdoor room. The homeowners selected plantings based on Corey&#8217;s recommendations: lavender &amp; feather reed grass to line the perimeter, and a Japanese Maple tree to frame the skyline view. The tall feather reed grass is nice for adding a little privacy, and when the wind blows, Michelle says, &#8220;it sounds like palm trees,&#8221; which she loves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowners also told us that Corey suggested bringing a water line up to their roof so that they&#8217;d have easy access for watering the plantings and keeping Kid&#8217;s bowl full &#8212; something they never would have thought of themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10467 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-2c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-2c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-2c-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10468 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-2c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-2c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-2c-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To furnish, Nate &amp; Michelle selected a pair of outdoor sofas and matching side tables from Room &amp; Board, and to extend their use of the space into the fall, they also purchased a fire pit that converts to a coffee table when covered (not pictured). The setup is perfect for transitioning from lounging in the sun with a book, to hosting a party; Kid is also more than content, with plenty of space to play tug-of-war (and lots of cushions to warm as well).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10469 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_after-3c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="390" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_after-3c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_after-3c-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Jealousy. Envy. Disbelief.&#8221; are the reactions Michelle has gotten from her friends &#8212; maybe someone should tell them about Sweeten?! Congrats and many thanks to Nate, Michelle &amp; Kid, too!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And don&#8217;t forget, if you have a <em><span style="color: #000000;">kid,</span></em> of your own, enter to win our Home School #7 giveaway, a Growing Up with Design package worth over $2100!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re off to a beach bungalow in the Hamptons to get our last taste of summer and catch up with tS member firm Uli &amp; Associates (formally Fractal Construction). Firm owner and lead architect, Ulises &#8220;Uli&#8221; Liceaga walked us through the recent renovation of his own summer home, this little 800 square foot, 2 bedroom bungalow, which he retrofitted for his family of 7 &#8212; yep, Uli and his wife Christina have 5 kids, all under the age of 8! The family enjoys a particularly active lifestyle; they especially love biking, horseback riding, kitesurfing and wakeboarding, and they spend a lot of time in the Hamptons during the summers. So, a few years ago they purchased their own house at Amagansett&#8217;s Lazy Point, a kitesurfing and windsurfing mecca. While the location was perfect, the house itself was far from it, and Uli immediately got to work designing his family&#8217;s new beach bungalow.<span id="more-9802"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9890" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow.jpg" alt="03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The before conditions were dark, cramped and outdated, so the main objectives of the renovation were to open up and modernize the space. One of the biggest challenges for the designer was working within the 800 sqft footprint of the original home. Due to building restrictions in the Hamptons it&#8217;s really hard to get approval for exterior changes, which meant that Uli had to figure out how he would accommodate his dynamic family without expanding the size of the home. A second big challenge came when there was a delay in the closing of the house, and they ended up with only a month to do the renovation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen those shows where they renovate a house in a few weeks time, well that&#8217;s what we did. I grabbed a couple of crews and we worked weekends and long days. It took about 21 days. I set up a trailer there, and stayed there. People don&#8217;t believe me when I tell them how long it actually took. When I look back I can&#8217;t believe we did it.&#8221;</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9891" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1.jpg" alt="02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett" width="600" height="440" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once construction started, it quickly became clear that a full-scale gut renovation was necessary, as the house&#8217;s structural shell turned out to be completely rotten. Outside, the original deck was so rotted out that you couldn&#8217;t tell where it began or ended. The local conservation codes also prevented Uli from changing the footprint of the deck in the new design, so, after removing its decayed remnants, the team did their best to reconstruct the deck&#8217;s original form.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside the finished space, the transformation is astounding! We love the exposed cedar framework; Uli effectively modernized the original design by stripping the building down to its most basic form. He then highlighted the rebuilt structure by using simple but beautiful materials and finishes. An additional bonus is that the exposed trusses also make a great place to store the family&#8217;s surf boards! At the back, the all new kitchen features new stainless steel appliances and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/">glass door cabinets from Ikea</a>. Other modern furnishings throughout the home are from Room and Board including a desk and <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/">storage shelves</a> made from reclaimed wood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The functional-meets-whimsical design of Uli&#8217;s beach retreat was inspired not only by his unique family, but by the architect&#8217;s belief that successful design is about responding to the needs of modern living. The finished bungalow is indeed modern yet very practical.</p>
