yes it is fair to ask consumers to take the higher ground. If you don&#039;t buy at brick and mortar stores they will cease to exist. I you want to see what the product looks like in person then support those that are giving you that luxury.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Marissa, I also visited manufacturer showrooms, which in New York City are a decent number. In one of these a very knowledgable sales person, when seeing the architect&#039;s spec for a specific corner cabinet&#039;s insert, he showed me, by example on the floor, how it never would have worked in my tiny kitchen. He offered an alternative which turned out to be the exact solution and now functions perfectly. I would also add when visiting showrooms plumbing supply, furniture houses, etc., bring your floor plan and carry a tape measure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve gone to showrooms that don&#039;t handle sales so there&#039;s no pressure but you can get a product demonstration.For some of the kitchen appliance showrooms you can even get a meal. In NYC they&#039;re housed in the D&#038;D design building. I had lunch at the Miele showroom and the Bosch showroom (at the time, in Brooklyn). I made my purchases elsewhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am simply a consumer but I&#039;m against &quot;show rooming&quot;. Some of those who work in showrooms may be on commission so you are wasting their time. I&#039;ve shopped both on line and in showrooms. If you look in a showroom, buy in one. You are presumably already getting a trade discount. Can you imagine not having showrooms to see products? It&#039;s ludicrous to think they should have prices equal to on line sources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[^^ I&#039;m not sure people are obligated to pay higher prices for walking into a store. I&#039;m all for supporting local shops and workers but everyone has to adjust to the ecommerce reality in some way -  unless an online source is doing something unethical, is it fair to ask consumers to take the higher ground?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#1 is so irresponsible! The showrooms are providing you a service. They gave you the opportunity to shop for your appliances, tiles, fixtures and decide what you want. They pay rent, salaries for local workers, insurance and local taxes. Of course online sellers are cheaper -- they don&#039;t have to provide you with any of those services that your local showrooms provide. If you can afford a fancy new kitchen, and if you made your decision by visiting a showroom, do the right thing and buy from them.]]></description>
