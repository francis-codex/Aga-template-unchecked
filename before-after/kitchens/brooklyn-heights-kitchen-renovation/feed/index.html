					<description><![CDATA[Hi there Jen! A month seems pretty good if you were renovating and fixing several things. I&#039;m still surprised by how quickly my kitchen was done.  My bathroom would probably benefit from a lift as well but it&#039;s in good enough shape/not so much an eyesore that I can live with it. But maybe somewhere down the line! And agreed, definitely a good next project.

And coquillek, since it&#039;s a 2-part series, the next part should show the kitchen itself. The last pic in this one is more like a teaser.]]></description>
