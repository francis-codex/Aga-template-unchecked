					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Lisa,
You did a wonderful job renovating your kitchen!  Your taste is exactly like mine... So can you tell me where did you buy the following items:
Back splash tiles, floor tiles (linoleum?), counter tops.

Many thanks, and enjoy many happy occasions in your new kitchen.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - Haven&#039;t checked this in a while so missed a bunch of questions!  The chairs are from CB2 (Orbit) and the tripod table is from West Elm.  The white one is discontinued but West Elm still sells a dark brown one.  The Open Your Heart print is actually something I drew and then framed.  The kitchen is probably about 12 by 7?

Hope that helps!]]></description>
