					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Like fellow Park Slope resident, Carol, Claire and Mike designed a custom kitchen island to replace a butcher block that had been too big and inflexible. The couple wanted the extra storage and counter prep option but didn’t want to anchor anything in place, so Paulina put the new island on wheels that let it sit against the wall or roll into the center of the kitchen. Paulina also cleverly added storage to the kitchen’s exterior line – the majority of that space is already claimed by interior storage and the oven, but Paulina tunneled into the section near the wall to give Claire and Mike an unusual storage nook for a section of cabinets that had never been accessible before.

					<description><![CDATA[thanks for all the kind comments! lowereastsider, i definitely recommend using base cabinets for awkward layouts - in fact you could even use wall cabinets as a base for narrow spaces, since they are only about 12 inches deep. (we actually used one wall cabinet and two base cabinets for our island.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So much brighter and happier, congrats, Carol! 

And I&#039;m so amused by the idea of the glossy black countertops messing up your depth perception. I never would have thought of it, but I totally get what you mean - so funny!]]></description>
