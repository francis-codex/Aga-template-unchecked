					<description><![CDATA[Hi Claudia and Dawn - thanks for your question. A basic kitchen in NYC typically starts around the $20k mark, but there may be elements of your project that push the budget higher depending on the scope of work and cost of the materials that you purchase. If you want more information, sign up for our newsletter to get our Ultimate Guide to Kitchen Renovation! Hope that helps!

					<description><![CDATA[That is gorgeous. I&#039;m wondering price as well because I&#039;m afraid to begin renovations as well and haven&#039;t a clue as to how much I might need as a single woman. 

Did you buy the materials yourself or let the contractor handle everything. 

It is beautiful.]]></description>
