					<description><![CDATA[Good luck with that Fisher Paykel, ours looks like a giant, expensive golf ball, denting every time we opened it! I covered it with a giant magnet/slipcover thing, but can&#039;t wait to redo the kitchen and get rid of it!]]></description>

I&#039;m struggling with the same issue. I want my counter top to be clean but i have so many appliances on it :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your kitchen looks vastly improved. I am sure you are enjoying your home much more than before.  I had been wanting to paint a bathroom wall dark blue, and now I will have the nerve to do it. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Guillermo.  Every kitchen and every situation is different so I don&#039;t think you would be able to go on exactly what Nick charged us, but I can give you a range and say it was between $!8,000-$23,000.  Keep in mind that figure doesn&#039;t include the cabinets, countertops, appliances, floor tile, backsplash, fixtures and lights.  The radiator is painted wood and has a brushed metal grille (from Architectural Grille in Brooklyn).  The front panel is attached to the body of the cover with heavy duty magnets so it can be removed easily for access to the radiator - designed and built by Nick.    -Lisa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lisa &#038; Brian 
At our co-op we have the same type of kitchen setup as yours. If you don&#039;t mine what was the actual cost by Nick Dillon from Nick Knacks Creative Interiors to refurbrish the entire kitchen? Is the new radiator enclosure is it metal or some other material? Thank you
