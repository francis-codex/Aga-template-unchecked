					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments and interest. While we can&#039;t publish the floor plan I can try to explain, and if you see us around we are always happy to show you the apt. sometime.
The panels when extended would create a hallway between the countertop and the windows. We will be installing Murphy bed, couch, chairs, etc, once we settle on some closet designs. The bathroom is to the right of the kitchen, and there is still the original hallway as well, which we are still deciding on how to use the space there. Sorry if it&#039;s hard to conceive. It really all makes sense once you are inside the apt.!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Mary D - I think it&#039;s commendable that parents would provide the privacy of a bedroom for their teenage son! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions on style and design but it seems a little unfair to criticize a family&#039;s sleeping arrangements in a one bedroom apartment. Others might take the bedroom for themselves (which is also understandable) but this solution works too. I think it&#039;s lovely and a testament to what a vibrant community they live in.]]></description>
