					<description><![CDATA[I prefer the old bathroom to the new one.  The new one is very dark and drab looking with all the dark tiles on the walls and floors, despite all the added lighting.  The floor tile is too taste specific and could be considered a fad. It would have been better used as an accent piece. If you eliminate the tub and base of the sink, you have the illusion of a deeper bathroom. Hopefully they have second bathroom with a tub as eliminating tubs in an apartment impacts resale values.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking as a short person, (5-2&quot;), I think around half of the built-in cabinet space would be somewhat if not completely inaccessible for me without a big step stool. It also strikes me that a great deal of stuff could and would get &quot;lost&quot; in the back of a cabinet with only shelves that is 2&#039;-9&quot; deep.  

Someone my size would be able to get maximum use out of this cabinet space if full height &quot;rolling pantry&quot; type storage was installed in this space -- something like 2 or 3 full height and full depth pullouts with adjustable height bins or shelves would be ideal.  (Possible 1 around 8-9&quot; deep for holding misc. bottles, 1 sized for a good width to store towels and other bulky goods, and 1 somewhere with a width in between.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Although the new bathroom is very nice, I actually prefer the old version more.  It looks more inviting and warm.  The new bathroom is kind of cold an institutional looking.  If that is what they were going fro, then it is right on the money.  I also like the option to have a tub.  But to each his own!]]></description>
