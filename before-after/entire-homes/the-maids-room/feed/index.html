Thanks! As far as the contractors we used it&#039;s a 50/50 split. Three of them are amazing, the other three not so much. I&#039;m definitely going to post about all of them soon and show clearly what each on of them did.]]></description>

I have been through similar stories,  but despite all the aggravations
