					<description><![CDATA[@LP - paint first, then floors. (All before move-in of course.) We also learned that the floors need to breath in the space for about a week before being installed so they can expand. So make sure you take that into account in your timeline! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A burning question from Prospect Heights!! Floors first or paint first?! Have been going back and forth with my fiancé on this chicken and egg question. Do you have the floors installed before you paint or vice versa?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sophia, it&#039;s only been a few weeks but so far we are really happy with them! We actually wanted a lower gloss than we ended up with but it would&#039;ve taken an additional 3 weeks to arrive and we couldn&#039;t wait that long because of our scheduled move-in date. So make sure you order it with enough time! :) Good luck with your reno!]]></description>
