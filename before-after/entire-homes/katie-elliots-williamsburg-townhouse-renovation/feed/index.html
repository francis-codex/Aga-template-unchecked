					<description><![CDATA[The dining room to kitchen is excellent, very clean and modern. Bathroom also beautiful. The arrangement of the living room could use some help though; seems a little awkward. Would try putting the TV where the large couch is and put the couch opposite to the TV; it&#039;s back a few feet from the entranceway. Then put that single seater to the left of the couch (if you were sitting on the couch). If that blocks the entrance too much, I would put tv under window and place large couch opposite that and rearrange other seating where the large couch is currently located. Still, you should be proud to be living in such a gorgeous space. Cheers!]]></description>
