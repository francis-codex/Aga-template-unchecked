					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] If you have a yard, there are a number of variables with budget implications. If you are demolishing older materials or removing debris from a neglected space, you will need to pay for the labor and removal before you get started with your new design. Homeowners with yards in urban neighborhoods need to plan for the unknown beneath the grass &#8211; many backyards only have a few inches of dirt and soil masking brick or bedrock or cement from prior owners. If you do dig up bricks or bedrock that will inhibit plant and tree growth, you can opt to invest in removal or you can supplement with planter boxes and a watering system. A crew of four for a day in NYC can come in at around $2,000. Irrigation ranges from $1,200 to $4,000, depending on how many planters and zones you need to cover, and the cost increases if you want to conceal the irrigation lines below patio or deck surfaces.
