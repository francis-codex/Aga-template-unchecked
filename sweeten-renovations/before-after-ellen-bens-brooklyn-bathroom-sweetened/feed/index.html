					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful work.  I described just such a door, (for my tiny bathroom that opens out onto a long, dark hall in my apartment), to a so-called contractor.  He replied that he had, &quot;never heard of such a thing,&quot; and, &quot;he didn&#039;t know where I could find a &#039;see-through&#039; door anyway.&quot;  Needless to say, he won&#039;t be be doing the work.

I would love to know where you guys found yours.  The opaque quality would be perfect for visual privacy, while allowing some light to brighten the hallway.

Thanks much.

*One question:  How is it in terms of N O I S E  control??]]></description>
