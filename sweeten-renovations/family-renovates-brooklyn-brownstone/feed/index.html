					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a suggestion for the window protection issue that I&#039;ve used, though it may not be elegant enough for your bathroom.  I installed a shower curtain rod across the wall, drilling into the tile using plastic anchors to secure it.  Then I installed a clear vinyl shower curtain with a raised pattern in it - it let sunlight into the room, but the pattern was enough to obscure the view in from the outside (though it looks like you&#039;ve done this already with the window panes used.)  Having the rod across the whole wall meant I could move the curtain over when I wanted to open the window.  You could cut the curtain it to your desired length at the bottom.  I was putting the same shower curtain rod and shower curtain on the other side of the tub, so it looked good in my place - with your glass there, you may not want a vinyl shower curtain on a shower curtain rod in there.  But it did protect all the wood trim and the wood window well.  Perhaps you can find a more elegant sheer material that is water-resistant, and use a smaller curtain rod than a typical shower curtain rod.]]></description>
