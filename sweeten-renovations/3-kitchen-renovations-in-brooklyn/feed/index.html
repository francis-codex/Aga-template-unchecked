					<description><![CDATA[I have lived in Clinton Hill coops since 1977. I have seen many renovations since going coop.#2 must be a corner apartment because it looks like the same layout as mine only I have 1 bedroom. Taking out the Pantry and closing off the door was brillient.It allowed for that huge fridge, which I love and it increased the footprint of the kitchen.The extra cabinets look like you have enough storage to compensate for the loss of the pantry and it gives plenty of additional counter space. Having the kitchen open up towards the dining room instead of the living room, as I have seen in most renovations done by Clinton Hill is much better. I agree with a prior comment tho that the sink could be a little bigger. Having seen the total reno on another webpage this kitchen really opens up the area while still maintaining a seperation between the Living Room &#038; Kitchen.
This is one of the best renos I have seen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am quite taken up with #1, I think the black &#038; white theme is sooo easy to live with, as well as being very sophisticated. I also fine the open floor plan and the way they have the Island set up, that it doubles as a breakfast bar/work area for two cooks ! The open selves give plenty of space for dishes with out giving the room a closed in feeling.It is perfect for two and has plenty of room when entertaining !]]></description>
