					<description><![CDATA[Interesting comment about ADA compliance. I wonder if there are provisions for older homes. My place has an entry hallway that is about this wide and would definitely not accommodate a wheelchair, so even if I could add another bath, making it accessible would be a lost cause because the whole place is probably out of compliance. My hallway looks about the same width as this one - what would be the point of making the door wheelchair accessible if the hallway isnt!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have this very situation. I am converting a half bath back to a 3/4. However, I am told that this bath must comply with NYC ADA requirements because it is considered a new bath instead of a restoration. This means the door way must be about 36&quot; to be accessible, among other things. 

This pocket door doesn&#039;t appear that large. How did you get around this issue?]]></description>
