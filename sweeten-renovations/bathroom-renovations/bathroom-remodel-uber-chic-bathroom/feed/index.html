					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Katie and Lance&#8217;s bathroom remodel in their Park Slope condo was sparked by water leaking into their bedroom closet. Seeking both functionality and aesthetics, they found a general contractor through Sweeten to update the entire space. Initially, the couple hoped to remove the glass partition between the shower and toilet. However, advised of a high likelihood for more water damage, they agreed to a more sturdy version with an elegant black trim. The new round mirrors, faucets, and fixtures all echo the black rim theme. Additionally, living in the apartment during construction proved challenging for the family of three. But, effective communication and a diligent contractor moved progress toward completion. [&#8230;]]]></description>
