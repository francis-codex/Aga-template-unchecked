					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] If you live in an apartment building—whether it’s a co-op or a condo—check the alteration agreement and house rules for adding a washer and dryer. Some buildings expressly prohibit it, others will allow existing units to be grandfathered in but will not permit new ones. A select number will allow it with the proper approvals and permits. “If your building doesn&#8217;t allow the installation of a washer and dryer, don&#8217;t take it personally,” said Sweeten contractor Majid. “There is a logical reason why. Older buildings have limited plumbing capacities that adding a washer may overwhelm. There is a higher risk of leakage and overflow as well as the potential for water or fire damage. Most boards won&#8217;t accept the risk or liability&#8221; and won&#8217;t allow it if the building is not already equipped for it. For this reason, it’s also not advisable to add one without approval. Should your unapproved appliances malfunction and damage units adjacent to or beneath yours, you’ll be responsible. If you live in a house that you own, there should be no problem since there are no boards to notify. In a rental, you’ll have to discuss it with your landlord, who may be willing to add one at his/her discretion.  (Above) Ashleigh + Jonathan&#8217;s studio loft bathroom [&#8230;]]]></description>
