					<description><![CDATA[I dont understand why everyone is so upset about the woodwork being removed. It is pretty clear that not only the homeowners, but the contractors as well, are quite knowledgable and in turn realize the importance of preservation. That being said, it is a given they would donate or sell the beautifully crafted, historic woodwork.  Are you all convinced that painting wood just to keep the design &quot;true to character&quot; is a better option than giving it to someone who actually wants it for their own space? There are many aspects of the original home that were kept and accentuated. Is that not apparent to anyone else?

Also, there are enormous differences in quality and style between a new construction and an older home. Everyone that is so uptight about the supposed &quot;destruction&quot; of this space should know that. 

I think the finished product is beautiful and, more importantly, a space where the owners feel at home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe just painting the walls white and decorating with the new furniture they bought sans the clutter would have given them a similar feel without tearing out original details. I would have tried that first. Some of the soul is gone now for me... I&#039;ve spent years putting these kinds of details back into my 1908 home!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not against painting wood, and the new paint job really does brighten up the room nicely.  Losing the fretwork threshold and the fireplace details is what breaks my heart.  Removing the threshold really didn&#039;t result in a gain of space, so I&#039;m not sure why it couldn&#039;t have been painted white with everything else or in a contrasting color to make a statement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love it! Get a grip people with the grim hanging on to the past at all costs. For goodness sake. It might have been lovely in flickering candlelight, but living with all that dark wood would have depressed me in electric light. And yes, I live in an 1860s house with tin ceilings, hand restored tung-oiled floors, marble fireplaces and Farrow &#038; Ball white everywhere. Great job!]]></description>
