Yes. It&#039;s from the H10 collection, H10 40U - 8108001 (they may have updated the model number). The dimensions are 15.7&quot; L x 12.6&quot; W x 4.0&quot; H. We chose that because it is a shallow bowl that left enough room underneath the vanity so it didn&#039;t affect the storage space.]]></description>

Hi Sarah, After reviewing the sink shape, model #H10 40U - 81080 looks like a close match! The vanity itself was a custom configuration, as the base unit is the Godmorgon vanity from IKEA and the drawer and side panels are from Semihandmade. Hope this help.
