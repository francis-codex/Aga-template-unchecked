Hi Mel, Thanks for reaching out. Since every remodel is different, here’s a link to our 2023 Bathroom Cost Guides (https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/). It’s the site visits that allow contractors to hone in more specifically on the costs based on your location, the existing conditions of your space, your scope, and the type of building you’re in. The guides will give you a starting point on costs. Thank you. —The Sweeten Team]]></description>
