					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Allyson, an avid traveler, purchased a circa-1920s home in Brooklyn knowing it needed to be renovated. She posted her project on Sweeten and was matched with a general contractor who replaced her bathroom with a more modern one. Allyson had collected artwork from around the world, so she wanted to make sure her love of culture was reflected in the ultimate design—and it was. Bringing rich, gold-bronze hues was one way to do so. She had brass-rod inlays laid into the custom floor.  And she sourced gold-brass sinks from Australia and installed similarly hued sconces.  [&#8230;]]]></description>

With so many different pieces and styles being added, she looked for simple tiling as a backdrop. Her solution: off-white marble-honed subway tiles. [&#8230;]]]></description>
