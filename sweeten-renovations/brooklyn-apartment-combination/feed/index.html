					<description><![CDATA[I was totally amazed at this beautiful transformation...until I got to the picture of the beautiful Cichlid fish in what appears to be a 1 gallon &quot;goldfish bowl&quot;. These social fish require at least 20 gallons of heated tank space. Very sad to see one by itself in a tiny tank. These world travellers should know better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lucky them that they were able to do this. It looks like a really beautiful space.

I&#039;m curious about the placement of the child&#039;s bedroom, near the front door. Why wouldn&#039;t the room that is currently designated as the &#039;family room/library/guest room&#039; be in that spot? Wouldn&#039;t it be better to have your child&#039;s room closer to you, to hear them in the night, etc?]]></description>
