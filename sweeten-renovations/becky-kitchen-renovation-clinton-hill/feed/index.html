					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Becky and Sarah moved in together with the intention of renovating their kitchen, but the project was put on hold. When it came time to renovate, the planning stage involved a few different versions until they settled on the right design; an open kitchen with shelves instead of upper cabinets. To make sure there was enough storage, they installed an island with pull-out drawers and nestled the fridge within cabinetry. While the project was stressful at times, the results were well worth the effort. Once the punch list was complete, the couple got engaged. “It could have torn us apart but in the end it bonded us together,” said Sarah. [&#8230;]]]></description>
