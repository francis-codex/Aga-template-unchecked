					<description><![CDATA[Love the makeover! Can you tell me what brand the stackable washer/dryer is? What is the dimensions of your kitchen? We are going to renovate a small house and it looks like your kitchen is similar; this house has no laundry room and I absolutely love the stackable next to the refrigerator.
Thanks for sharing your great space!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What an amazing transformation.  I am so impressed with the utility of the space, and the maximized use of vertical space, which is so critical in smaller spaces. I love the multi-functional flow of this redesign.  Great job, Nick Knack, owners, and, of course:  Sweeten!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!

My husband and I are currently going through a similar process in Chicago. We are renting - love our place, but not looking to buy it (nor is it up for sale). How did you negotiate or feel about putting a lot of money and elbow grease into your rental? Did you work with your landlord at all? Tips and suggestions are welcome!
Thanks! :)]]></description>
