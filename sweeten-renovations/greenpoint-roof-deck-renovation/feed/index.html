					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Nate and Michelle’s wanted their rooftop to double as a &#8220;bonus room&#8221; for hanging out, which meant it had to have comfortable seating and plants to make it feel cozy. Creating a visual barrier along the perimeter was important since the rooftop felt exposed, as well as incorporating a fire pit for chilly, late-summer nights. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good job!

But! If my project, I would have done a totally different floor plan layout for this deck.

For example, If possible, I´d have made the door open the other way around, (to save precious space and to take advantage of the great greenpoint views) and would have choose/pick other type of furniture (like an outdoor wood chaise lounge for one side of the door) and place them facing towards the skyline... also I would have added a retractable awning (among others) for sun and ligth rain protection, specilly if &quot;KID&quot; likes to hang around out there...

But! that is just my personal taste! Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As an owner with a terrace, I hope they have thought about the WIND that comes with the roof. Better have a place to put away those cushions and small table during storms and the unplanned weather changes of NYC. That furniture looks pretty light, I&#039;ve replaced mine with heavy steel or solid wood... Just saying from experience!]]></description>
