Hi Ciel, This homeowner&#039;s Sweeten contractor installed hardware on the glass shower panel. https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/ It&#039;s best to discuss what&#039;s possible with your contractor. Hope this helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the small bathroom renovation idea. My bathroom layout is similar to yours and I plan to install a towel bar for hanging my bath towel. Will it be suitable to install on the shower door?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really could relate to your project as I too had the small pink bathroom in a 1960 ranch. I am very fortunate that my husband is AMAZINGLY handy. He did the entire project himself including building the vanity. Now, it took some time but we had a spare bathroom. Like you we did not change the footprint. I love how beautiful the space looks. Very sophisticated. Congratulations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beautifully executed. I love how the late 30&#039;s-40&#039;s style pink bathroom evolved into 2021 without loosing the era it came. I clearly see and feel the clean, fresh, delicate approach to the new look. Congratulations!]]></description>
