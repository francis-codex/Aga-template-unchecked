					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Peggy and Jack enlisted the help of a designer, who was recommended by their Sweeten contractor, to re-envision their bathroom. They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity.
