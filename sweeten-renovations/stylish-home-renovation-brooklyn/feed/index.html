					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] This crafty couple in Fort Greene saved cash in more ways than one by DIYing their own Ikea. They also made all their own design decisions which really make the most of the new space. A great trick here is how the homeowners customized their Ikea cabinets by adding their own hardware that they purchased from a local shop. Also, like the previous kitchen, this one appears larger and less cluttered without an upper tier of cabinets. Instead, at eye level, the walls are used for display of framed art and objects on the open shelving. From the custom pulls, to the artwork, to the appliances &#038; countertops, this budget-friendly kitchen’s strength is in its careful curation. [&#8230;]]]></description>
