Hi Coco,
I&#039;d be happy to ask our contractor -- he was really great with all of this. We really based it on what was there before.  The real genius on our contractor&#039;s part was that he knew there was no way we could afford 14 inch crown molding (it would have cost $50-100 a foot at least). So he took 15 pieces of stock molding and replicated the old molding almost exactly using the stock pieces.]]></description>
