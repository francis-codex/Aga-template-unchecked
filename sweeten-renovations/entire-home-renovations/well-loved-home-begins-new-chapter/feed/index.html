					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] There’s always a risk of a personality clash when you pair two humans together. That includes your choice of designer or architect and general contractor. They could work together seamlessly, or they could not. Working with a design-build firm basically eliminates that risk. The design half and construction half would have worked together on many projects and likely created a firm together based on their positive collaboration. “Depending on the project, you could be working with them for six to 12 months, so it’s best to choose wisely,” said Mickley.

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Erica and Joshua, a newly engaged couple, planned on transforming Erica’s apartment—the home she had grown to love, despite its quirks, over the past 10 years—into the perfect space to begin their new lives together. The renovation focused on opening up and updating the kitchen. &#8220;We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy,&#8221; says Erica. Custom cabinets replaced builder-grade cabinetry and a new peninsula provided generous storage and a place for the duo to dine. &#8220;Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet. I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree,&#8221; she said. After speaking to their contractor, &#8220;Joshua was right. The floors needed to be replaced.&#8221; The apartment is now cozy—instead of cramped—and overflowing with natural light. At the end of the renovation, Erica found that there was so much more to love about her home. [&#8230;]]]></description>
