					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Lauren’s studio apartment definitely needed work. A home office in the place of what could be a large closet was not ideal, and the kitchen had more to offer than the undersized appliances provided. Working with her Sweeten general contractor, they rethought the space to make it as efficient as possible. Changes like skim coating and restaining the floors made a big visual impact. The smaller closet next to the bed area was converted into a built-in desk, while the former office space turned into a large custom closet. In the kitchen, the contractor came up with a genius idea to keep the existing cabinets that left room for a full-size range. [&#8230;]]]></description>
