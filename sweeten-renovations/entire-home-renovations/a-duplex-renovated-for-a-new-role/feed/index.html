The kitchen was the biggest update of the renovation. They chose a professional stove that they loved and matched their kitchen cabinets to the almost-black finish. This made their next choice easy: Offset the black oven with brighter gold accents. They did this by weaving gold through the cabinet hardware, as well as in the base of the elongated kitchen table.  [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nilda,
We&#039;re glad you liked this renovation. In this case, the homeowner did not have &quot;after&quot; floor plans but the &quot;before&quot; plans offer a sense of the space they were working with. We always try to include any plans that are available.
Thank you,
The Blog Team]]></description>
