					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Margery and Jim had been waiting for their opportunity to return to New York City. &#8220;Jim and I originally worked in New York and then Jim got transferred. We lived in the suburbs of Philadelphia for about 20 years and then when the kids grew up, we said now&#8217;s our chance to move back to the city, because we&#8217;re really city people,&#8221; Margery shared. They purchased an apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops with incredible views that also needed some work. After living in the apartment for six months, they were ready to remodel. The couple worked with their Sweeten general contractor to bring their industrial-meets-modern vision to life, and take down walls to maximize natural light. [&#8230;]]]></description>
