When the couple found out they were going to have a baby, they sprung into action. They needed a space that was conducive to their new family life. Tara and Ryan hired a Sweeten contractor to re-imagine their 1,200-square-foot apartment. In addition to a kitchen and bathroom remodel, the couple wanted a functional family/living room. &#8220;The vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design,&#8221; said Tara. &#8220;We wanted to re-expose the brick along the entire length of the living room wall.&#8221; This gave it the updated industrial look they desired. This long wall also allowed them to add much-needed storage. They had built-ins installed, which are perfect for storing toys, books, and other household items. It is now an ideal family room—both beautiful and functional. — [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Tara and Ryan found their kitchen to be functional, yet dark and musty. There was definitely room for improvement! Working around a column in the middle of the room, the couple was able to find a layout they liked. They achieved this by moving the kitchen island slightly to create more room. The show-stopping feature of the room is its now dazzling white appearance. A once dated and crowded kitchen was now open and bright. [&#8230;]]]></description>
