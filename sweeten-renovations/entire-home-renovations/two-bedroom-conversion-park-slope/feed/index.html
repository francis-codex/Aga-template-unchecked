					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Katherine and Chris were excited to find a two-bedroom in the desirable Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. What was not so exciting was the size of the renovation it needed. With the help of a Sweeten contractor, they were able to renovate the 1,000-square-foot space into the stylish home of their dreams. Their remodel impacted their dining space and kitchen; moving the kitchen from the back of the condo to the front. This allowed them to create an ideal open living room-kitchen space. The couple included a beautiful, natural wood table—an ideal eat-in kitchen that suits their lifestyle. [&#8230;]]]></description>
