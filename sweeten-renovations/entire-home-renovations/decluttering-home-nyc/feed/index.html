					<description><![CDATA[Hi Carolyn! I found the coffee table at Lillian August. I wasn&#039;t sure I had room for a normal-sized coffee table and was hesitant to have anything delivered. This was the floor sample, so I was able to skip the delivery fee and just walk out the door with it. The last two photos are from an apartment by Sweeten Expert Daniel. Will see if I can turn up the lighting source!]]></description>
