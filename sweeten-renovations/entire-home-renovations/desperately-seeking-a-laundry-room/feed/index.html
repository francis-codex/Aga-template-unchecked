					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Lynn and Craig really didn’t want to carry their laundry up and down five flights of stairs in their apartment building. So they decided to put a laundry room addition on top of their renovation list. The problem? No contractors were willing to take on the job of remodeling two tiny bathrooms, which included a washer-dryer installation. Then Lynn and Craig found Sweeten and hired a contractor who made it work.   When other contractors told Lynn and Craig putting in a washer-dryer was not a viable option, their Sweeten contractor disagreed. Other contractors insisted the only way to install was to tap into the toilet line and disrupt the neighbor below. Not a good option. So their Sweeten contractor came up with a workaround. He used the small sink’s line, and the couple bought a compact, ventless Bosch washer/dryer. Lynn and Craig now have a convenient laundry room to call their own. [&#8230;]]]></description>
