					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] As first-time renovators, Gina and Andrew learned a lot during the experience. They report that their biggest challenge was living at home during the renovation, with their dog, Brewster. However, Andrew also found it useful to be on-site during the renovation since he was able to check in regularly with the contractor and was able to follow along on the progress. While the removal of a load-bearing wall required architectural drawings to be submitted for approval, it was well worth it to have a kitchen more connected to the living and dining spaces. They also gained a breakfast bar by opening up a pass-through.  [&#8230;]]]></description>
