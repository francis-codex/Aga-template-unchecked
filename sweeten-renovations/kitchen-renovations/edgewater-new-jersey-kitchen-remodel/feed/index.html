					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Jennifer and Joe hired a Sweeten contractor to help them reconfigure their closed-off kitchen area in their New Jersey apartment. With views of the Manhattan skyline, the room needed a sophisticated update. To do this, they installed dark cabinets and white marble countertops. What really pops, though, are the gold accents: the modern chandelier and shiny bar stools immediately catch guests&#8217; eyes upon arrival. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Jennifer and Joe’s New Jersey kitchen renovation with Sweeten also included a redesign of their kitchen layout. They asked their Sweeten contractor to knock down a wall to get better sightlines to the wall of windows in their living room. Unfortunately, the entire wall could not be removed as it was load-bearing. So their contractor took down as much of the wall as possible but was still able to make a space that is great for entertaining. [&#8230;]]]></description>
