					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/#comment-82966&quot;&gt;NP&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi NP, Thank you. Sure, let me share some photos that might help, including a before and after of our floorplan. We had a pretty sizable entryway. I&#039;d placed a mod little settee there and while I liked the way it looked, the space wasn&#039;t serving much purpose. So from the beginning I had my eye on that as a possible dining area.

I sketched it up in a program to see if our round tulip table and Catifa chairs would work there, and I could see that it would. I drew up plans for my contractor to create a sideboard made of the same cabinets and doors as the kitchen and topped it with the same marble—to help establish it as the &quot;dining&quot; area and to tie in the design of the two rooms. Here are some before and after photos:

I have a very similar layout/dimensions of the kitchen and have been dreaming about putting a small dining table/breakfast nook somewhere, but it seems just too tight. Curious where your table stands. Thanks!]]></description>
