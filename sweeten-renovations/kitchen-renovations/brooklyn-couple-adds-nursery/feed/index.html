					<description><![CDATA[Hi Candy, The couple&#039;s bedroom remained unchanged and is still located on the other side of the kitchen seen in the &quot;before&quot; plan. The &quot;after&quot; floorplan depicts the areas included in the scope of the renovation. Hope that helps to clarify your question.
Thank you.
