					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] It will cost more to add a washer and dryer to a city apartment than it will in a house. “There are additional variables that get factored into the estimate,” Majid says. Contractors will consider the parking situation, the limits on working hours permitted by the building, and the greater liability of working in a multi-unit building. Majid also suggests that compact, stackable washer and dryers (electric and ventless) are the most suitable choices for apartment living. In the city, homeowners should budget $7,000 to $15,000 on average for a new washer and dryer, which takes many variables into play. The higher end of the range includes creating a closet for the appliances. In a house, because there are fewer complexities, the price range is lower: approximately $3,000 to $5,000 should get the job done. The higher end includes building a space or room to house the units. (Above) Gina + Andrew&#8217;s apartment renovation [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Gina and Andrew were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and in desperate need of a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. What made it complete? The floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and help keep all items stored, easy to access. [&#8230;]]]></description>
