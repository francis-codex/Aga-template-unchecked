					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jessica - if you&#039;re looking for a contractor, you can post information about your project at sweeten.com and get matched to hand-picked experts who are available and interested in your project. If you especially liked Sanaya&#039;s kitchen, you can note that and link to other inspiring photos so that we can get a sense of how you want your space to look. Hope that helps!
