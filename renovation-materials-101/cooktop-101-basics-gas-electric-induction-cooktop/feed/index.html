					<description><![CDATA[Your concise descriptions and advice on cook tops makes a great deal of sense. However, what I haven&#039;t seen dealt with is the oven or ovens available.  When the standard installation was a stove --- three or four burners or elements --- over whatever oven was built into the rest of the structure.  Then in came wall ovens.  My question is about ovens, whether integrated in stoves or installed separately as wall ovens:  whatever happened to ovens with doors hinged on one side?  My first three apartments in Montreal had gas stoves with side hinged doors.  At least a few wall ovens also had doors hinged on one side.  The great advantage to these is that loading or unloading cookie sheets, pies, cakes and larger, heavier casseroles like Le Creuset or my IKEA cast iron pot is easier and safer because you don&#039;t have to stand the oven door&#039;s dimensions away from the oven, arms extended, back bent.  Now that I am older I find myself wishing for a side opening oven because my aching back and hip joints protest every time I have to bend over to add anything to or retrieve.anything from the oven under the gas burners of my conventional stove.  A few years ago I think IKEA did have a wall oven that opened to the side. [ As well they had a four burner gas cook top that was laid out so the whole think was a longer, shallower surface on which the two front burners were nearer the corners and the two back burners were positioned closer to the midline toward the back edge  [oOOo]  but I haven&#039;t seen it listed recently.  It would fit where the standard depth cooktops would not.]  Anyway, does any manufacturer offer wall oven with a side-hinged door?]]></description>
