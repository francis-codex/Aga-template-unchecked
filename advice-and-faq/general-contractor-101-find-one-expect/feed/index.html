While Sweeten simplifies the search by personally matching vetted and licensed professionals to your project, you&#8217;ll still want to make an informed decision by having an in-person meeting. As you begin to schedule visits and solicit bids, here are a few ways you can prepare for a successful meeting with potential general contractors.
