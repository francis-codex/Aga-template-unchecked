Hi, Skim coating is a meticulous process that can be used on both finished and older walls to smooth imperfections and create a more level surface.

Hope that helps.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, The durability of walls and corners should not be affected by skim coating. A &quot;concave&quot; corner (where two walls meet on the interior of a space) that has been skim-coated is no more or less exposed or vulnerable to wear and tear than a corner that has not been skim-coated. Hope this helps!
