					<description><![CDATA[Hi Carol-Anne - it looks like all of the major national retailers (Home Depot, Lowe&#039;s, Best Buy, etc) offer washer-dryer combo options, ranging from $1,700 down to $800. LG seems to be the most ubiquitous option, but Haier also appears to be readily available in the US. Hope that&#039;s a start!]]></description>
