					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] If you’re interested in buying to renovate, consider applying for one loan to cover both. This simplifies the process by allowing you to do just one financing application, with only one set of closing costs. The lender will calculate how much of a mortgage you’ll qualify for based on the future value of the property, so you’ll be able to obtain a larger amount than if it was based on the current value. There is in this case also an FHA option, known as an FHA 203(k) loan. For more information on buying and renovating, check out our post, Options for Financing a Home Renovation.
