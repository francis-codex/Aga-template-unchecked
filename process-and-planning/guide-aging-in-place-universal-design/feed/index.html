					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Sweeten notes that wet rooms can be designed in adherence to aging-in-place guidelines, providing assurance for older home buyers and renovators. The remodeling service explains that those same principles, with a focus on practicality, safety, and accessibility, are suitable for younger and growing families, too. For example, parents of small children may find bath time a bit less strenuous. CCL Wetrooms advises the use of non-slip tile while Friel Lumber Company recommends floor mats as an added safety feature. [&#8230;]]]></description>
